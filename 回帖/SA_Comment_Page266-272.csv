Nice Green Day,
Wow beat up 🤕 today,
"i think cbl has a good chance of being a 10 bagger in 5-10 years.first it drops to $1, then ends up at 10. LOLLong cbl i plan to double down at 1-2.have seat belt fastened!",
"The CBL news release begins:  ""CBL Properties (NYSE:CBL) today announced that 2018 kicked off with strong January and February sales.....""   This is nice news for CBL.     I am not holding any CBL shares at this time but if I can I ask someone in this thread that follows this company close, how often do they make announcements like this and when was the one prior to this one?  If it is not a regular release, it sorta smells a little of desperation on their part.Thanks and GLTA.",
"personally, and I hate to say this, but i think we are on the cusp of another 2008 Great Recession this year.  All the problems are still in the system, but even worse, and with similar stock bungy cord valuations currently, and facing without any question 3 to 4 rate increases.  This will hammer cbl much lower and crush all the high flyers.  Hoping to get in cheaper but this is my gamble...........in 2008 there were bargain REITs for sale at pennys on the dollar..............I am gonna buy  6 month treasures and hunker down......",
"If in April the markets will move higher, CBL .will surf on top of this wave, in the next few weeks.",

"When AMZN was rising, CBL fell.When AMZN started falling CBL is rising.In a downturn, both CBL + AMZN will fall.The different is in their speed, their acceleration.AMZN  fall will hit mach 7.CBL in a turtle pace, possibly on their feet.At the bottom, there will a lot of co like them, in their current situation, paying high div, trying to attract investors.So, CBL is a very good lesson, but not a LT investment.",
Well looks like Amazon might get hit with taxes. Back to shopping at the mall for now 😂,
Trump and Amazon tax treatmentGOOD,
PVH reported blowout excellent  numbers. CBL has lots of there stores in there mall,
"Are there any studies comparing Amazon sales to brick/mortar sales?  And then layering in the rising tide of states imposing sales taxes on Amazon?Along with FB, they also had a big pass from being unaccountable and risky with customer data, not to mention getting a long time Wall Street pass from having to be particularly profitable.If you want another data point, there is the whole circus about Amazon opening a 2nd HQ.  Back in the telecomm boom circa 2K, companies building imperial HQ campuses was a top-tick sign.",
Went to 2 of there properties last weekend and they were absolutely packed. Took forever to find parking.,
"Long player you are right.Nothing will hold up or recover during a meltdown.But even if there is a meltdown cbl doesn’t have much left to drop lol.And you can carry that long into recovery.Compared to amazon, Nvda, Facebook ect.After a melt down it will take years for these high flying companies to recover to your entry if they even get there.I always say this and I’ll say it again.Statistically we have a meltdown every 5-7 years.We are going on 9-10 years now.Everything always looks amazing before the bloodbath begins.",
"I’ve passed by 3 major malls between 9-2pmParking lot is completely full.Every time I pass by these malls they are packed.This during working hours too!Added to cbl will add 10,000 easily if we see 2009 lows",
So today's WSJ spent almost a full page on articles saying that GGP was bought low and that there are a lot of REIT properties for sale with not very many bidders.  Elsewhere the WSJ said PE buyout funds are awash in cash.Not sure what to make of this as an individual investor since many REITs are trading near/at 52 week lows.  Is the WSJ chumming the waters to drive REIT stock turnover volumes?  Are they validating a bottom by being late to the party in pointing out that REITs are not making new highs?,

"Two months of good sales does not get CBL out of the current situation, but it is very positive news all the same.  On the cc, analysts were looking for CBL to pay down debt faster, but I think the company should use some excess cash to pay down debt.  Given the dividends saved, CBL would get back cash used to buy back stock in about five years.Management has a 2018 Plan, appears on track through the early part of the year to be ahead of that Plan, has a $10M reserve in the plan, and has hinted better financial projections are ahead in 2019 as spaces are leased (assuming no major tenant bankruptcy).  I'd like to see some sort of five year, 20M share, $100M buyback program - from any excess cash to get the share price back up.  Executing on the 2018 Plan is a quarter by quarter proposition that will not drive the stock price higher any time soon.",
Nice Green Day and ex div date tomorrow for cbl. What’s not to like right now! 💰,
"Sure online will increase, and sq ft will transform to more entertainment, medical, etc - did the space in the strip center down that had a blockbuster sit empty long? Sure a few malls in very small markets will close or transform to lower sq ft revenue  but has anyone ever driven by CBL malls such the one outside Nashville? Blood is on the street for CBL. Institutional ownership has drop to lowest level from 99% in 2015 to 67% 12/31/17. The shorts are currently have a hold on CBL with well over 20% shares outstanding sold short. Short as % of true float is very high. These guys think CBL going chpt 11 but I do not see it? $0.80 a year in dividend is going to be expensive to cover... time will soon tell if shorts are right? Shorts are responsible for drop in preferred as well. However, As long as cash flow can keep a solid dividend deposited ... I could careless if shorts keep price down",

"People read in the news that ""Macy's"" (insert any major mall tenant name here) is doing poorly and they just assume that every single unit of the chain is underperforming. I think we can all agree that Retail over expanded in a fit of ""more stores is the only way to growth"" mania. That doesn't mean that the End is near. It means that Macy's has to go back and pare the company back down to a manageable, profitable size. CBL properties are generally in areas where there is less competition and many of the anchor stores do well. These stores could easily become the core of a revitalized operation. There are other viable options as well. At the mall near me Sears sub-leased 2/3 of its space to Primark. But guess what? A year and a half later Sears is still there at 1/3 the size.",
I agree with something of the author hereBuy cbl  which is not equal to CBL,
"My local mall is a fairly large  CBL property in a strong middle class, middle American community.  They have a Macys, Pennys, Dicks SG, Younkers, big fitness center, a few restaurants etc and a trampoline place for kids, dozens of other stores.  I used to joke about the massive acres of parking around the place -- but on this past Saturday afternoon, the place was absolutely packed. It looked like the weekend before Christmas.. hmm...how can that be, they're all going out of business, aren't they?  Hmmm... ATVB,Don",
I would take one tenth of that price appreciation on the preferred D back to par.  even accounting for the 1st qtr dividend payable Friday it is down over  19% YTD  Big drag on my preferred portfolio.  Even if I believed all the rose colored crystal ball pronouncements published here I am fully invested and can;t commit any more dollars to this dog.  Also feeling it with PEI B down 11% YTD.  Turn off your computer and go to the mall and buy something.,

"LP, can you explain how you came up with a $20 stock value? With higher interest rates and probably a little more shares, it’s a home run even with a $15 stock. $20 seems impossible unless all of sudden their malls are fully leased and stabilized.",
Much better than CBL isCDR or SKT,
"Repurposing some of the retail space will enhance mall traffic. If financing is secure and reasonably priced, these areas will survive and grow. Finding tenants that are draws will be the challenge. Some things will always require actual b & m space. Entertainment, Dining, and Healthcare are “industries” that come to mind. Many “2nd tier” malls are in smaller population centers and don’t involve onerous transportation issues to access. Also, smaller, more boutique type of vendors can be draws. Profitability may not recover to prior levels but they don’t need to be to survive until better profit venues show themselves more clearly.",

"Well, that's certainly good news for CBL.  But it's not going to change the market perception much after the shock of the Q3 distribution and guidance reduction first dumped the price, and then significantly lower 2018 guidance finished it off (and its investment grade credit rating).  The company says that guidance was conservative, and that 2018 will represent a low point, but until it proves it, I suspect that the stock price will stay firmly planted in the mid single digits.",

Thanks for the article. However I have to disagree with the premise that GSK's new drug is 'better' than Biktarvy. I agree with Gilead's team in that I believe that a two drug HIV cocktail does not bode well against potential viral mutations after long-term use. My money is on Gilead here unless GSK develops a new viral target and adapts it into its cART therapy,
"great article, but it would be nice to know who wrote it.",
Bad timing SE.   I could have some bad timing with Gilead Sciences.  But you know I got 50 years to hold.   Time works for me.,
I should have bought more shares today.   I already have 40% position in my portfolio so I will buy only if it falls to $64/share.    I bought MO instead PM today.,
"Although I do like GILD's future prospects given it's entry into the CAR-T and it's leading position in anti-virals, I rather agree that 2018 doesn't look great.  GILD did have that super low PE going for it, but now the PE is at 20 so I don't see it as a great buy right now.  I've held one share for the past several years just to keep tabs on the company.  The main thing that might drive the share price up in 2018 would be the CAR-T space catching even more fire, which is possible.  However, no revenue will be coming in for GILD in this space.  Another possible driver would be a smart acquisition, but you can't count on that.",

If you look at the earnings slide for Q4, there is something called Yescarta for second line Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL or DLBL) now in phase III.   My understanding is Gilead will go after 200,000 blood cancer patients in the United States.   That's a substantial growth area.   EPS will bottom at 6.  2019 will start to grow.   Stem cell transplant, surgery, and chemo will be obsoleted in the not distant future.If you do not put your head in the sand, gene editing will likely be the future of new medicine.   Gene editing will be the holy grail of cure for many difficult genetic diseases, cancer, and viruses including HIV/AIDS and hep B virus.   Gilead is well positioned to take advantage of the cure for cancer and many other life threatening diseases.  Medicine is top notch.  Business is doing well with a large profit.

"The Owl and Flipper,I appreciated reading your discussion (and it's interesting that you seem to agree on quite a bit).  I like the idea of buying longer maturity debt in the range of 50-60 and having the coupons reduce your risk to 30.  If there is a bankruptcy owning at 30 seems to give you a good cushion.  However, figuring out whether the company or, more probably, it's assets are worth enough to make 30 cents on the unsecured debt a good deal is beyond my pay level.  Do either of you have the time to explain why you feel the assets will have enough value to in 4-5 years to make this a good play?Thanks,Tom",
"ccn3,Once you get comfortable with it, you're likely to find trading with accrued interest easier.  It means that you don't have to worry about so much about the date the bond pays interest.

Up because earnings will be coming out not unusual for the stock to trend up before earnings. Shorts have a lot to worry about! Will not be able to control the narrative much longer!

"Has anyone looked into Frontiers bonds 10.5% and why the dealers seem to be daytrading that bond and the third party keeps lowering the price scaring the hell out of thin skinned investors who end up selling for a loss. Then the company and their vultures come in and buy off the street at a fraction of what they would pay if they called the bonds.Have not figured out why the bonds are priced so low it has to be all the day trading and shorting going on and the buy back offer from frontier was a joke.Did they expect investors to sell them back to the company or did the company offer a low buyback price then went to the street and purchased them for slightly more.Either way the investor is getting screwed when a company does or says something creating market turmoil and skepticism then when the bond prices fall they go in and scoff them up.Sounds far fetched but take a look at the past year of activity concerning this bond and it will make sense especially when as soon as the bond prices fall then the company acts like it is offering to buy back the bonds at a reasonable price when in fact they were the reason the prices fell in the first place and are now taking advantage of it.The covenants of this bond specifically states that if called in March of 2018 a premium has to be paid so why are they aloud to, first offer less then the call amount and why in the hell are they aloud to buy from the open market, especially when they deliberately cased the bond prices to drop.Remember who benifits more when the bond prices drop, the investor who paid top dollar or the company!!!SEC needs to investigate what these companies are doing, just look at Windstream 06/01/2022 bonds cause they did it also.",
Dead man walking. I believe they can come back but they wont. they need to. 1) slash pay. 2) sell non performing assets. 3) offer a bond buy back at 60%. 4 issue more stock.  5 threaten BK 6) cut capx to near zero.. They just have tooo much debt.,
Close today above 50 day moving average of 7.82  Technical support hasn't helped in the past but worth mentioning if FTR can hold this level in the coming days.,
"When the reasons for this strength are known in the following days/weeks, this could be the upside move some of us have been anticipating for months.",
"Whatever it is, it isn’t just today for ftr has been quite strong for days in spite of all the gambling going on in the markets. The picture is becoming quite clear as to why three funds own over 1/3 of the company and more particularly why Blackrock doubled down the stake in Q4/2017.",
no comments today? didn't see anything material on the wires today with the exception that FTR will not be affected by China embargo :),
One more thought before I move on. With over 40% short that comes to over 30 mill shares conversion will add 25mill shares. Like one post said the stock that has been hedge wont be sold it has already been sold.,
"So lets change the subject from bk to share dilution. What should be the news from this story is Q1 -.11 Q2 .10 Q3 .30 Q4 .50 or 62 mill profit 2018. Q1 consensus is -.89 looks like wall street is off .78 but of course they are right on earnings but some how have miss priced the stock by 3 dollars. Remember there are still over 40% short they will need to cover. When Q1 and Q2 come out and $FTR beats consensus again what will the stock do. Remember its not zero or higher any more it is ""only higher"".",
"FTRPR has been trading down with FTR all yr. It is not what happens at conversion that matters the market has already priced that in.

But what if stock starts to move higher? Then the shorts will have to cover. Since no one believes stock goes to zero anymore then the answer is "" it only goes higher"". Number 8 is my pick adjusted EBITDA Q4 was 41.5% and co. is targeting > 40% EBITDA.",
FTR saying they have no more secured capacity left because of the indenture on the 10.5-11% bonds sold in 2022.  ugh........,
"I think we've both spent enough time on this.I don't think FTR's share price will be affected by the conversion (at the time of conversion, or otherwise in the short run) and I interpreted your earlier statements as claiming that they would.Good luck to you.",
That didn't paste very well. The $2 million is a credit to common stock. Gotta keep those books in balance!,
"Thanks. So Example 5 appears to apply in this case.""Convertible preferred stock""Some preferred stock issues may carry a provision entitling the shares for conversion to common stock. They are called convertible preferred stock.Example 5""If Company A instead converts the 100,000 preferred shares to $10-par common stock on 2-for-1 basis, the transaction shall be recorded as follows:Preferred stock	           3,000,000	Common stock		                                 2,000,000Common stock-additional paid in capital		1,000,000""In a 2-for-1 conversion, 100,000 preferred shares shall be converted to 200,000 shares. If the stated value is $10 per share, credit to common stock account would amount to the product of the number of common shares issued and the par value. The difference shall be credited to the additional paid-in capital.""So for FTR, please answer the substantive questions. How will the conversion dilute the net book value per common share and the earnings per common share?Could it be that it won't do either, or at least not by a third?Thanks again.",
"Mr. Dinky, first of all, thanks for identifying my typo. Appreciate it.Hmmm. Sounds like you're back-tracking a bit on the price impact of the conversion.  But, of course, I could be wrong in that regard.Mr. D., it's clear that you're an accountant.Please tell us readers what the Company's journal entry will be to drop FTRPR (that it sold at $100.00 per share) upon conversion into the common. And then explain to us how that constitutes dilution of the common. I think you have a full grasp of the number of FTRPR shares issued and outstanding, so the bookkeeping should be pretty basic, right?Other readers may be as curious as I am to learn how the conversion will dilute the book value per common share. And how removing the preferred dividend of $2.78 per preferred share per quarter will dilute future earnings per common share.I'll appreciate the education even more than having you find my typos. Thanks in advance.",
"If I'm reading his posts correctly, Mr. Dinky thinks that FTR will lose one-third of is value upon conversion of FTRPR to more FTR shares. That's like going from $9 per share at the close on Friday, 6/29, to $6 at the open on Monday, 7/2.If you agree with that (I don't), you should be selling short or buying puts. You decide.",
"Typically if a firm files, the courts take a multiple of expected EBITDA and use 30-40% debt amounts as allowable to exit. Not much dissimilar to what the banks require for you to get a mortgage on your house.A very simple view of a FTR recovery (as Munger says, to pass a basic smell test)If we use a basic 5x multiple on $3b EBITDA is a $15b EV. Take $2b in legal costs brings you to a $13b exit value. Using 40% debt to equity means $5b of debt would be allowed for them to exit Chapter 11. Everything else is converted into equity or $8b equity value.Presently there is $5b in secured debt. Assume this is par recovery and possibly rolled over. So now the present $18b in debt, minus $5b secured debt means $13b in unsecured debt has to fit into $8b in equity value. This implies low 60% recovery value in equity. Also assume more secured debt will be used going forward or asset sales that reduce EBITDA. So 50% par seems a reasonably good risk/reward. Depending on how much secured debt is used is important because the negative effect is levered on junior debt (more secured on top of junior debt). Your analysis should assume all senior debt is par recovery. Give yourself room to be wrong on your buy prices.FWIW.........",
"Owl,Do you have any sense in cap ex totals what is maintenance and what is growth cap ex (revenue enhancing)?",
"Owl,Thank you again for the extensive work you share. As any distressed situation, if you can make a case with below expectations and still have it work, it's work well spent.""""but this senior secured capacity will be used to refinance a piece of the substantial $2,188M tranche due 2022""You mention ""secured capacity"" but do you know what it is presently? This is critical as you know because it's their ability to deal with maturies in ""unforseen times"". They need easily, IMHO, $2-3b in liquidity triggers (money quickly accessible) before I could say Chapter 11 is off the table. An untapped $850m revolver is a huge bonus.This would be very valuable information to know, how much more 2nd lien could they issue? How much capacity is left at the 1st lien level? How much are assets collateralized in total? It was 70% before I believe.If I felt they had $4-$5b in easy liquidity triggers I meant sell all my bonds and buy only stock.I realize that writing these messages means spending a lot of time responding to us nay-sayers. What's is an interesting conclusion to debt reduction theme is also a few points.1) The EV of the company will be greatly reduced. 2) the result of this is the equity to EV become interesting. Using $7 common    a) Using $17.8b in debt plus $1.9b in preferred, present market cap to EV is $560m or 2.7%     b) after the preferred conversion equity to EV is 4.1%     c) Each billion of debt removed means the equity become .003% more of the total firm.       d) so all the benefit to debt removal goes directly to the equity class and it's percent of future cash flow increases.Of course this takes time but the effects get very interesting over time.",
"""But it aint gonna happen upon conversion. All known facts are discounted into today's price of FTR and, surely, the facts of this conversion are well known.Markets are not perfectly efficient but they are undoubtedly efficient enough to have this figured out. All except apparently you.I surely hope you are man enough to come back here on July 2 to admit your flawed thinking.""The above I believe is exemplary of the people referred to above by Silent Trader who have ""explained"" why FTR shares losing 1/3 of their value upon issuance of 25.6 million shares to new owners will not sink the pps. What is said above are merely declarative statements based on the bias of someone rationalizing away the math. Some here are unable to see the difference between a stock split or stock dividend compared to an equity secondary offering which is what FTRPR was. When FTR did the 1:15 reverse split the ownership interest of each existing shareholder stayed the same. But on 7/2/18 each share of FTR outstanding on 6/29/18 will lose 33% of its ownership -- 1000 shares effectively become 667 shares when measured in ownership interest in the corporation. PS -- I noted the ""man enough"" remark. You can't address the actual issue so you attack the messenger. You're not ""smart enough"" to understand it.",
"Mr. Dinky,We're only 93 days away from the mandatory conversion.  All of the marbles are aligned with virtual certainty. If the the price drop in FTR that you're predicting upon conversion were really going to happen, there would have been a massive sell-off already. (I'll acknowledge that in fact some of that sell-off has already happened.)  But it aint gonna happen upon conversion. All known facts are discounted into today's price of FTR and, surely, the facts of this conversion are well known.Markets are not perfectly efficient but they are undoubtedly efficient enough to have this figured out. All except apparently you.I surely hope you are man enough to come back here on July 2 to admit your flawed thinking.",
"Mr. Dinky-dot-bomb, your analysis is just as flawed here as it is on yahoo. As June 29 approaches, maybe it would help you to think of FTR and FTRPR and two classes of the common stock (say FTR.A and FTR.B, respectively). After FTRPR goes ex-dividend in the middle of June, in effect that's what they are, with each B share equal to 1.333 A shares. The combined capitalization of the Company before the conversion (that is, the total value of FTR.A plus FTR.B shares) will be the same as after the conversion when the A and B shares revert to one class.Get it?",
I switched from Spectrum to Frontier and their equipment works fine and the service is good.,
I hope folks realize this is a company putting up a service and products that are pretty good IMO!   I have internet service with them and it is excellent!     Payment system is little bit of a pain but other than that I like the service and the Price and contract!  Just my 2 cents worth.,
"Owl,You provide the best coverage on FTR on Seeking Alpha bar none.  You probably also provide the best coverage in existence, but I've stopped paying attention to the Wall Street analyst reports I have access to.  Like Groucho Marx, I wouldn't want to be a part of (use) any club (Wall Street analysis) which would have me (be provided to me).  :)Just to make sure I understand your cases correctly.  In case 1, the company doesn't ""crash and burn"" in 2023, it just needs to be able to refinance $1.5 B worth of unsecured debt.  Is that correct?  Under case 1, your worst reasonable case scenario, what is the expected Debt/EBITDA ratio at that time when unsecured debt refinance is necessary?One thing I think would also add to your analysis is more on the potential downside for debt.  For instance, what would be necessary recovery in case 1 on your PIY by the time they actually need to refinance the unsecured?  How about the 2022 and 2023 debt?  (Yes, I'm leading you.  I want to see if you independently come to a similar conclusion to what I already have.)",
"Maybe I went through the article too quickly and missed something, but I understand you assume no refinancing, so all unsecured debt should show up as debt redeemed in the graphs. I notice however that the debt redeemed does not match the unsecured debt in the table. E.g. sept 2022 2188m of debt matures, but the graphs only reaches to about 1700. What am I missing?",
"Thanks Owl, I am long FTR bonds :)",
thanks Owl for this great article ! looking forward to the next one regards Alex,
"Thank you, Owl, for balanced, thoughtful, and up-to-date analysis.  If bankruptcy can't be averted, I don't see it before another five or so years.  After the 1-for-15 reverse split, my break-even point is just under $150 a share.  I acquired this stock (actually its predecessor, Citizens Utilities B) a long, long time ago, and I can now serve as example to others at this forum of the high price paid for being too busy to give close attention to a company's changing circumstances over the years.",
why would you long piy when you can buy actual underlying bond for a cheaper price?,
"There is probably no publicly traded company that can generate cash to pay off debt without refinancing. That is also true of every government entity. The short algos rule, complicit with the predator financial world prevalent in modern finance and have done a good job of undermining FTR. FTR is one of  several they intend to destroy. More sectors and companies will be targeted in the future due to an equally corrupt government. The hedge funds/private equity/banksters are licking their chops as the fleece unwary, unsuspecting shareholders and creditors.",

"Thanks for all of your hard work on this name, including the current article. My income portfolio includes the 9.25% Notes due in 7/21. Current yield @9.5% and YTW @ 10.3%. Good luck to all.",
Except for the rosiest picture - they will need to refinance to meet 2022/23 maturities. Give the high probability of such need - I am inclined to think they would be well served pursuing the max discount notes in the open market with about $100M-$200M per year. Decent chance they could retire close to $1B over five years leading up to that wall - and save $80M/year of interest expense. There would still be ample cash available to buy down some of that maturity too. At some point - they have to work under the assumption that they will have opportunities for refinancing over the next 4-5 years.,
"Thank you for a clear and thoughtful analysis. I am long 2025 bonds. It is part of the ""high risk / high return"" portion of my portfolio. I can sleep a little better after reading your work. There is still a lot to be done at FTR, but I think some pieces are falling into place.",
Buy PIY n hold. Pretty easy.,
"As the June, 29 conversion date approaches, FTRPR value will approach the market value of FTR. There are 19,250,000 FTRPR shares outstanding, and at conversion of FTRPR into FTR at 1.33 there will be an additional 25,602.500 FTR shares outstanding. The current 78,410,000 shares outstanding will increase by 32.7% to about 104 million FTR shares outstanding.  If the market price of FTR at the June conversion is the current price of about $7 then the stock should open at about $4.71 +/- the bid for the stock on 7/2/18. So at the current FTR market price, a share of FTRPR will be worth about $7 at conversion. Plus of course the final dividend payment. The Q1 results could move the needle either way. This observer saw little to be hopeful for given the meager sequential improvement in customer disconnects during Q4.",
"Thanks, very good article! The 2022 unsecured bonds represent the best risk/reward at this point of time.",
"48490653: ""... the only reason I invested in FTR, was on the basis of that attractive dividend..."".The dividend was always going to be cut at some point following the CTF acquisition.   You're probably one of the very few dividend investors still left in this name.   The balance are equity stub investors betting on the leveraged return that will accrue in the event that FTR can stabilize and sufficiently deleverage.  I'd say the odds of that occurring are about 60/40 in favour.  Assuming the prospect of even the bleakest scenario taking shape some time before 2022, there are numerous corporate actions that management will be able to take to deleverage and maintain liquidity.  At FTR's current price, the market has priced in the certainty of a scenario the present facts for which are far more finely balanced.",
"The loss of dividend hurt me badly. If I am honest, the only reason I invested in FTR, was on the basis of that attractive dividend. As a long option, without a div, there are less risky places to park money.  it is difficult to understand, why anyone would buy this stock, right now. which explains why the price keeps going down, regardless of fundamentals or analysis, or the div being dropped. Many assumed, wrongly, that this would behave as CTL, did, but that's not happening.  My question is, what are the prospects of FTR bringing back a dividend, in the not too distant future, if this all works out?  If they survive and are sorted out by 2023, and the price manages to recover to some extent, the only reason to hold at that point, would be the though of getting that substantial div back.If there is little hope, I am highly tempted wave the white flag, and cut my losses.  I am kinda hoping that they decide to offload some assets, to get out of the mess they go themselves into. We have already seen that just a the rumor of that can have a dramatic effect on the price.",
"This is excellent analysis, Owl -  regardless of whether one is bullish or bearish on FTR.",
"Well done!  If you were the CFO at FTR, what would you do?  It would seem a way forward would be to sell an asset and pay down debt.  Is there a buyer?  Would cash flow improve   (less revenue more than offset by reductions in interest and capital expenditures)?  If FTR was considering such a move, would that imply that they have doubts in their ability to resolve this coming debt payment issue?  If they are not considering an asset sale, does that imply confidence that their plan forward is on target?  What are insiders doing lately?",

"based on your analysis, even if business fail due to financial conditions, by 2023, with ev of at least 12 billion, and secured debt of 4 billion, unsecured debt of 10 billion, even if secured debt gets paid back 100%, the unsecured should recover most of their principle back.  what doesn't make sense is why long term bonds are trading at 50c on the dollar today. what is the risk of owning frontier long term unsecured bond?",

"The price of this stock makes no sense at all. When oil tanked in 2016 this stock was between US$4-$5. Today oil at around $65 the price remains below $3??. Either this stock is being manipulated or the market is daft. And in fact it should make no difference whether Baytex sells assets now or not in a well priced oil environment, since the key is actually having those assets when the price of oil is on an upswing. (It would be a worrying situation if oil was headed the other way). If oil's rise is maintained this year, the market will realize what an opportunity this was, but then it will be too late for a lot of small investors.",
"For a long time now we’ve read/heard commentary on Baytex advising us to keepcalm and not worry, because no big debt repayments are due until 2021. That was a soothing song two years ago. But no longer. Baytex, this year or next, will hear funeral music unless they grow a pair and sell assets to pay down debt. And ideally it’s the deadweight Canadian assets that should go.

"My 2 cents on the topic; Q1 closes this week and we have seen the WTI oil prices averaging in Q1: Jan=63.66 - Feb= 62.18 - March=61+ US$ BTE has been able to present very encouraging results in Q4 2017 with an oil price averaging US$ 55 on the period. I have 10K+ shares of BTE and Q1 2018 results (with a US$62+ price average) will be the base on which I will either increase VS sell my position since I feel - and this is a personal perspectives - we will not see sub US$58 oil price going forward (at least for a long period) while momentum seems to be positive for higher oil price (backwardations, geopolitics, Aramco IPO pushed in 2019, WCS/WTI narrowing, ect…).I think it worth holding a little it more until next publications since BTE will most probably be posting in May and we will have enough visibility with Q1 results + oil price value in April for everybody to make their forecasts.Ultimately; we all agree a significant transaction will need to take place at some point in 2018/2019 to immediately lighten the 2021 & 2022 debt terms",
"Long Player: I sold off much of my BTE based upon your prior suggestions / articles; ie, not a huge cash flow improvement in Q4 at about $60 WTI and quite challenged to grow production.  I upped my positions in MCF and EPE based upon your general positive thoughts on those companies.  Do you still feel ‘decent’ about MCF and EPE?  Any other beaten down e and p companies you prefer?  Ie, BXE?  Thanks.",
"BTE is a great opportunity if oil stays above $65 and a very poor play sub $50. You can place your bets based on your own outlook for oil. I have a small position of 3000 shares in the event oil stays strong. This is not a stock that anyone should consider an "" all in"" investment unless you are certain of a high oil price.",

Google’s Capex and SBC together are approaching $30 billion a year, swallowing up practically the entirety of Google’s operating cash flow.  Back in 2012, both Capex and SBC we’re far less insane.  And precisely because of that, Google’s FCF today is no higher than it was back in 2012 at about $12 billion a yeD, because Google’s  Capex and SBC have skyrocketed over 500% since then.  This pretty much kills any gains in revenues that Google would otherwise enjoy.",
"Google is worth $333 while FB is worth $75.  This is simply from the fact they each generate only about $11-12 billion of FCF per year, which is woefully inadequate to support and sustain any market cap above $250 billion over the long term as interest rates revert back up to historical norms from their current near-70 year lows.

"Right now ALL sales of medical cannabis in Canada are online. When a person gets a prescription they need to choose a provider (licensed producer), they then go through a verification process with the provider, they order online and the product is shipped to them. A person may only sign up with one provider at a time to fulfill their prescription (sometime they are able to split their prescription between 2 providers)- in order to move their prescription to another provider they need to delist their prescription with the one they are currently with in order to register with a new one. The federal government has said that the medical cannabis system will not change upon legalization of recreational cannabis, so moving forward all medical cannabis sales will continue to be online ONLY. So it’s more a matter of Namaste being able to attract customers to purchase from them rather than directly from a licensed producer provider. My understanding is the advantage in registering and fulfilling your prescription with Namaste is that they will be offering a variety of cannabis brands through their online store, meaning that if patients are registered to fulfill their prescriptions through Namaste, they are easily able to switch brands and try a variety of products without needing to delist with one provider and re-register with another.

No. Plus their deal with Supreme is not great. $6/gram is a bit of a rough wholesale price considering that the wholesale price to the SAQ in their recent deal was about $4/gram.

"SE, I don’t disagree with your conclusion that the margins in renewables are lower and probably stay there. I do disagree that the renewables are that disruptive to power’s market potential. I tried to indicate that GE made at least two management mistakes, they projected too optimistic demand for the gas turbines and manufactured ahead to supposedly meet the demand which ddn’t materialize( by the way I have a hard time understanding how a product which generally has a long lead sales cycle could have such a large misestimate) and that margin realization on Alstom’s maintenance contracts were assumed when the acquisition of Alstom occurred. My disagreement with your article is that the power margins need to be the same as renewables. I believe a 400 m investment in a giant off shore windmill is not a wise investment and the true margin decrease in power is primarily due to a very broken integration process for the Alstom acquisition whereby management was so intent on acquiring Alstom they didn’t manage their existing business and then didn’t take the appropriate personnel reductions that had been assumed to justify the acquisition.",
"Energy is Energy. You can buy coal energy, Nat gas energy, oil energy, nuclear energy, hydro energy, solar energy, and last but least wind energy. It all works the same, why would it not then be subject to the same market pressures?Answer: Idiot half thinkers that believe Wind and solar are an alternative to cheaper energy, solar and wind have hidden costs and environmental long term costs that the starry eyed half wits NEVER include in their political agenda. GE is making another stupid move. Germany has learned this the hard way but the tree huggers refuse to learn.",
"This analysis is way off the mark. The fact is that GE did make that commitment to build the largest off shore windmill in the world, I believe this commitment is almost foolish. If the author looks at his own graphs, they show that the profit in power recently converged to that of renewables. In the face of this reality he thinks that the investment in renewables will replace the loss in power revenues. The facts are that the margins in windmill equipment are very low. By GE statements themselves, larger margins in the renewables are in maintenance contracts subsequent to installation which is also low margin. In the case of the big off shore windmill, maintenance contracts won’t  priduce  any meaningful profit until 2021 or beyonfm if then. Meanwhile I have verified with GE spokesman that part of the decline in power margins had to do with a) too optimistic projection of gas turbine demand and a build ahead to level load the factory in 2017 and b) the realization that the principle benefit to profit of the Alstom acquisition was to come from increasing margin in their fielded base maintenance contracts which were at half of the existing GE margins. This could only be realized by reducing  existing labor costs in the Alstom acquired business. Supposedly this is the  primary reason for the .12000 personnel lay off",

"Can’t agree more that GE’s bet on Offshore will be costly with SIemens Gamesa and Vestas dominating the market with years of  experience in the risky offshore execution and operations let alone the fact that GE’s announcement was to “develop” a 10MW turbine.

Some times the wind don't blow and the sun don't shine and at that time You need to draw from the BATTERIES that stored the energy when the wind blew and the sun shined.  Today people think Trump is starting a trade war with China.  That war started 25+ years ago and the USA has been losing badly.

Turbines aren't going away. In fact, growth is expected to pick up substantially, especially when all the electric cars get on the grid. Can you imagine the increase in power demand from millions of electric cars, especially at night when they are recharging? 4) GE has a huge technology moat in every one of its business sectors.

"We're still in the Wild West phase of this whole mishmash of social networks and capitalist profiteering.  The capitalist economy doesn't currently value a platform like FB for the experience, because people aren't paying to log in like they do at Disneyworld or Netflix.

(YouTube is too intrusive now, with 90sec ads that you can't cancel preceding 60sec videos, and breaking in the middle of longer videos!)  Then in FB and GOOG's case we get our personal information being sold to the highest bidder (or all the bidders).  They are inventing new ways to ""monetize"" us daily, and some seem pretty hostile and frankly scary.You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to value your privacy enough that the idea of face-to-face personal conversations being recorded by your Alexa unit, your Samsung TV or the phone supposedly sleeping in your pocket, then sold to corporate interests... is a bit concerning.This frontier needs to be tamed, with pointed legislation.  There needs to be lines that the data pushers can't legally cross.  (For example, if Joe agrees to give up his info, that should not also surrender the info of a couple hundred people on Joe's friends list who did *not* opt in.)People are welcome to their opinions about where those lines should be drawn.  Personally I would like to see a pretty severe crackdown on deceitful practices in general.  Content that is just a facade on top of a personal information mining business should be quashed, imo.If Farmville (random example) can't find a profitable market based on its merits as an enjoyable game, and has to resort to shady hacks on users' privacy to be viable, then maybe it should just go.  (Or maybe we need to overhaul how society judges value, but that's a much bigger challenge!)One idea that might work - What if the opt in screen (""App1234 needs access to your friends list, photos, camera, phone memory and microphone, do you accept?"") was required to itemize the top 90% sources of revenue for the app?""Selling the transcripts of my business meetings to Asian manufacturing competitors, and selling pictures of my children to human trafficking rings?

What’s the difference between Facebook working with Obama’s second election to provide data and a third party company using the same data for Trump’s election? Is Zuckerberg apology applies to both cases?,
all the talk abt fundamentals....no arguing there but the technicals look awful right now.,
"In earnest the main play here is btw FB advertisers & FB users. Advertisers are major source of FB income with the users / their data being the product sold. Off-course for FB to stay in business, it needs both parties. Question is, who is more concerned abt bridge of data? On a general sense, FB needs its paid advertisers who needs users data to promote their targeted advertising which hopefully increases their bottom line. Being that the only person who pays nothing here is the user, chances are their loyalty for FB will remain unmoved. Come to think of it, FB didn’t create or change anything abt any users data. Most of that was created by the user themselves or gathered by FB from their browsing habits. Being most people use this platform for free, I find it hard they will be willing to delete accounts or change their attitudes towards FB after this scandal. In fact many millennials nowadays use social media as a backup tool for their files and content. They will go back to FB to retrieve a pic they posted a decade ago cuz that’s the only place they are likely to find it. It’s like giving up the keys to ur personal storage while still having all ur belongings there.      That said, it will be interesting to see a user come forward and acknowledge that their FB data was used to brainwashed their thoughts n votes. Like most articles have published, Cambridge Analytica’s goal was to fortify the believe of many by targeting adds which will reinforce inherent political views in sort of an augmented reality.        In fact, I strongly feel, this scandal is just the genesis of future advertising content. I mean, why throw an add at thousands of users and hope you can persuade a mind when you can just just target specific adds to individuals based on their habits. It maybe just a fear of humans to think a machine is getting smarter than us but won’t you love to walk into a store and find all the items on your laundry list align on the front shelf as you walk in? Won’t you like your car drive up to you just about when you leaving from work and it’s pouring outside? Won’t you like the waiter to know what you will be having for diner before you get to the restaurant so it’s already cooked and ready to serve by time you seat down? What if you were told all that information was pulled right from your head and no one else had access to it? Am sure many will be saying by now ...sign me in!!!That my friend is the future of our tech world. So long data abt me could help fasten and enhance my daily living, I see no reason to doubt unless it was shared with other users without my knowledge. It could be very simple for FB to use an interface going forward which advocates for users choosing the adds they desire to see on their pages.",

Good article Cohan!,
The question is what will replace Facebook? There are limited substitutes. Fb will be just fine,
"The real problem is that at least a third of the ad revenue comes from fake accounts, human click plantations, and bots. Insta is even worse, maybe two thirds.Data breach is just the tip of the iceberg. There's so much more deeply disturbing stuff going on that hasn't yet come to light. Zuck is widely detested, and he will be flame broiled by the media when he inevitably testifies publicly on the Hill. FB will be declared a communications utility, regulated into oblivion, and broken up into its component parts.Nothing good is coming to FB for a long, long time. The fuse has been lit, it's the end of an era, so get some popcorn and enjoy the show. This is gonna be fun",
What people are not understanding is that this is not just going to affect Facebook. All social media companies will be eaten up in the wake of this and smaller players will die eventually. Along with this it will bring down generally any company with high valuations and with it bring down the economy. if Facebook as alleged has swayed the election then it will the entire economy with it combined with the trade risks put there. This is just a precursor to what can happen to the market and lot of them will become cheaper from where they are at no matter where it started.,

"Are we still talking about the massive EQUFAX hack?

DESPICABLE customer “disservice”).  This hack was way more potentially damaging to people than this Facebook info misuse scandal....and yet it’s rarely even discussed less than a year later. The Facebook management team is brilliant, and I have no doubt that they will figure out a way to curtail these abuses.  The most important change that needs to happen is for people to somehow wake up and use their heads so that they can filter out the BS that’s always been on the internet (and certain TV “news” networks named after sly mammals who shall remain nameless). People need to THINK before they click, and not spill out every bit off personal info, likes, and dislikes etc. on social media. THATS JUST COMMON SENSE. Can we really blame Facebook for our own stupidity and cluelessness? What irks me is that we have no way to stop companies like Equifax from gleaning way  more potentially damaging information from us in a world that you can’t function in without credit and cards.  Bottom line.. if Equifax can manage to sweep that mess under the carpet, Im sure Facebook will as well.",

Long ACN since Jan 2003,
"I own ACN and it's been good to me. And I'm close enough to what they do to assess that they are a quality consultant/integrator.  However, as far as I know they are in the business of selling ""people time"" and that's not one of these super-scalable businesses based on intangibles (like FB) or even highly scalable businesses based on a consumer tech product (like Apple.)  At today's ""after the fall"" price of $147 ACN's trailing P/E is 26. So I can't help thinking that if and when there is a general reversion to the mean in equity multiples, ACN's will move toward maybe 15-18.  I have no plans to sell, but even after the fall I don't see that ACN is cheap. (And of course I feel the same way about many other quality stocks, so my cash position is high.)",
"Not a bargain but ACN's free cash flow and net worth trends are reassuring, as is their miniscule debt.  All healthy indicators, especially in a high volatility market environment.Dividends growth is strong and consistent.   What's not to like?",
Any sense how much of the margin underperformance was due to “investments made to acquire mission critical skills...”?

"Fully agree.  I have held ACN for over 10 yrs and took an even larger position in Q1 after rebalancing my retirement fund.  Sure lower margins in a competitive landscape is cause for concern but when considering earnings and outlook there was no reason to dump a quality stock on fundamentals.  I believe ACN is unfortunately and unfairly caught up in the wild swings of the tech sector and the DOW. ACN is now positioned very well across industry and the globe, and has a stellar reputation.  As long as their strong reputation holds and their fundamentals remain in the current range I will hold ACN.",

"mmm this is not gentleman-like, but appropriate for plebs.... Deals Are Not Stolen!Today, AEGEAN stole an order from BA, delivering now 50 A320neo ..the so called sub-par new AEDS unproven body..  AEDS now has a backlog of 1,4 Trln. The client ultimately chooses CFM/GE , P&W or RR engines.",
"No surprise, more seats, better engines (GE) plus they can fly all those folks from  CA, China, etc into the islands, then use their puddle jumpers in 2021 or so (when the 787s arrive)",
"Here's why the Hawaiian and American news is important: The 330neo was predicated on assumptions about Boeing's production costs and pricing. If those cost turn out to be lower than Airbus was figuring, that kind of checkmates the 330neo. The Hawaiian and especially the reports about American suggest that Boeing has been able to reduce production costs significantly on the 787 production line.I'd bet the 787 still costs more than a 330-800 neo, but if the price is in the same ballpark, the business case for the Dreamliner is actually better given the lower operating costs. Airlines know fuel is only going to be more expensive in the future, so if there's an advantage for he 787 now, it's only going to grow wider.What this mean is that the page has turned, aluminum wings are history, aluminum fuselages may be history. Airbus made a mistake trying to make the 350 straddle the 777 and 787. It's going to do fine vs the 777 but not dent the 787 -- you can stretch a plane to go bigger, but if you try to go smaller you lose too much efficiency. If the page has turned, then the re-engining of the 330 turns out to have been a mistake. Airbus should have put the development costs into another plastic plane that really competed with the 787. But in the absence of European ""launch aid"" grants, which have gone away because of WTO rulings, Airbus has much more limited resources for R&D. Anyway, Airbus has made some great strategic moves with the 320 and 321 neo. But re-engining the 330 -- looking like a waste of a lot of R&D resources at this point.",
Trade Wars are not  good but failure to have one or the threat of one now and then are essential to credibility in any negotiation!!!!!!!!!!! Trump and crew understand that! Hence Defense grows and better trade deals will be forthcoming!,
"I agree with anil92691.  Unless you're an aerospace engineer, airplane designer, manufacturer, pilot, airline mechanic, or a flight attendant even, ""boeing builds the best airliners on earth"" is simply an opinion.  As a traveler, safety is taken for granted until something goes wrong with the equipment.  Passengers generally care more about comfort and enjoyment while flying.. That's all they really want.  Who produces or sells more airplanes?  Not so much.",
"Every time I'm in an Airbus and during take-off and landing, The plane sounds like it is falling apart!",
"Wait, I thought Trump's tariffs on China was going to mean the end of Boeing because of Chinese retaliation. What happened?",
Boeing is one of the best maker for air plane on earth.,
"Hawaiian is hardly representative of a victory for Airbus over Boeing.HA originally ordered the A350XWB - a larger aircraft than the 787-9 - then switched to the A330-800, the smallest new generation aircraft. Just like the 787-8, there is little to no reason to buy the A330-800 when the unit cost performance of the smaller aircraft is higher than the larger model.  In the case of the 330-800, there is greater range than its larger sibling; the 787-8 does not have more range than the 787-9.More significantly, you have to wonder where HA thinks it is going to fly with an aircraft that has 17 hour legs; while Boeing might be willing to price the 787 low enough to win the order, the bigger issue seems to be that Hawaiian did not know what it wanted with a new generation aircraft several years ago and decided to go to Boeing to look for a better deal. Also, HA is buying Airbus aircraft -which are replacing much of their 767s operating to the US west coast.  As for American, there is little reason why they would have wanted to buy the A330NEO when they already operate 787s; Airbus has just increased the performance of the A330NEO to push well into 787-9 range.  It is optimized for long transatlantic or transpacific flights, not for the 4000 mile flights that American operates to Europe and to deep S. America.",
"The A330neo-800 is often called an orphan, but let's put that into context. SInce it has very high commonality with the -900, there should never be any doubt of availability and price of the spare parts. Secondly, if the residual value is a problem, AIrbus can step in and warrant a certain residual value for a certain age or nr of flight hours, seriously derisking a A330neo-800 purchase. Boeing seems to be very agressive when trying to reduce momentum for the A330neo program, especially the -800. But I do think the A330neo-800 will eventually find its way. As MRTT, a cargo plane, long range low cost low risk high density config. It just needs time, and perhaps a bit more support from Airbus at the risk and pricing side.",
"At the end of the day, everything Airbus builds is sold or to put it another way, it has a backlog of orders and so the steal does not hurt. And the same goes with Boeing.",
Boeing builds the best airliners on earth?????I know you haven't flown on a recent Airbus then.,
"Boeing didn't steal anything! It's called ""the business case.""  Boeing builds not just better but the best airliners on earth! Some times they are a little slow in changing technologies, but they do that also on the value of a system that is making nothing but money for them. If it ain't broken don't change it!!  Last, I am surprised with all your so called wisdom you didn't call this to begin with a year ago. AB builds ""economically substandard aviation systems.""  So lets hear it with regards for the Airbus's latest effort to save some of their low performance non cost effective systems via freighter conversion!  Not going to be economically viable unless the hulls are scrap priced on the secondary market like the -380's are now getting to be!",
"Then there's another thing to consider as well ... I just read last night that Rolls Royce is having the same difficulties with the new Trent 7000 for the A330neo as it is with the 787. A fix isn't expected until sometime after the aircraft is set to be delivered. With no alternate choice of engine, why would anyone order it knowing that ?And, doesn't Hawaiian still have a large order for A321neo's with Airbus ??",
Is it conceivable that Hawaiian and American Airlines are also leaving Airbus to avoid the scorn of President Trump if they had ordered from Airbus? If so it would be very bad news for free markets.,
"What the author didn’t mention about the defections was that Airbus did take United away from a potential 777X order since they are replacing their 777-200’s with the A350. The only reason for optimism still for Boeing for the 777X is that they love the 777-300 and since they are relatively new, Boeing still have a chance to grab a later replacement of these in about 15 years or so.",
"I am looking for an EBRAER announcement soon, which will be a boon to business and the stock through P/E expansion.",
"Price is a consideration, but as share is eroded the price offering by the competition becomes moot. The opportunity window for the A330neo might be waining, and when it really ends the victim will be the A350. Airbus will be forced to discount their primary wide body in an attempt to get back in the conversation. Using the A330neo to drive price down at Boeing forces an overall downward movement for the entire space, and the loser is the industry. I never understood why Airbus did the A330neo because the life expectancies of wide bodies are finite. When they end, they should be allowed to end gracefully. The A330 had a LONG run, and Airbus benefited. Now, you are killing the space. RR can’t produce the engines, impacting the A350 and 787, and the overall supply chain will have other shortcomings. Stop it Airbus, let the A330neo die so you can get the A350 competitive.",
I'm very intrigued by BA and their business going forward. I want to start a small position (about 20 shares) and was wondering if the current price is a good entry point. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.,
"Dhierin Bechai,Is EADSY a good long term investment? Thanks",
Many good points and price is very relevant. AB can rarely compete fairly.BA on this dip is great add.,
"I am glad to hear this amidst the recent downturn in BA’s stock price. With the fear of a trade war looming large, any additional sales can help the perception that BA is the aircraft manufacturer to own.Hopefully the orders already on the books for the 787 will not be deferred over taxation issues. Personally, I am hopeful that with the increase in world air travel, the future looks bright for both Airbus and BA.On a related note,  the increase in the middle class in China  will require more planes ASAP to match the demand. The increase in air travel from this new group as I have heard will be considerable.Orders are one thing, but producing aircraft is another. As the airline manufacturer only gets paid on delivery, the slow process of manufacturing such complex machines makes it imperative that there are not only sufficient numbers of skilled workers but facilities that can punch these great planes out quickly to high standard. As such China will need to order from both competitor manufacturers to get the planes they require faster despite the looming Trump trade war since any one company, Airbus, or Boeing alone cannot fulfill the required aircraft. There must be a split in orders, all things being equal, like Turkish Air has done to insure the quickest deliveries.",
"Add the latest noise that American is also making a change from Airbus to Boeing for wide bodies (mostly it seems to keep their fleet consistent), and it does make Boeing's 787 look good.  It looks more and more like it is Airbus owning the single aisle market with Boeing picking up the leftovers, and visa versa on the wide bodies.  Lucky for both, there are plenty of leftovers.",

"I'm excited that I will be able to fly Hawaiian Airlines again some time in the future. I was forced to stop flying them for two reasons: all of their flights to Hawaii from my home airport were switched from Boeing to Airbus airplanes, and to protest their order of Airbus A320 airplanes.It could be a while before I can fly them again though because these beautiful 787 airplanes will likely be used on new routes or on their longest distance routes.",

Until then the auto makers have to make most cars so that they can sell in most states.  If Trump does something Draconian to take away states rights that Republicans are always so fond of, he will throw the Senate and House into Democrat's hands.  Believe it or not most people are actually in favor of clean air, both parties have to breathe.  Curiously it appears to be the fossil fuel industry and not the auto makers themselves that trying to roll back EPA mandates, which is an indication to  me that even the auto makers see the writing on the wall.

It is intellectual property, you know the stuff that boosts productivity and makes us wealthier. I have dealt with Chinese companies who did zero R&D in China. Their R&D is in the US, Canada and places like Switzerland and staffed by westerners. You probably don't know there are Chinese vehicles being designed in LA. Intellectual property theft is an art form in China. When you have a huge trade surplus you are in a poor position to negotiate. China needs to follow WTO rules, which it does not. It expects everyone else to. The first item is closing part of its steel industry which is a political 3rd rail even in a thugocracy. They have to be forced to reform.",
"Your analysis addresses the Trump antagonistically negative impact on risk, global trade & bank lending.  The chart on bank lending trailing off even with a growing economy was telling.  It is  accurate and speaks volumes about what banks are doing today.  The responses ignore the premise of your analysis, and simply go down the dangerous dirt road to ""Trump has a plan, no one else in the last 50 years had a plan, let's go with his plan, and why don't you stop attacking the stable genius and his ""plan."".  The tariffs on steel and aluminum were designed for one reason only, to win a narrow congressional district in PA.  That district was the heart of the steel industry 50 years ago, and the residents are still sore.  The United Steelworkers Union & a steel industry hell bent on profits rather than innovation destroyed the American steel industry.  Not Mexico, Canada or least of all China (less than 2% of US steel & aluminum imports).  As soon as the election was lost, Trump lifted the tariffs on Canada, Mexico, Brazil & the EU, so what was his ""plan"" afterall?  Trump's political ploy didn't work.  It might have succeeded had he not travelled to the district the Sunday before the election and delivered a 1.5 hour unscripted tirade against everything that popped into his mind by the minute.  He was a ranting, raving, sometimes comical lunatic, and that speech lost votes in an extremely narrow election.  A moderate neophyte was elected over the 25 year Republican establishment candidate.  My only suggestion, in future articles provide your quality analysis; don't mention Trump; and speak to truth.  You won't antagonize his core, who honestly couldn't understand what your saying anyway because they can't get past the word ""trump.""",

"Trumps methods are disruptive to the market because they create uncertainty in the market. I guess we will see in the long run but I for one would like to see the grandstanding of the POTUS left out and get down to the serious business of resolution. Yes change is needed in our dealing with other countries to create a more level playing field but this not as simple as Trump would put forward. Although I voted for Trump I am surprised that he apparently cannot adapt from  a single handily run business to the business of leading(not running) our Country.We all know his style and as we ( the retail investors) have found out it is not nice to upset and make Mr./Mrs. Market nervous.

"""For Trump to threaten to disrupt global supply lines with punitive tariffs on this basis is worrying.""Have you ever thought that the tariffs aren't intended to be punitive and the intention goes beyond the ""expectations in one of his core constituencies that he is going to deliver a markedly improved jobs outlook,"" but rather as leverage to address the import taxes that keep many American-made products from entering countries such as China?China, along with most other nations, imposes many import taxes on products. A Jeep that may cost about 40 grand here would cost about 70 grand in China.  To suggest that we should just let well-enough alone, regardless of how unfair the current environment may be is what is worrisome.

"It is my belief in 22 months Steve Wynn will purchase his own casino which will be privately owned, and never again depend upon public scrutiny.  Dont think it will be in Japan, but a 3 Bn casino will not be out of the realm of reality.  Maybe he will purchase the 13 Hotel in Macau and change it to the Steven and arrange a deal with a casino operator to use the license to have gaming tables. The cost for that 200 villa  room casino would be 800 MM to purchase 100% ownership, a casino that cost over a $1.3 Bn to build and still is seeking monies. 50 cents on the dollar to purchase this facility.Dont you think many of the people who go to the Wynn will spend their time at the Steven? He could finance 50% of the deal and within two years recuperate his investment. SAW could look for opportunities like this and create growth overseas and have his casino without the scrutiny of the the MEtOO# group",
Steve Wynn was a visionary who needed someone to rein him in from time to time. He spent $7 million on his office once. What you don't want is to replace him with a bean counter who destroys the brand. Wynne casinos have to be absolute first class. It takes a special CEO and hopefully they will find one.,
"I doubt steve Wynn wants to go out like he has demonstrated by resigning as ceo and selling all his Wynn Corp shares. Sure, he has 2 billion bucks and can ride off into the sunset and enjoy retirement. That’s not the ceo Wynn I know. Unless these accusations have tottaly devastated him, I think he wants to restore his reputation and get back into the gaming action. He has much to offer with his creativity and keen mind.. there are many challenging opportunities out there that I think he would relish.",

The P/C police and the effect /costs due to Board of Directors.Finally will Galaxy invest in only as a passive investor with no intent. Would Galaxy spend $25 -27Bn to take out all the shares.Macau Wynn is worth $20 Bn, based on 2018 projected revenues for Wynn Macau $5 Billion and the EBITDA of $1.8 Bn plus the license + 75% of the Long Term DebtWynn USA is worth presently $6 Bn based on 2018 projected $2 Bn with an Ebitda of 600 MM, with potential growth based on Wynn West, Paradise Park and Boston Harbor. I think Galaxy's interest in Wynn Macau is immense, but Wynn Las Vegas will be sold to a separate buyer with Wynn Boston as a part of the package of sold off to another casino operator.As a sell off, the value of Wynn Resort is greater as individual parts , possibly $250 to $260 a share.

There is no alternative way if producing primary aluminum so the competition for the supply of low sulfur petcoke is heating up. Furthermore when the IMO  MAPOL IV rule goes into effect 1/1/2020 and the sulfur content max of bunker fuel drops from 3.5% to 0.5%, the low sulfur residual oil that had been going to cokers today (because it currently is valued less than crude oil) will suddenly increase in value and eliminate the coking incentives for many refineries further reducing supply.

If OPEC can try and control some kind of production figures, I figure the various hurting shipping companies could talk to each other and work out some kind of arrangement about how to up-date their fleets, but not put themselves out of business doing it.    Any ideas.  Peace and thanks",

Thanks for a great article. I've been long NVO and EMIS for years now based on the rising levels of obesity and diabetes. These problems are not going away soon. Somehow NVO has made headway into the weight loss medication space which is good although I would be wary of getting overly optimistic. Obesity is a very difficult problem to address and the results of these drugs are good but not earth shattering. From the results posted here it looks like most patients only lost 5% of their body weight while some lost as much as 13.8%. These results are good and better than other meds but not life changing.,

"Is an OEM allowed to give both AMD and Nvidia their own separate gaming lines, or is an OEM prevented from describing AMD GPU cards as being for gaming?  Recent actions make the latter seem more likely.  AMD GPU Add-In PC board products are specifically designed for gaming and universally ranked against Nvidia by media reports of gaming benchmarks.  Being prevented from offering AMD GPU's as for gaming would seem a serious intrusion into AMD's marketing rights.  A reasonable response might be for AMD marketing to add ""Gaming"" to every GPU product title, then to not service OEM's who are unwilling to use that correct title.  An example GPU title might be: ""Gaming Radeon RX 580.""  By ""not service"" AMD would follow Nvida in not providing example designs, or early parts, or any information at all until part release, including CPU's and APU's.

"AMD publicly states that they think crypto is NOT a sustainable dependable market.  NVDA is making and selling as many high end GPU as possible to feed the miners.  AMD cards are much cheaper than NVDA cards so miners are emptying the shelves of AMD GPU for the cost savings.  What does this mean in Sighco speak?  NVDA will sell as many high margin GPU as possible and use the profits to exist if and when crypto crashes, and there is a glut of used GPU cards.  AMD wants to keep their manufactures happy now and in the future, so AMD is ignoring the high demand from crypto and selling GPU to their corporate clients.  This action by AMD bothers NVDA so they retaliate by creating the partnership agreement which undercuts AMD business model to strengthen corporate relationships.  NVDA wants to have their cake and eat it also.  :Problem for AMD is the time it is going to take for the lawyers to get rich off this anti trust action.  AMD needs profits now.

"I sent this e-mail to Mr. Bennett on March 9, and have not heard back. Nor has AMD contacted me.  Where community of experts are excluded from independent assessment . . . ""Kyle, contact me and we can have a chat on the differences between MDF v exclusive dealing and monopoly bridging v 2 step and 3 step tied charge systems like Intel Inside.""On exclusive dealing stand the only Nvidia GPU tie is to volume scale; dGPU and/or combined with iGPU in horizontal sales bundle. Or, vertical tie with Tegra that is a far less potent 15 USC 2 violation in relation to the vertical x86 CPU to dGPU and/or jGPU tie. Another question concerns how Intel share affects Nvidia and AMD share positions that are diminutive in iGPU v Intel.There are two questions; 1) Nvidia monopoly volume share, and 2) incentives tied to monopoly volume creating a sales channel incentive to sell one brand over the other due to the brand reward incentive acting as overriding channel commission; Intel Inside for example.Literally think of this as a water tank up high gravity feeding components down channels tied to their channel attracting and competitor discriminating sales incentives.Incorporates the question of del credere broker dealership where one lateral of the supply chain over procures for component purchase incentives tied to that overage with 100% of incentives pocketed, where any remaining component overage is brokered off to another lateral of the supply chain sans incentives distorting the have and have not sales potential. Del credere practice like the water tank example creates original procurement pool of rebates that attract to tie channels vertically, and horizontally by vertically, to pull the primary OEM's integrated product through channels on monopolization of the original OEM/IDM purchase incentives now incorporated into the integrated product (Intel Inside again) when and where those incentives are relied and tied to end buyer direct and retail channel end purchase outlets. Practice is especially destructive when incentives stripped from prior generation including procured overage are applied as spring board against and to launch a next generation product that is one form of bridging. The above become a 15 USC 1 price fix violation where one horizontal lateral of OEMs for example are tied vertically to channel sales outlets in either 2 step or 3 step system when operated as a closed financial circle, including relied for registered metering of discharged channel inventory holding's by the original incenting manufacturer. This is the juxtaposed dealing combination example. In the 3 step system the original component design producer matches the integrating OEM payment to channels.  In 2 step system original component producer passes the incentive through the OEM. Or  the OEM pays the incentive to end sales outlet that is not a violation.If the passing of incentives does not touch each member of the design producer supplier chain it's likely not an antitrust violation. If it looks like a franchisor / franchisee MDF program its ok.Until I actually review Nvidia GeForce program guide I'm writing off the HardOCP report as a system manipulation or press confusion.Mike Bruzzone, Camp MarketingImplicit threat of impairing access and allocation are different from exclusive dealing, del credere dealership, bridging, the closed 4 step and potentially limiting 2 step system.

And both intel & nvidia are doubling down on their efforts as AMD is taking market share from both.

If Nvidia wants to establish a new line of branding with OEMs than that's fine. But forcing well known established brands to go Nvidia exclusively or else they will crush early access to their hardware or having a lower amount of GPU allotment is anti-consumer.,
"The GPP is a branding partnership. Of course NVIDIA wants to incentivize their board partners to separate cards based on NVIDIA's GPUs and those based on AMD's GPUs into different brands. The point of the program, from NVIDIA's perspective, is so they can ensure the quality of the offering. NVIDIA and the board partner work together to build a strong brand that becomes known for high quality. Now, regarding AMD also having GPUs in this brand: 1) AMD would be piggybacking on the work that NVIDIA and the board partner are doing through the program if their GPUs are are also sold through the brand, and 2) the AMD GPUs are not something that NVIDIA have control over, so if there is a quality issue associated with them NVIDIA cannot help, but the quality issue will reflect badly on the brand that NVIDIA and the board partner are working together to create.I think the above two problems are pretty obvious. So, what is the solution then for NVIDIA and the participating board partners? It is to separate the gaming brands of the board partners into NVIDIA exclusive brands and some other brand. Since NVIDIA have at least 80% (more like 90%) of the gaming enthusiast market, the board partner is naturally going to choose to place NVIDIA's GPUs into its established gaming brand and either create a new gaming brand for AMD GPUs (something it seems to be allowed to do under the terms of the GPP but which HardOCP incorrectly speculated that it cannot), or to just not bother marketing AMD GPUs in a gaming brand because the cost associated with it isn't worth the revenue that AMD GPUs alone provide. That decision is the board partner's choice and is based on pretty obvious economics.Would you argue that McDonald's should allow restaurants that purchase their products to sometimes put a McDonald's hamburger in a Big Mac and sometimes put a White Castle hamburger in it? From the way it looks (I don't know what the actual agreement is), McDonald's demands restaurants that sell McDonald's products sign a franchise agreement and sell exclusively McDonald's products. In the graphics card market they don't go so far as to create franchises, but that doesn't mean that branding isn't important or doesn't affect GPU manufacturers' sales. Just like McDonald's can demand a restaurant become a franchise and exclusively sell McDonald's products if they wish to sell any McDonald's products at all, I am sure NVIDIA could do something similar with a board partner. I don't see why there would be a legal problem with such an arrangement unless NVIDIA snapped up all or almost all the board partners and didn't allow any of them to sell AMD products. That would be a monopolistic abuse of market power. But NVIDIA aren't doing that. They aren't even demanding exclusivity of products by the board partner. They are only demanding separate branding.",
"We'll see if anything comes of this. I think it is silly to say I am Long NVDA and not AMD... or vise versa.  Both have great businesses. NVDA is not scared. I do not know why people say this.

Couldn't MSI have decided to keep their Gaming X brand as AMD-specific, and then create a new one for Nvidia?  Or isn't it equally applicable that Dell decides to make an AMD chip the default GPU in the XPS 13, and because of the terms from Nvidia, it ""would be far more difficult for Dell to create an alternative XPS brand just so they can sell an [Nvidia] based computer?""   Could it just be that Nvidia, as it pushes more out into the direct retail consumer space with products like Shield and GeForce Now, and as the gaming base broadens & therefore becomes less ""hardcore/knowledgeable, just wants a clearer brand identity for itself also in products that it is an OEM supplier for?",

Gaining market share isn't why every company in the world tries to attain a significant position of power...other companies play the one-ups-manship game for, uh, for altruism!  Yeah, dat's it, for dat altruism stuff.Attaining a significant position of power is the consequence of delivering beyond customer expectations.  Far from impeding customer options, it is the very RESULT of superlative delivery of superior customer options.  The motivation to strive mightily in the one-ups-manship game is the entire reason free enterprise is the preferred system--the result is superior product for the end user. Attempting to make some kind of ethical case out of it is not likely to help the company you hope makes a comeback, I have to tell you. My personal opinions....",

Nothing wrong with GPP.  AMD is welcome to setup a similar program of their own.  This is a cross promotional marketing program and a brilliant idea from the green team.  Why should AMD benefit from Nvidia’s marketing efforts?,

"Thanks Ted but remember you reinforced that in me over a year ago. If I wavered it was my fault. I have seen too many immature hunting dogs get side tracked from the scent and lost their game chasing chipmunks instead of rabbits... I guess it also comes down to when I started they said buy this and don't look back. Didn't work that way, the sector was changing so fast. Maybe like alot of us that started following so close we just got off the scent or got tired. I learned a lot of my business acumen from the Jews. They had a saying, Know your position, even if it STINKS!!! In other words if your head is stuck somewhere where your not getting fresh air, pull it out and get back on track... I Thought Canopy was a top leader and am convinced that Sunniva is going to be their Counterpart. I could chase my tail all day but I guess, I am smelling the fresh air again and do not intend to get side tracked. If I am wrong, hey like we said in NAM, guess what, we woke up this morning!!!!! About US Native Americans ,I went to a Reservation School and no prejudice but they do have a completely different game here as depending on the TREATIES they have their own Nation so do not face the obstacles yours may have in Canada. My only mention is don't muddy up the water because you think you came late to the party. Jump in and enjoy the water...",
"What a diverse group today. I am going to be like the monkey but instead of the jungle it's the FARM. First , Mebarret2, The Native American thing is a completely different animal in Northern Wisconsin and different tribes. Those that have TREATY RIGHTS are pretty much a Nation unto them selves. They pretty much govern themselves and do  not have to adhere to many of the Federal rules or regulations. They intend to start producing cbd this fall as they made the Governor  declare it illegal, then they can exercise their treaty rights to do as they please on tribal lands. Why do you think their Casinos do so well. Vegas is federally regulated on percentage of pay outs, tribal casinos can set their own percentage. As far as position I am pretty much in line with Or. I am making my life real simple. I think unless your in for the long haul and have the funds the best thing for me is to take my best of the best  and move on. I have taking Sunniva as my US play and Canopy as my Canada play and dumped the rest. I have confidence in both and that's all I need. Yes there is a real question of if everybody jumps on the band wagon and takes money around legislation, how long before it builds back . Does anybody see either of these TITANS as long term? I learned a lesson with SHOPIFY. Got in at  $89.00, watched it grow to $120.00 held and the bottom dropped out on bad press. The company didn't change. I did not take $40,000 and it vanished, I road it out, it climbed back to $159.00 and I got out. I still believed in the company but got caught up in Sunniva. I should have watched the company as, like sunniva, there are winners, they went down because of so much selling and I could have bought back at $95. Before I even gave it a thought I noticed an article on them and looked at it. They were right back at $147.00 in the blink of an eye. I now see my error as I believed in them but got caught up in the Cannabis fever and shot myself in the foot. I believe they will see $180.00 in a short term and will only grow from there so now regardless of what comes along, they have proven they can beat all odds. I feel this way about Canopy and Sunniva  and do not intend to repeat that mistake. I am sure there are great small plays out there but alot of money and time is needed to make it happen.Long winded but I guess I won't be as active on the posts because I have laid my money down now time for  me to wait it out...",

"I don't think saying that returns have averaged 70% over the last 4 years captures the experience of those living through those years holding MJ stocks.   There were a couple of huge rallies (2014, Nov 2016, Nov '17 -Jan '18) followed by huge sell offs, sometimes retracing more than 95% of initial share prices.  This suggests me that one has to be very careful about timing and about selling into rallies to accumulate profits that can be invested again later.Take a stock like Namaste.  I bought it for $0.19 after reading Ted's articles, and sold all the way up to $3.00.   If I just held it I would have lost 50% from the peak, so it is important to sell on the way up and then to buy back stocks that are cheap.  The tricky part is to know how much to sell at what prices.   It would have been easy to sell all of Namaste after it doubled, but then one would have missed the next 1400 percent increase that followed doubling.To me the best strategy is to accumulate stock, particularly on dips like we had this past couple of months, and then sell by increments into any rallies over the next few months into the summer.  The logical transition would be to take profits from Canada during the legalization process and invest them in the US as we get closer to our own legalization.  This is just my opinion, but I think many others also are thinking this way.",
"So the average annual increase for stocks in the sector has been around 70% over the last 4 years. I really don't see a reason to suspect the next 4 years will be any worse. We're in a bit of a bear market right now, and bears can't see the forest for the trees. But very soon market sentiment will shift once again, as it always does, and we'll see things differently. One year from now, all of the napkin math predictions will come true (or not) and that's when the real fun will begin.",
"Also, I know a lot of retail investors have been scared away with the recent sp movement. However, I think as it becomes apparently imminent that Canada will legalize recreational use the wary will start making their way back in fear of missing out. While it is apparent to all/most of us that the Canadian legalization vote will be successful, I don't think the same can be said for a big portion of first time investors who piled into the green rush in Jan and then sold lower afterward in fear of losing everything.",

Any concerns about senate issues causing share prices to drop further just prior to June 7? Apparently the Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples is recommending amending the bill to delay it for changes and further consultation. http://bit.ly/2I6XsOwThis could be one of many issues that might make the market nervous.,
I agree with Oak.  My number is similar and I am only taking a small percentage of profits at that time.  You want to at least give yourself a chance for something special to happen or it will never happen.  Remember to use a limit sell and let the price come to you when it is rising.  Good luck.,
"Agreed, prices have already taken quite a beating across the board.  Every single cannabis stock is but a short dip away from revisiting their pre-January bottom.I think that the next week or two should continue to see a choppy trend down a bit. My gut feeling is that by the third week of May we will start seeing the pre-legalization hype take shape. Maybe a few days to a week+ after the June 7th vote, we'll potentially see new 3 month highs before there is some profit taking across the sector.",
"Those assumptions are outdated... prices have already gone down. Ted's prediction was that we will see a consistent, albeit choppy, climb upwards all the way to legalization, which would represent the peak because ""what is there to look forward to after that"". Instead, what we've had over the last 3-4 months was a consistent, albeit choppy, downward trend. And now we already see what the next big prize is going to be, just beyond the horizon: US federal de-scheduling, followed, perhaps, by US federal legalization. So June will not be the peak, both because we will still be some distance away from the January highs, and because there will still be positive momentum to carry us forward. Me personally, I am not going to consider selling anything before Sunniva hits $15.",
"Legalization is June 8th, stock prices are likely to rise before of just after legalization.  I realize that LP’s will not be able to sell immediately but the media buzz will occur.   I would not sell until the stock rises due to legalization.  There is a significant “event” in front of us that is going to happen.  My thoughts are to at least wait and see the results of this “event”.......You can decide to hold based on the long term expectations for Sunniva, which I think are great, based on your own views.",
"Shareholders might be too focused on the outcome of the financing arrangements and rightfully so. From my, average Joe view, one of the two things would happen. Either they will finance via debt or more dillution (or a  combo). Worst case, more shares, yet SNN alive and is moving forward still having comparatively low number of outstanding shares vs many other players. I realize my simplified approach to the above situation, but again, I wont be loosing sleep over it.  And sure, would be nice to see all coming together as planned.Where I am loosing sleep is the coming months and a bigger picture for all of the MJ holdings. Last I remember, on Ted's chart, we were in the ""trading phase"", after which I believe I saw a downtrend with the scary ""BEARS"" written on it. A million dollar question: ""When shall we sell"" ? Should've listened to my friend and bought ""V"" lol :)",
"I feel badly for all those who bought at higher prices, but not everyone is in your boat. There are a lot of shares that are going to leak into the market because of warrants, options and especially convertible notes at prices way below the current price.",
"It comes down to whether we think they can execute their plan, and whether we believe the repeated and clear (albeit unofficial) statements that the private loan for BC will happen.  I think how you view sunniva at this stage depends on whether you're the kind of investor who will take a measured risk based on strong management and a solid plan, and trust your own judgement on management's credibility and competency, and think their steps so far have been reasonable (Ted's style) or whether you're someone who wants to see more concrete proof and progress before jumping into something (which seems to be Alan's style based on his comments here). Both are valid investment approaches but they are different styles. A lot of us here are comfortable going out on a limb for a company with strong management + plan, and we trust our own and Ted's judgement on that. But the risk/benefit balance of being early investors (and we're very early on sunniva) is that we'll have to be patient as the plan unfolds, and live with the more conservative investors chiming in that nothing's proven yet - which is the very nature of an early venture with higher risk/reward. Some things are out of SNN's control (like the site contamination at OK Falls) so there are always risks. And I don't think we're necessarily clear of share dilution if SNN wants to augment its original plan by expanding aggressively in California (that's just my guess - but even that would be a trade-off which would hopefully make them stronger). For me, their plan and management are strong enough that I have faith this will be a solid company in the future - and whatever happens between here and success will simply be a delay - delay is really our worst-case scenario. It's frustrating for those of us that bought in over $9 Cdn for sure, but I don't feel uneasy.",
some cognitive dissonance after reading these recent comments,
"Appreciate your view, Alan. Personally, I don't think they are in a position to finalize any financing agreement before they have selected the site location and received the necessary permits. So it looks like a statement like ""we're in talks with lenders and funds"" is the best we can hope for at this point. No serious lender could make a formal commitment before the company concludes its own DD process and before the approval process is complete.",
"So, here we are, 25 days since I posted ""Who will lend them that much? Only convertible debt at a big discount. I remain cautious on this name - all story, no action so far."", and there is still no answer. They are in talks only still. I continue to believe that debt financing is extremely unrealistic and that having U.S. operations muddies the story significantly. Why isn't Canopy Growth issuing $60 million of senior debt and $40 million of junior subordinated debt? Perhaps because the market isn't quite there yet.This stock trades at a big premium to the value of its net assets and isn't anywhere close to cranking out big revenue from cannabis sales. Clinics are not valued very highly - look at Aleafia or National Access, for example, so it would be a mistake, in  my view, to layer on a lot of valuation for the current business. The situation I see is that the company is short the money to pay for the dream they are selling to retail stock investors, and lots of dilutive securities are deep in the money and will cause pressure on the stock.Again, nothing at all wrong with the company necessarily except the stock price, in my view, and if they prove me wrong and raise all that debt capital, well kudos to them.",
"Pretty disappointing call. I don't short stocks (or trade cannabis stocks personally), but after hearing this, I would like to be short this stock. Still banking on unrealistic assumptions. These kinds of projects should most definitely NOT be financed with debt. Crazy in my view.",

Construction is virtually complete and work has commenced in the internal infrastructure. Propagation is expected in June/July with the first harvest in September/October.(2) Recent receipt of California temporary licenses validates SNN’s business model and their expectation that the differences between this model and 100% ownership and operation in the first five years will be insignificant.(3) Test production of oils has commenced and the early results are excellent. This has stimulated interest among third party growers who are considering using Sunniva to produce oils for them.(4) Due to delays in processing paperwork in Oliver, SNN has been forced to consider alternative sites. A site at Okanagan Falls, B.C. is being considered. SNN is ready to break ground immediately.(5) Natural Health Services continues to grow. Patient requests exceed NHS doctor’s ability to provide assessments. NHS has captured approximately 25% to 30% market share based on Health Canadanumbers for total patients.(6) Recent political developments in the U.S. have made SNN even more optimistic and aggressive growth will be pursued including an acquisition strategy.""FULL INTERVIEW IN THE LTB NEWSLETTER!

"Back to 6.66....sorry, I will stop now.  I am curious to see what the acquisitions are.  My guess is dispensaries in Southern California to match the Canadian model of NHS.  This is pure speculation.",
Interesting....here Im trying to buy 1000 shares of Sunniva and TD bank gives the message: Your qty order is higher that the number currently offered for sale.,
"Did anyone see this article?http://bit.ly/2vJHGErInteresting speculation... I noticed too, how the share price quickly spiked - mostly in the last 10 minutes before yesterday's market close.",
Was delayed til April 30,
anyone see sunniva quarterly year end reports? judging from the price drop this morning it must not have been so good?,
"Ted, can you point out where the blog post on lexaria is? I didn’t even realize SA had a blog but I’m also using the phone app and not the website.  Also, why is sunniva just posing 12/31 earnings now? Doesn’t that seem a bit late?",
@Ted I don’t see your blog post on Lexaria,
"looks like news from Sunniva is coming out very soon from the way the market action was towards closing today. Hopefully some good surprises ! nice to have you back Ted. please do keep us posted if you decide to start a new social media page or news chat , cheers",
"Nice hearing from you Peel, your an odd duck but loveable. You have the breeding of a liberal but somtimes act like a conservative. I think money has a way of altering judgement. Yes all groups seem to have too many Chiefs and not enough Indians. When I first joined the board  the County Chairmasn told me, ""We make the decisions for the people as they really don't want to make the hard choices just complain about them"". Those words are so true. Not to talk Politics but Pompeo going to Korea and nobody knowing about it till he got back was the correct call. If I stopped to ask every person how to run my company, I would never get anything done and my competitor would always Know my next move. This is one reason why I base so many of my desicions on Management. Canaopy was one. They can trash Linton all they want but as they said in the movie, ""SHOW ME THE MONEY"". I feel the same about Sunniva, everyone was running around playing ""the sky is falling, the sky is falling"" where is TED. Guess what Dr. Holler was't hiding in a bunker dodging falling pieces. He  and his group know what they are doing and where they are headed. US is a big Ocean but at this point I like ya but I aint going Kayaking with you in those uncharted waters. Maybe I may miss an early jump with this mentality but I have my plate full with what I have designated for my timetable. Hell 20 years ago, I may have bouncing around like a a rubber ball also but now content to make some good short term gains, enjoy the sunshine and regroup at some point.... As far as sticking on the $6.66 mark for sunniva, I am not that concerned as I look at my overalll gains and loses and they stay about in relation to that type of range. A little here, then a little there. I think we are going to see this for some time before the train leaves the station, right now people are just checking boarding passes and seating and waiting for departure. No tea leaves in the cup or Omens here.....",
This stock really likes the price 6.66.   It could be its natural frequency.,
"Rigbo - thanks for the vent and tale. You remind me of Lincoln, who was the finest yarn teller and it led him to the presidency. (Lincoln - Team of Rivals). You are right up there and i enjoy your posts, greatly. I used to work with non profits here in CA. If you think the public sector can be slow and frustrating, try non profits. Well intentioned but often too ""democratic"" in the sense that everyone in the organization often has a vote or too many sub committees have to be set up to make all decisions agonizingly slow. I, too, am long SNN but I feel it will be sooner, rather than later. I think with its strong focus on California and recent comments by Holler to put more attention here in the state, I think we'll see more upside to the company and stock soon. And, it is a huge market. But, yes, waiting for other US stocks, will be longer.  And i hear the suffragette movement here is moving ahead quickly.....",
"Oak Or, plenty of info thanks. TED, HI. Having been a County Board Commisioner years ago and being on the zoning committee, I realize the problems associated with our system. I jumped ship years ago and it has only gotten worse. One reason why we have lost so much businees to over seas and other countries. My original  investing ideas  were geared for infrustucter but most companies can't afford the timelines. Another subject!!! Anyway as one of the fairly new posters pointed out ""some of us old guys "" are hung up on Canada and should be looking at the US. Wow, like a bad dream. I remember the last year of so many ups and downs and to me the key word regarding the US, is ""SOMEDAY"". Every thing is geard to maybe, could be, lots of potential, etc. We in the States have experienced too many "" maybes"" that it is not in my time frame. I went throught he roller coaster ride of Canada and they are on track. Are they going to be the leader for ever, probably not but I am assuming people investing know which train is leaving the station at what time and mapped some routing and know when it's time to switch trains or mode of transportation to arrive at their destination. I will stick with my Canada plays and will long Sunniva until the ""SOMEDAY"" comes along. In the US we are almost looking at another election and can't get past the trivia of the first one. Add to that the inability to get anybody to agree on anything in a timely manner is too much drama for me.... Well, all that venting helped nobody but me but that's ok.........",
"OK FINE! Since nobody at all asked for it, here is Laureen M Heisler's post from the facebook group:""Info from the Sunniva Inc. Public Open House Information Session April 23,2018 at Okanagan Falls Seniors Centre.The presentation was given by Duncan Gordon / Chief Operating Office of Sunniva Inc. The following are from my notes I took at the open house.Sunniva currently has a development proposal plan for the old Weyerhaeuser property at 1655 Maple Street, Okanagan Falls(OK Falls), BC and a development proposal plan for the Senkulmen Business Park on the Osoyoos Indian Band (OIB) in Oliver, B.C. Duncan mentioned that whichever property they receive approvals for first, will be the property that they develop. At present, the process in obtaining approvals from the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen (RDOS) for the OK Falls property is further ahead than is from the OIB property. Any development on OIB land requires Government involvement, which has slowed down the progress in Oliver. Therefore, Sunniva is going ahead with the OK Falls development.Sunniva development in Okanagan Falls, BCDuncan confirmed for me that the facility will be funded by Bank and Subordinate Debt Financing. Sunniva does have a Financing Partner but Duncan would not tell me who the Partner is/are, he just smiled. I said, “you’re not going to tell me, are you?”. He just smiled again. I asked Duncan what the timeline for licensing and financing is, but all he would offer is that it is in the works and that there is an order in the process that takes place for the licensing and financing.[[ Edited to include the following: Sunniva will be purchasing the property from Weyerhaeuser. ]]The ground testing that began last week on the site, continued today. The property has contamination and requires clean up and the removal of derelict building structures. As no permit is required for grading the site, Sunniva will be breaking ground this week with plans to begin grading next week (the week of April 30 – May 04).Sunniva is currently waiting on Development and Building permits from the RDOS. The representative from the RDOS that was at the open house indicated that approvals/permits could besometime within May. (Mark Stewart, please correct me if I got the timeline wrong).In addition, Sunniva will be required to do an ecological study and a traffic study as well as upgrades to the existing Weyerhaeuser road.Once all permits have been issued and building construction begins on the first greenhouse facility, the timeframe for completion of the build is anticipated to be between 3 to 4 months. The construction on the second greenhouse facility is anticipated to begin between 18 months to 2 years after completion of the first facility.Sunniva estimates that there will be 240 full time jobs and no temporary jobs. First greenhouse is estimated to employ 150 people and the second greenhouse is estimated to employ 90 people.The greenhouses will have odor control. No air exhaust from the cultivation zones. A small volume of air exhaust will be from the roof vents and chiller house but not the cultivation zones. Carbon cassette filters or UV light and high-pressure mist lines will be applying non-irritating enviro-friendly odor control.They will have an incinerator on site (a Health Canada requirement) to burn the waste (stems, roots etc.)The greenhouses will have black out screens to prevent light escape. The green house operations will be from 8 AM to 5 PM Monday to Friday.Water will come from rain water off the roofs of the building and fed into a recovery pond as well as from wells.Around the perimeter of the property will be landscaping that will help make the facility blend in more with the surrounding landscapes. The Office building glass will be imprinted with a picture of the Peach Cliff mountain that will be in the background of the facility looking north.When the facility is complete Sunniva plans on planting a crop every single week.There were a lot of questions asked of Duncan by the local residents. After the presentation and Q&A’s, the residents my husband and I spoke with were in favour. I am guessing that there were some not in favour, but we hadn’t spoken with any of them.""",

"Budapest, Nice to see your name pop up also, like Oak a solid poster. I had several people comment on Dr. Holler's video as to the appearance of his desk and interview style. Hey, some of the most intelligent people I know have a work environment that resembles a war zone myself included. I wonder how i survive without loosing the enevlopes or scrap of paper I made my notes on.  Slick Willy and tailored suits are fine but give me the real meal deal any day. He surely doesn't need to sell himself. Another sign of mental agility, watch his face and eyes. He already has the answer before the interviewer has said 3 words.... As far as US plays, alot of hype going to be coming along but I believe I will stick with Sunniva as my only US needed stock. Another reason by the the time US catches up to Canada on the global scene , Sunniva will be strong into branding  running hard with many trying to play catch up and won't know which car to chase, Global, Moat, Branding. It will be Keastone Cops for sure....",

"thanks Oak...that is great to hear.wondering if you or anyone can confirm or deny 2 other things i heard that may give Sunniva or CRON an advantage:1.  something like canadian companies trading on CSE vs Toronto stock exchange have less restrictions in working with US-based companies.2.  i read somewhere that in canada they dont usually use MedMen-type of dispensaries, but rather the cannabis somehow gets directly to the patient.  if true, I am guessing maybe it is a healthcare-related issue and CRON is making the MedMen partnership in anticipation of utilizing the dispensary retail model once adult-use is legalized this summer?appreciate any feedback, thanks!",
"Hi Jason, once Sunniva actually starts cultivating they will have their own brands, and they'll also supply product to numerous other brands both in California and Canada - Tweed is just one example that we know of. So they'll be very much involved in the branding game, and they may end up producing multiple winners in the same way that many alcohol, beverage and tobacco companies, and even apparel manufacturers, sell their product under different names. Even though we probably won't have the full details for several weeks or months, I think Sunniva gets a big check mark in this department.",
"hi guys..active board here, so i thought i would throw a question out.first: i am currently long CRON and SNNVF.   Waiting to purchase MedMen once they list on CSE.i have looked at Canopy and Aurora, but here is my (fairly new and inexperienced) take on how to invest in cannabis.  I am based in US and an adult-use market will be epic and mammoth, imo.  Many of you seem Canadian, so unsure if you watch CNBC or caught that they discussed cannabis stocks all week long on their ""Fast Money"" stock market show.  The US had a ton of positive momentum on cannabis this week, from Trump leaning towards states rights, to senators voicing support for making it legal on federal level.  majority of americans are in favor of legalization and politics follows voter sentiment.  So I think any cannabis investment, for me, should have a US tie-in somewhere to be positioned for that market long-terms.  Sunniva fits that model.  I like CRON due to MadMen partnership.More importantly, I like CRON and MadMen because when it comes to adult use in the future, i think money is made in retail (the brand) vs the commodity of the product itself.i think about giant cigarette and liquor or beer companies, and consumers dont care who makes the ingredients or which is the cheapest...they tend to buy based on brand names and/or perceived quality.Eventually, legal cannabis leaf or oil may be sold in packaged form at regular stores in the future, just as cigarettes and liquor are today.  Brands will matter most then.For short-term, dispensaries will be the retail storefront or brand that consumers see, which is why I keep coming back to MedMen and then to CRON.Any thoughts from this mssg board on CRON or on who has best brand/retail story out there today and potentially in the future?thanks,Jason",

"At 70 and having lived several life times in one, I feel comfortable with the unsuspected. I spent my whole life always one step ahead. My mind was like a computer on steriods as my processing ability was spooky. I always had three plans in place before I even moved on one. One thing I have learned now is that the unsuspected is now a normal. I mean there are a number of reasons we are not hearing from Ted. I guess in reality that is ok as when many of us wandered onto his path we were crawling. I think after a year of guiding and handholding, we should be pretty much walking on our own. Now if you try to reason it out, go in steps. Is TED ill, possiblly not as he would have informed us that he had some personal down time needed. This also goes for any other issues that came up. Did he get the ""WORD"" from somebody to ""back off"" , if so I am sure he would have come up with some lame excuse that he was chasing new bunnies in the field. Is he dead, highly unlikely. It could be as simple as he is mentally testing ""HIS STUDENTS"" on their ability to have retained a certain degree of DD on their own. To come out and state that fact would defeat the purpose. I think we have to understand what makes a guy like TED tick. It's not Money, it's not Fame. I believe he has the heart of a mentor and as such is letting the little Robins find there way out of the nest and like a mother Robin who finds a chick that can't fly right off the bat, she is always close by. Eventually if that young bird doesn't fall prey to something it will fly and join the others on the telephone wire.. Great story huh? Now give it a rest......",

everything ok with Ted? I just read through 185 messages and not one answer from Ted. Hope your doing well and just on vacation somewhere nice!,
Well since sunnvia is tanking hard the last two days( including today) since the announcement of reporting do you guys take that as bad news coming? I’m invested deep into it and starting to worry.  Main concern is how can they supply canopy in q1 if they don’t even have a spot to grow in yet. Plants take anywhere from 3-4 months to grow in its two stages then at least 2 weeks to cure if ur doing it right.  Plus the time for the construction if they’re building from the ground up.  I don’t get it.,

The stock hasn’t made much news lately, only lost 30% of its value. As have others of course. Rigbo, you need my address to send me some steaks? I’ll send you some crystals and granola in exchange. Though after the BIG one here in SF, Omaha could be my backyard??",
"I agree with and have said, Ted as others are not on the posts, as what is there to talk about.  Last year was a real roller coaster ride and much to speculate on and discuss. Now Sunniva was Ted's last big SHOUT. Has anyone seen anything exciting to invest in? Sure there is a lot of noise coming from the US but to me it's a slow train. Canada was fun and fast track, now it is methodical in it's strategy  and just playing out their hand. I guess I am satisfied with my positions, may sell some land and play some more but for now am pretty much a by stander.Peel, I was having a delicious Omaha  steak with Warren yesterday and he was confused about your FORWARD thinking comment.

And yet you guys ask the same questions every day: What's the plan for Cali site? What's the plan for Canada? Are they leasing space to other tenants in their facilities? Are there any new announcements on the way? (He doesn't work for Sunniva's PR department - BTW) Live stream or Google Earth shows a crow flying over Cathedral City site - is it a bad omen? LolBut in all seriousness, I am tired of reading the same questions too. If you guys are regretting this buy, then sell now and move on.

Does anyone know how long radients patent on their map technology is good for?  Thanks,
Provocative question: Do you guys think that Ted's complete silence here and his lack of comment on Sunniva in the latest newsletters indicates a diminished enthusiasm for the company? Maybe something behind the scenes that we don't know about.,
"Now I truly do feel like ""the Old Timer"". You real investors are off into the wild blue of the US. With the exception of Sunniva, I still am strictly Canada. I guess as this is a hobby  I do not have the burning urge to play with the US as really not sure of their  ability to move forward in a timely manner. I had enough fun riding the bucking bronco with Canada so will settle with a few hundred thousand and ride off in the sunset on my John Deere Tractor and play hobby farm. Oh and fish... It's been fun. Good Luck.......Lemon Peel, great idea a few of us get together. I would propose a big party for TED up North. I am leery of the East and West coast. I understand many years ago the earth tilted and half the nuts and bolts ended up on either coast??? Florida is not a good choice unless it's Northern Florida as it is really not a State but a Foreign Country.. Leaves the North, Midwest or Alabama!!!!!",
"Hey Ill Mon, I agree with your assessment of iAnthus and have been accumulating shares (up 20% since last week). The Northeast combined with Florida is an attractive combo with substantial upside.  Players like Fincanna and Cannaroyalty are mainly focused on California, so I see iAnthus as the natural complement to my Sunniva stake.I did see the following video about Cannex recently on the Midas Letter. At first glance, investing in the Washington State cannabis seems pretty stupid given the reported supply glut and falling prices. BUT, being the market leader with cost advantages means that Cannex can generate some serious profits there as competitors drop out of the market. I added a small stake so I can keep an eye on their progress. Could be some nice upside here.VIDEO: Cannex Capital Holdings CEO Anthony Dutton on Being the #1 Cannabis Producer in Washington Statehttp://bit.ly/2vrX3kC",

"Budapest, Oak yeah even you Lemon Peel. Your all starting to feel and sound like old timers. There are a lot of names I don't see any more since I first started over a year ago. I think alot of that is because back then things were different. It was like the wild West. We were all hanging on Ted';s every word and staying in contact on almost a daily basis because so much was happenning. We were all strictly into Canada Canabis because we missed the first go around in the US and things were just not jellying. We were caught up in not so much who was licensed but who was the biggest, who was the cheapest, who had the medical edge , who had the connections, who could produce , who were the winners. It was a daily nip and tuck but finally it became pretty clear. For me it , I parred down from 12 to 6. Canopy, Aurora, Kush, Lxrp, Nxttf and the new kid in town Snnvf. I think you do not hear alot from the old posters as well as Ted as there is no more Wild West show. It is prettty cut and dried from here on in. Who can produce, who can supply, who has global connections , who has medical break throughs and of course the California Kid, a true winner with the current  politics. Now it is a case of ok, where is the Tsunami headed. All the people that want to play long term on medical break throughs and trial stuff is great and maybe a good long term investment. Not my ,  game. I am a 2 year max at this stage, when we move to the next stage I will formulate a new strategy. Right now the money is going  to be fast and furious on the big 3. Now , once everything calms down and this becomes a commodity, we will see who has been bought by pharm or tobacco, or merged, who has the global connections , who has the price advantage, who is the accepted medical  drug, etc. Next comes pricing and branding. We have now moved into the old cigs and alcohol category. What works at what price? Maybe a play in designer drugs will give some yields but little volume. I think you are not hearing alot from Ted or some of the others for the reasons I just stated. We ran hard, played fast and now it's time to see where it's going, once that is defined , we are off to a new game.  COOL.",
"FPEX1000, future dillution possibility is what Ive also heard/read regarding both. But looks like it is inevitable even comparing to the establishment history of the Canadian MJ companies. Look at Canopy, ACB just to name a few. I get the importance of non-dillution model and this is one of the reasons I believe in SNN.LHS (which had a $20M bought out deal today) is getting (got already?) in Massachusetts. Sorry, cant keep up with all the tickers news.EVIO, lab testing MJ, expanding there as well. Ohhh boy, so many players...which one is the rocket?IlliterateMonkey, congrats!!! :)",

"Hi Ted,  This is a bit of a curve ball but legalization in Massachusetts is going to occur in July as well.

"Ted, thanks for the newsletter !",
"While I consider buying more Sunniva to lower my cost (like others I bought a ton at $8.50-11 US when that was considered cheap) and have been averaging down ever since, I feel that 40% of my portfolio is enough. I've been around the block long enough to know that anything out of the blue can happen.  Lexaria, then Organigram, Namaste, Aurora and Cronos are the balance.  Sold Aphria upon Ted's advice - or at least his feeling that they are too self interested. . In an article by Gary B in SA (which is now locked) he felt that Organigram could be a great opportunity and I've seen analysis' that put it at 4-5x its current price. Haven't heard much here about them lately. Anybody have some thoughts?  While we await the return of Ted and his prognostications, I turn to my own analysis of my portfolio. But there are many people here far smarter than I (me). Any insights? Thanks. We have this tight group of maybe 15 people here. We should get together when all this slows down! What an experience that would be. I really appreciate all your help people!",

Yeeeiii Monday :-) Im struggling to identify the entry point (right from a go or sit till 1000 when the hype might be over with all purchases made and enter there) unless everyone thinks the same, not buying at the opening and driving prices up late morning.

"Good evening All, I dont know about you Gents, tomorrow my very last 40K going into topping up IAN, MPX, CVSI and OGI. Like Sunniva, however scooping up SNN last few weeks put me into slight over allotment portofolio %wise. Still awaiting MedMen IPO and after it Im officially broke 😂😂😂  Not sure when to open positions tomorrow as I firmly believe last week announcements from USA including the Friday's Mr. Trump comments will fuel it up to a greater extend than Constellation move in fall 2017. Still paitiently awaiting Mr. Ted's letter which might make me deviate from the above plan. Best of luck to All !",
Hope so.  It seems like it should,
"I think this will be an insane week for Sunniva. With all the shares we have scooped in the last weeks, it must left about nothing to buy. The word Sunniva begin to spread across reddit weedstocks. The future look very bright right now. Hold tight, this will blow up soon!",
The real question is: how and why do you still have cash when Sunniva is $8.50?,
"What are everyone's thoughts on the Green Organic Dutchman? I've heard alot of hype, but that's what concerns me, EVERYONE is talking about it.... I'd like to hear people's thoughts before I make a decision on this one, I mean I have done my own research but my main concern is that the IPO is coming this week and it just seems like there is a bit too much talk to make a play at this time?",
Ted!!! Where are you! We have great news here and we would like how you see the last news release from Sunniva and the last US development!,

"Hey Ill Mon, I care little about whether Sunniva performs better or worse than the pack in the next few months, which is all about Canadian legal rec. I do care about the largest medical marijuana market in the world (California) that will be at the forefront of legitimizing its usage for a growing number of patients and conditions worldwide while exposing the horrors of opioids. While Canopy has received its investment from Constellation and will develop cannabis beers, gummy bears, and cookies, Sunniva is following the route taken by ID Biomedical, but now on an even larger scale. Tilray has already shown there is an appetite for it with the recent Sandoz partnership. Trump just gave a ""hands off"" for MM and Boehner is a now a born-again pothead who is now secretly vaping MM for his own chronic pain. MM has been given a few tailwinds and they have nothing to do with June 7th. Big Pharma's first foray into cannabis arrived with Sandoz-Tilray deal, which demonstrates there is an appetite from big pharma for MM. http://bit.ly/2HgoCCvWhy did Glaxo buy ID Biomedical? This is from http://bit.ly/2vaLe2s1. In 2004, GSK distributed more than 1.5 billion doses of vaccines to 168 countries in both the developed and developing world, an average of 45 doses per second. Fast forward to today where companies have the production and distribution to sell opioids all over the world for great profits. If medical marijuana gains serious traction ( and it is), then what kind of company are the Big Pharm players going to be looking for? Perhaps a guy who has been to that dance before? Perhaps a company that runs a B2B model dedicated to researching and producing MM?2. In the next five years (from 2004), GSK hopes to launch five major new vaccines: an HPV vaccine  targeting cervical cancer, a vaccine against rotavirus (already approved in 13 countries including Mexico), a vaccine to prevent pneumococcal disease, an improved  flu vaccine  for the elderly, and a meningitis combination vaccine for infants in the US.Fast forward to today's environment where the Big Pharma cash cow is under serious attack in markets around the world and most notably in the U.S. The winds of change are shifting for not only alcohol and tobacco but for Big Pharma that now has major regulatory and image problems.DEA’s opioid crackdown brings arrests of prescribers, pharmacists (April 2nd, 2018)https://wapo.st/2HlwqCY3. ID Biomedical has a leading position in the Canadian influenza market. It received a ten-year mandate from the Government of Canada in 2001 to assure a state of readiness in the case of an influenza pandemic and provide influenza vaccine for all Canadians in such an event. It also currently supplies approximately 75% of the Canadian government's influenza vaccine purchases.What I am buying is hopefully a replication of what Holler did with building up ID Biomedical when Glaxo came and paid $1.7 billion, except that this number could be ten times higher or more down the road and Holler knows this. In addition to their own research and production, It seems that their model is like a ""pot incubator"" where they will invite medical marijuana tenants in and support them with tech that cannot be afforded by startups. This allows Sunniva to be a part of the innovation process and adapt their facilities based on the production and research done by a variety of growers targeting different illnesses and conditions.  This patented ecosystem will be replicable around the world and potentially recognized as the leading standard for MM production. Canopy already has recognized this with a bought deal before the shovel has even hit the dirt. Doc Holler wants to replicate and enhance the following for himself and I will tag along for the ride. I think the rebound has begun and the winds have shifted. ""Directors and senior officers of vaccine maker ID Biomedical Corp. are in line for an $80-million jackpot by tendering options and restricted share units under a friendly $1.7-billion takeover bid from GlaxoSmithKline Inc.The big winners, according to Glaxo's proxy material, are ID's chief executive officer Anthony Holler and president Todd Patrick, who will also receive a severance payment of $1.28-million (U.S.) each, if the $35-a-share (Canadian) transaction is concluded. Shareholders are scheduled to vote Nov. 16.In addition, Dr. Holler would receive a total of $39.2-million by tendering 524,734 common shares, 326,667 restricted share units and exercising 369,000 stock options, with an in-the-money value of nearly $9.4-million.""https://tgam.ca/2vdEX5P",

Maybe ignorance, maybe greed. It is a learning experience. Ted gave good advice over a year ago, do what you can stand and don't invest what you can't afford to loose. Sage advice but can fall on deaf ears of a person caught up in a new adventure full of excitement, hype and sugar fairies dancing threw our head. Fast forward to reality. Sell and take whatever gains and not complain about ""what you could have had"" or double down and go for broke.... I feel sorry for people who went in over their heads, I am not loosing at this point, just not gaining. My gains have given me room to run so not critical yet but I guess if push comes to shove, I will ""gamble it all"".  I either win or lose. My personal call. Either way thanks Ted and no negative here. Not every battle has a good outcome but in the end winning the war is what counts......",

"It is hard to know the composition of shareholders, but I suspect that many of us made good money in November - January rally, which I think started with the Constellation deal with Canopy.  The wiser among us have taken lots of profits and built up cash for times like now, but many others (self included) did not take enough profits and now are fully invested in the sector.  We watch week after week as our profits decline and start thinking about the prospect we may actually go all the way back down to where we started. We begin to doubt, maybe these articles about 90% downside are valid, etc.  Some will sell and try to be satisfied with the gains they made, others will tough it out and either decline further or make lots of money when the market rallies again. Then again others may sell part of their positions to get ready for even lower prices.For myself, I am hanging on but may trim some on days like today when we are getting a nice little relief rally.  Seems to be correlated with FB and Zuckerman testifying.   Wierd but I will take it.",
"Oak Or, evidently my reply did not go through, if it did this is redundent. Thanks but if Trump can't get past the locker room bullshit and stuff we may have all said or done in our life, I would not make it to a town hall as my  life would read like a sleazy novel. Investing in Canada Cannabis was not my first choice. I originally thought with a forward thinking Presiident we would begin to rebuild America. Our infrastructure is shot, our military is weak, our people are divided on too many issues. America was the super power and now we are a border line 3rd world status. We are not liked by most countries unless we have the ""The Good Humor Ice Cream Truck"" rolling down their street. Our education system is pathetic as we have gone from being ranked #1 to somewhere in the teens. Finland, I believe is #1, go fish huh???? I really thought that tech, energy, infrastucture, military spending would all be good plays. Heck the man is moving forward despite the overwhelming bullshit that is blocking him. Why is China making consessions, Why is the little Fat Guy in N. Korea being a better dog... You know and I know but I am not here to talk politics. I can't take a country that was formed on a industrilized platform and after running it in the ground in our quest for Socialism and Globalization make it whole again.  If I have to pick an enemy, I sure don't want it to be my rival so if I don't approve of how Putin runs his house that;s ok as long as he doesn't try to run mine. It is high time we start worring about America and let God worry about the rest of his people. I am compassionate but not at the expense of loosing America. Hell, the proud Eagle is beginning to look like a common Buzzard. I learned as a young boy, you never talked the school yard bully out of taking your lunch money with diplomacy... Canadain Cannabis represents an investment that is not concerned with color, Gays, 2nd amendment, 1 st. amendment, or any other bullshit. It is soon to be a unified commodity that is shared by all and the money that will be made is not discriminating......",
how do we not factor in the USA tax issues on Cannabis companies. a lot of talk about potential earnings in California however no one discussed the fact that the taxes are enormous up to 70 percent in USA federal tax and eat up profits. the high taxes are due to it being an illegal substance at the federal level. I would like to see an evaluation that factors in this aspect. thanks.,
Please sell me your shares of sunniva in the $6 range. Thank you.,
"Well,ask Bugs Bunny would say, WEEEL, THAT'S ALL FOLKS!. Ted has taken the time and  investigative skills to lay it on the line. I have seen many of the same posters time after time and know you ""will stay the course"" as will I. Thank You Ted for your thoughts, it was beyond the call of duty, you owe us no explanation. Many of you no I use illustrations, some have been liked and many have not but it is how I view situations in my own mind. I am very fortunate to have been in combat and a decorated participant. I mention this as many may not like what I say but I feel I have earned this right. ANY MAN that has not for at least a split second in the heat of a battle never thought of BREAKING RANKS and RUNNING, is the same guy that insists he never MASTURBATED. Crude but true. When your ammo is low and the dark surrounds you like an envelope and your mind is unabile to quite your fears, their is that deciding MOMENT when you remember WHO you ARE and WHY your there. I have often said in my own business there are times business and combat are closely related. To have a person in Command or Authority that you trust, stand before you and remind you of all the good things you are and who you are made a world of difference. Ted is such a person. He is not sugar coating or hiding back at base camp, he is in the trench holding the hands of the fearful and leading the BRAVE. I realize this may sound dramatic but it is the essense of the battle we find ourselves in presently. I for one understand my postion so will use my ammo cautiously but will not waver in the face of fear... Ok, a little drum roll, please. All bullshit aside, WE knew ther were risks and yes there has been some pain but WE also know the enivetible victory will come. Will their be casulaties, sure, will their be collateral damage sure, but will we WIN, Yes.. Thanks Ted.....",

"Umpire1: may cooler heads prevail indeed!  I think we are all just a little spoiled seeing the incredible gains from cannabis stocks going into 2018.Everyone else - What is going on with this board lately?  Every day I see countless comments from investors who sound like they are ready to jump off the proverbial bridge.  Ted has written 3 or 4 articles about Sunniva already... and there has been no material change in the company's business blueprint since then.  Instead of asking him the same damn questions, just pull up the old article(s) and read it.  The entire cannabis sector has been getting crushed lately, and SNN's stock has seen a similar decline in line with all the rest.  I am invested heavily in Sunniva just like the rest of you.  At this point you have two choices: sell and take a loss, or hang on and see where it goes.  Whatever answer it is, that you THINK you are looking for... Ted cannot give that to you. I think the only thing that can comfort your jitters is seeing the stock price appreciate.And as much respect as I have for Ted, he unfortunately isn't god and will not be able to make that happen.  But do you know what can make that happen? Time.  So let's all take a step back and take a deep breathe.",

"I have not recieved mine either. I believe Ted is in a CHESS GAME mode. He has to weigh his comments very carefully. Tensions are high and as we have seen ""the crowd can get ugly... Now there is alot of money out there and Sunnvia is under the spotlight and doesn't have an expierence period behind them. This makes for guess work.... I will use the story of SHOPIFY to illustrate. SHOP was a little known company that was bucking some strong headwind. However they recieve constant support from Motely Fool and several others toting it as the next AMAZON. They have an amazing visionary leadership and attracted high quality people and started utilizing advancements in tech and were able to fend off Amazon and E Bay. They took off like rockets and  attracted alot of attention and with that a lot of big negative press that led to shorting, Big Time, I watched $40.00 a share drop in a matter of a week.. I believed in the company because they had demenostrated their ability to bounce back at every attack. It took a while but they came back.  There last attcack was a repeat of history and sold their stock at a $60.00 per share gain. I still believe they are winners but didn't want to wait it out as I felt Ted's excitement for Sunniva so threw it in there. Now why this long winded story. I felt the same level of confidence in Ted as I did in Shops Leadership. This puts a lot of pressure on a person. Now it was pointed out that Ted is offering FREE advice so no bitches  coming but in reality you and I know that We do  really on Ted's  ""thoughts"". NOW SHOP had some history Sunniva doesn't. I don't think Ted could be that  easy to fool but THINK of the ramifications if by chance this not what it appears to be. PLENTY of unhappy campers!!!! I believe Ted is really getting into a lot of faces before the music stops and JACK jumps out of the box.. OMO",

It was Christmas Eve and not a soul around. At the end of the hall I could year a lot of ""yowling"" going on. I inquired with the nurse if that was my wife in Labor and she told me yes. I asked if she was recieving the best medical care that could be provided, she assured me that was the case, I also asked if there were any unusual problems, she again assured me there where none.

And I can see how when part of what you do for a living is performing due diligence on hundreds of penny stocks and other more or less questionable companies and their management teams, you develop a certain cynicism that you revert to by default. However, I do believe Dr Holler and his team deserve the benefit of the doubt, not only because of their undeniable past achievements (ID Biomedical, Corriente Resources, Lululemon etc) but also because of how far along they are with Sunniva on what is still a very low share count. Am I 100% certain that they'll be able to pull off a $100m debt financing? No. Do I think it's more likely than not? Yes, I do, and I wish to participate in the upside. Alan may characterize me as a ""bagholder"", and comment about my ""financial loss"", but in truth, I am a Part Owner of the Company, and I suffered no loss - all I did was acquire the bulk of my shares at a higher price than the present price.

So those that HOPE will always be jittery, those that have faith know the outcome but maybe not the exact time frame.

It hit an all-time low of 6.20 earlier this morning and seems to be bouncing back some. More likely than not, we've seen the bottom already and just need people to lose the fear and buy in at current market rates. While I understand that Canadian cannabis has no real ties to the flux of the US stock market, we should keep in mind how many US investors there are.  The Dow Jones started at -500 pts this morning and a lot of folks were just panicked and trying to salvage what they could of their hard earned money.  If you're in it now, just suck it up and you'll be glad you did when June comes around.",
My opinion is that these last few days are in response to the potential trade war with China panic.  This is a spill over event.  My thoughts are Canadian companies cannot export to the US anyways and Sunniva will manufacture in the US anyway.  Sometimes these sharp drops are what starts the beginning of the bull market.   We are almost two months away from the senate vote......,

"Since good news is hard to come by these days, I think this article is worth a look and perhaps a solid indicator of good times ahead for Sunniva in California and Canada post legal rec. The pendulum has now swung too far past center and is due to reverse course in the cannabis space.Recreational marijuana sales brisk, problems few in San Diego 3 months into legalizationhttps://dpo.st/2IrqdlH",
"Hello everyone, I found this article that should help calm those of you who are nervous about the recent dips (you shouldn't be). Here is the link to the original article https://tgam.ca/2uJLIMJ (keep in mind it is locked but I managed to copy it for you guys to read it without having to subscribe) Beacon Securities analyst Vahan Ajamian said Sunniva Inc. (SNN-CN) presents investors with rare exposure to two of the world’s largest cannabis markets – Canada and California. He initiated coverage of Vancouver-based producer with a “speculative buy” rating. “While there is no shortage of ‘we will grow weed and sell it’ stories out there, in our opinion, Sunniva clearly gains tremendous credibility and differentiates itself from the pack due to the following two main factors,” said Mr. Ajamian.“First, ‘they have literally done this before.’ Dr. Anthony Holler, Sunniva’s CEO, was previously the Founder and CEO of ID Biomedical. ID Biomedical built the world’s largest flu vaccine manufacturing facility, presold its production, and sold the company to GlaxoSmithKline for $1.7-billion in 2005. Second, in February 2018, Sunniva announced a definitive take or pay supply agreement with Canopy Growth Corp. (WEED-T), to supply it with 45,000 kilograms of production from its B.C. facility a year for an initial term of two years – by far the largest transaction in legal cannabis history.”Mr. Ajamian noted the pricing realized from the Canopy agreement will be governed by a revenue share, thus Sunniva’s take remains uncertain. However, he said he cannot envision a scenario where it would receive less than $3 per gram from sales.“This would thus generate a minimum of $135-million of sales for Sunniva in each of the two years,” he said. “A group of U.S. cannabis operators currently trade at an enterprise value-to-calendar 2019 estimated sales multiple of 2.0 times. Applying this multiple on the aforementioned $135-million of sales (even though these are entirely Canadian sales for Sunniva, and no U.S. operator has anywhere near such committed volumes – never mind to Canopy, which we consider to have extremely low credit risk) results in an implied EV of $270-million versus an EV of $266-million or all of Sunniva. Accordingly, we argue that investors are essentially paying for the value of Sunniva’s contract with Canopy and thus getting the other three businesses for free (i.e., California greenhouse, NHS and VC – plus whatever else the company can produce and sell from its B.C. greenhouse).”“While we anticipate that there will initially be shortages of low cost, high quality and pesticide free legal product, we believe the industry could eventually see a surplus,” the analyst said. “We believe Sunniva stands to benefit under such a scenario from its focus on low cost production at scale – as well as the diversification of the markets it serves (i.e., both Canada and California).Sunniva has been trading for less than three months – during a period largely marked by a pullback in the sector (average stock is down 33 per cent). Until today Sunniva had no analyst coverage and, fresh off its $28-million oversubscribed financing, we believe investors will quickly and increasingly take note of this name. We recommend investors acquire shares aggressively at current levels.”",
Investors who are fatigued after  3 months since company IPO are not a investors only speculants and opportunitiests .If Sunniva will drop tommorow more I wanna thank in advance  to all donors who will help to increase my position in this company.,
"Investors in the MJ sector are fatigued in the industry, not to mention a healthy offset from the NASDAQ / DOW / S&P--Investors are bit fatigued due to legalization seemingly being pushed out past the anticipated July Date. Many were expecting July and I suspect are exiting due to short term goals / impatience / can't stomach / market emotions. Dr. Holler said ""we will be the last one's standing"" as they are taking a steady.. aim.. focused approach. It will be interesting to see what's in store for the road show in the near future. They were in California recently for a ROTH conference and the conference went well according to George at Investor Relations.

"Slightly off the subject and just for the general education :- ) Saint Sunniva (10th century) is the patron saint of the Norwegian Diocese of Bjørgvin, as well as all of Western Norway.According to legend, Sunniva was the heir of an Irish kingdom, but had to flee when a heathen king, who wanted to marry her, invaded. At the Norwegian island of Selja, in the present-day municipality of Selje, she and her followers took refuge in a cave. The locals suspected the foreigners of stealing their sheep, and the ruler Håkon Jarl was sent for. Sunniva and her followers prayed to God that they should not fall into the hands of the heathens, upon which rocks fell down blocking the entrance to the cave.Sunniva and the others died in the cave, but in the years to come miracles were reported on the island. When the Christian king Olaf Tryggvason excavated the cave in 996, the body of Sunniva was found intact. Later a Benedictine monastery, Selje Abbey, was built on the site, the ruins of which can still be seen",
"Ted, Noticed on your weekly newsletter you downgrade aphria’s management and not recommending the company.

Also they own less than 1 percent and I’m pretty sure no disclosure is required unless they own more than 1 percent.  Isn’t it more of nuuvera s responsibility to disclose that information than it is for the executives at aphria?",

When it moved to over the $150.00 mark I truly felt it will come back as their model is good but do not have the stomach to wait that many months as my investment time period is about 2-3 years then a revision.

Just because you've taken a beating with this marijuana stock does not mean it's a safe bet or a bargain today.  Be very careful.

Just as important is the fact that the really big risk of tariffs is a generic negative impact on growth, both domestically and internationally in a trade war.  If world trade is significantly reduced then we all suffer and there will be no real hiding from it.  Instead I suggest writing to your political representatives, beginning with the President, and urge them not to allow the US to proceed on this risky path.  If the President is determined, than the Congress should stop wringing its hands and pass veto-proof legislation which puts an end to this foolishness!",Tariffs: There's An ETF For That!

good intro to shire ... will watch this name and possibly buy the dip.  thank you mr. pink sand.,
"hello Autofocus111 and Pink SandsThank you for taking the trouble to respond.in my post above I tried to list some points that may be a drag on market performance. I did not mean to say these points were negative from a business point of view - after all I did buy some shares, so I must see some upside.As for Ireland: NO objection - low tax rate, comprehensive jurisdiction, common law, access to a big market,  - all good.Just the combination / complexity as listed under 3. above might turn off some people that would find the business convincing were it focused say on the U.S.As for Non-GAAP numbers: Yes,  they do have their merits especially in the case of takeover as you  say. They may have a good track record but big moves like Baxalta make some people a little nervous especially in the current elevated valuation reality. I did not find anything remotely like a red flag - used them as basis for my  investment decision and bought some. Basically Shire is relatively new to me, so I have some reading to do to get up to speed (but there are so many other things to do...and bigger position get more attention)Thanks and keep up the good work.NIcklaas",
"Thanks for your input, Pink Sands.Have a small position in Shire to motivate myself to watch it closely. A few pointers why one might harbor some doubts:1. So many good numbers, but alas to much nonGAAP in their presentations - One does not quite know what to make of them. Janus - effect: may reveal underlying business better or management lead you down the garden path. Result: caution.2. Guidance - not so much progress in 2018. May have added to drag.3. Shire is Irish based, has its primary stock quote in London and most of its business in the U.S. while rapidly growing the international business. This kind of complexity may also drag on valuation.RegardsNIcklaas",

"PinkSands I appreciate the writeup on this underfollowed company thanks. As longtime SHPG investors know, the BXLT acquisition was a huge step up in target size. Prior to it, SHPG had only ever struck deals that were an order of magnitude lower in scale. That said, it was a transformative acquisition that has repositioned the firm nicely for the years ahead, so not sure why you chose to sell it then (however it was a good move in retrospect). I had little doubt SHPG would execute on synergies and pay down debt taken on for the deal quickly, as was promised. At this juncture, I would prefer SHPG direct excess cash flow after continued debt reduction and capex towards share repurchases instead of dividend increases or further acquisitions... those can come later.",

"LB is an interesting retail stock as  it produces a considerable amount of cash flow.   The stock seems to have been affected mostly by worries about Amazon, as are all retailers, but also some softness in Victorias Secrret sales..I wonder how much serious competition exists for VS?   My impression is that they basically own this market.  Fashions come and go, consumer tastes change, but who really is going to take much business from VS.  My familiarity with one Pink location, where a student relative works is that the store is basically a gold mine.  Much of the time, the cash registers have long lines. They really don't discount. You can't buy their stuff on Amazon or Ebay.   Seems to be a great business model baaed on one store, admittedly, but duplicate it if you can.Some signs out there of shopping mall business coming back.  One mall owner, CBL properties, which is landlord to many  of LBs stores, says they are seeing a significant 5% range increase in sales per square foot sales in January and February for tenants that have space of 10000 ft and below.   This is probably happening at malls owned by other companies is should be viewed as very positive for LB.The company is very profitable.

LB always gives poor guidance, only to beat at the end of the quarter.   The herd does not notice this and just repeats what was said earlier.  Maybe what I am really asking for is an article on the effect of the herd mentality on investing and stock prices.Just a thought or two.",

"There are 2 ways to look at MNK's valuation. Once to compare it to the metrics of HZNP and ENDP and the other to compare it in relation to how much they sold the two meds to Baxter.Baxter paid 3.5x the revenu the 2 meds fetch annually. Using that logic and applying some bulk premium, let's assume that 3.5 billion worth of revenue at 2.5x. That's 8.7b value. Add cash on hand, brings to 10b, add quarterly cashflow and you're at 10.2...deduct 6.7b of debt, deduct 300m of contingency funding etc and you're left with a whopping 3.3 billion for a 86 million share count... That's almost 40$ per share.The second way if you're to apply the metrics of ENDP AND HZNP, both being in a significantly worse shape than MNK, you'd come up at least double the value for MNK... so, I'd say it would be prudent to assume their current FMV at around 35$...",
"While I admit you being right on VRX and WFT, this time you're totally wrong... They will pay off every penny that they borrowed for Sucampo within a year. The company is with little over 1.5 times their annual cash flow. Someone must be totally insane to short this. Of course, it will take years before it can hit back 60s and 70s but it can double from these levels with a blink of an eye. From my perspective, with an average cost of less than 15$, I risk a 3$ drop to the worst case scenario VS 15$ increase to the best case one with a 90 day horizon span. SE, their leverage will get to below 4 if they fetch anything above 1.5b for their generics while their cash being 45, 50% of their total debt. This alone would prop the stock to 25$ range... I see no reason no classify generics as Disc. Ops unless they expect a sale very soon..",
Stock price is unacceptable. Management has to make a move. The paradox is that cheaper shares are great for the buy-back programme. I hope they will lift the ceiling to 20m share per quarter.,

Based on Mallinckrodt's strong track record of deleveraging after the previous acquisitions, we remain confident in the company's commitment to reducing leverage before pursuing any others. As such, we expect Mallinckrodt to limit its 2018 business-development and share-repurchase activities and direct internally generated cash flow to reduce leverage. We also recognize Mallinckrodt's strong track record of successfully integrating acquisitions and expect a smooth integration of Sucampo.""",

"Excellent series, Vladimir.  For me, you are one of the go-to guys in this space.As you point out, one of the issues in the industry is rig oversupply, implying significant numbers of stacked rigs will end up in the graveyard.  Presumably, this will drive similarly significant changes in drillers' balance sheets and book values.  With the rig supply/demand data you have assembled, I wonder if it would be possible to make estimates of the likely book values of the key players after a potential scrapping ""spree"" has run its course.  Could this give any insight into the possible stock prices of these players once rig supply has been rationalized?",

Bravo - Vlad - Thank You for the interesting and insightful series.  Hopefully we see an increase in demand as the overall picture that emerged was a global market that is oversupplied at the moment.  GLTA,
"Thank you, Vladimir. I highly appreciate all your great work.I agree with you that there is quite some oversupply but as soon as companies like Ensco (17 old JUs) and Borr (after the Paragon acquisition) really start scrapping rigs (as soon as the old ones come off contract) and companies like COSL and Shelf Drilling buy some new rigs (in order to replace the old ones), the JU market could change rapidly.

"Loved your series, great work. Hard to believe so many companies ordered so many rigs?",
"Vlad, nice series of articles.Here's what I'm thinking.  In the 2014-17 period, FIDs collapsed.  This is a ticking time bomb.  I saw a Goldman Sachs chart today which showed the impact of ""lost oil"" from the delayed FIDs of the past few years.  By their calculations in 2018, we will have lost 2.5 mmbpd from FIDs that would normally have been made but were delayed because of industry underinvestment.  By 2021 that increases to 4 mmbpd and by 2024 that increases to 6 mmbpd.  The purpose of FIDs is to bring new oil into the market to supply demand growth and, more importantly, supply lost to depletion, which is currently about 7% a year.  Let's use 2021 as our reference point.  Without adjusting for depletion (7%/year), by 2021 demand will have increased by 6 mmbpd and we will have lost 4 mmbpd from delayed FIDs.  I think there is a very real possibility of a severe supply squeeze.  When you explore for oil, you drill a few holes here and there.  But when you sanction a project for FID, you go into development mode.  You are drilling lots and lots of holes.  I think the falloff in demand for rigs is a direct function of the failure to sanction FIDs these past few years.  With a potentially severe supply squeeze looming as early as 2021, I would think these rigs have got to get back to work and soon.",

Even minute perception of lower price for its products can cause wild swings in its price. All these comments about MU deserves higher multiple, are just wishful ones. It’s simply not going to happen, as it didn’t happened during the last fifty years or so.",
It looks like MU found a bottom long before the market tanked today.I see this as a positive.,
Seems like this temporary retrenchment would be a good time to think about taking out the convertibles.,
To:mjaminianHaving been long on MU for the last 2+ years I'm a very happy investor.It is my largest holding by far. With a p/e ratio of about 6 it is a bargain.Look at the stats and join the pros. ( 85% & counting! ),
"Thank you author for a good article. Everyone needs an edge to be successful in the market. The back test result is great! Thanks, Regarding the reaction of MU stock price, experienced investors/traders should know that stock price reflects the future. It almost always goes before the event. So the current spectacular earning report already reflected in the price. Otherwise why do the stock went from $38 on 2/9 to $63 on 3/12? That is 65% appreciation in a month. Isn't that enough to show that investors are supper happy about the result? 65% up!! It just went before the result came out. We see this again and again. Kite Pharma, price went from $60 to $150 before the GILD merger announcement. I can go on and on. People in the market are super smart. They already knew the good things happening. So they bought in advance. I believe the dip in MU is a good buying opportunity. Because as I said, the stock will go up again before the June report to anticipate another spectacular report. Rinse and repeat!!",

Given the nearly 85% institutional ownership, fantastic fundamentals and forward guidance, and less than 6 forward PE, there is a lot of potential here.

So apparantly CCXI does not think that these are ""almost the same target"" as you have suggested.Hope I'm not nitpicking here. Thanks!",
"I spoke with Steve Klass ( IR for CCXI ) and he told me in conversation over the phone that for now, we should think of aHUS as behind C3G in order of importance.

Here is his written response for all CCXI investor's to see.....thanks to the author for a good article and good writings....Steven Klass <sklass@burnsmc.com...     Mar 26 at 9:25 AMTo Joseph Caetano  Hi Joe, In terms of status, as the Company mentioned during its Q4 2017 earnings call, CCXI is currently dosing patients with aHUS under a compassionate use protocol.  Given that the aHUS patient population is fairly hard to come by, the number of patients that CCXI has access to has been limited (other sponsors are dealing with this as well). The Company hopes to present data from the compassionate use in aHUS patients in the not-to-distant future, potentially at one of the upcoming medical meetings. Please feel free to give me a call if you need additional clarification.  Thanks, Steve",
Great read. Once again. I tend to agree with you on ahus. You’re basically limited to international patients in ahus trials. Similar to Omeros. It’s definitely a worthy cause if nothing else for the ahus patients as it would present a great improvement in convenience over existing treatments.,
"Nice update Oneil Trader,I was very pleased with hearing ChemoCentryx will be going after new indications in 2018 - HS could represent a sizeable market. The company has a great platform and seems to make the most out of it at the moment, which is encouraging. Concerning aHUS, I sincerely hope that ChemoCentryx won't be focusing too much on the programme, given the reasons you've already mentioned.I wonder when analysts will start/resume CCXI coverage, I'd be interested to hear what they think.",
"A good exchange of ideas. As a long term investor in CCXI, I do recall a transcript of a quarterly call, whereby on a a question on aHUS, somebody at CCXI specifically mentioned more than interest in this disease, and said that they could be well rewarded, if it worked well, considering the price Soliris was charging. Based on that, I believe that CCXI is certainly working towards that end, and if you have not included that in your estimates, then that would be a positive. But thanks for your input.",
"Go to their CCXI website and look at their PIPELINE sectionIt clearly shows for CCX-168  aHUS as a indication being under development......with the words.... ""Initiate registration supporting trial in 2018"".So I think it was.....kind of.....  on their minds..... a bit more than....""a nice big bonus"".....esp. if they are planing on a Registration supporting Trial.I just sent a email out to Steve Klass,  CCXI Investor relations, and Susan Kayana CFO on this point regarding.... whats the plan regarding aHUS, and is there a clear defined policy by the company going forward to address this market opportunity in 2018.As soon as they respond, I will post their response here. I appreciate your story on the company and I am long CCXI, as you are, so we are both on the same side.....thats cool.I hope they can develop the CCX-168 asset to include aHUS , as well as the other indications you mentioned because I firmly believe we could compete against Soliris easily if the drug shows promising efficacy.",
"From the Q4 CC Tom Schall....in response to question concerning aHUS , this is from Seeking Alpha transcript of the CC....""aHUS you're quite correct, we are in fact dosing patients actively right now with aHUS. It's under our compassionate use protocol. So we'll have more to say about those results, I think in the coming quarter or so, but it won't surprise you of course the aHUS patient population is very hard to come by. So the number of patients that we have access to is regrettably not great. And we're struggling with that as our other sponsors. So we'll be clarifying the picture around aHUS and our approach to that as we go forward and I hope to be able to present some of the findings from our ongoing compassionate use patients in the not too distant future.""",
"Good article.....BUT the serious money making indication is for Avacopan in aHUS where it can compete....head to head with Soliris, which has a black box warning.If CCXI can show good results in that indication, then this stock will make SERIOUS money for the company as Soliris is getting appx $500,000 per patient ( actually its closer to $600,000, but lets not argue over dimes and nickles ...LOL )  in treating aHUS. Based on that number CCXI can charge $200,000 for CCX-168 and still save Insurance companies and patients a TON of money over Soliris !!Wht didnt you adress this opportunity ( aHUS )  in your article ??!!!",ChemoCentryx: Significant Progress In Recent Months

"Some thoughts about Roku:As a company Roku, while a major player in streaming devices, is limited in options for content - the key to sustained revenue in the streaming sector. First, Roku started as a part of Netflix but was eventually spun off to ease competition concerns vs Apple, Amazon and Google. Primarily Apple. Netflix’s core business is content and there was a concern that competing with a device as well would complicate future content deals with those behemoth tech companies. All of them have strong hardware experience complete with strong content libraries.Second, Roku is now trying to create proprietary content by adding ‘channels’ which largely sound like a Roku version of premium YouTube channels. People can create their own channels and stream their own video. This can open a messy can of copyright worms if Roku doesn’t have a strong system in place to prevent and remove unauthorized content. If it’s too permissible then copyright owners can hurt them in court, if it’s too restrictive they will have difficulty getting people to sign up to create them. On top of that YouTube is available on all streaming devices as well as the internet making it the choice for independent content creators. Third, Roku is still very dependent on Netflix for a significant chunk of content streamed on their devices. (Netflix would be an excellent growth investment in a downturn / correction.) Netflix has the budget and deal making power to negotiate with content owners for streaming rights and is not device limited. Netflix also has the volume of eyeballs needed to create proprietary content without complicating streaming rights deals.Fourth, Roku’s two tiered stock is a very bad setup for long term investors. Voting power aside the ipo filings show that the long term plan is to convert class B shares into class A shares instead of issuing new shares. I’m not sure if they are required to file a notice of class conversion the same way they are required to file a notice of issuance. I’ve been unable find a quick answer and 90% of what i did find applies to UK law. But either way most investors will not be looking for the conversion notice and mat not understand that their holdings are being diluted by class conversion. In summary, Roku might be a good trade investment but not a long term investment. The trade investment would need to take into consideration the first through third points to inform the financials, a weak quarterly may be a strong sign of future weakness if the Roku content revenue is weak. The device revenue can be weak without impacting the content revenue because Roku can rely on existing devices for content revenue. But in the longer term device revenue from new and upgrading users will signal future content revenue levels. The forth point can be used to signal an exit and entry point based on dilution. Pre-conversion would be an ideal time to exit a position on Roku and post-conversion would be a good time to enter or re-enter a position on Roku. Disclosure: this on Roku is without doing any serious investigation. A more informed person may have a more nuanced view.",

"Recent slide in NVDA probably due to index funds and ETF holdings being thinned out by alarmists.

You are correct in how much Xifaxan means for Valeant's bottom line, I've said it before that a bet on Valeant is a bet on Xifaxan.  The market also knows how important Xifaxan is,http://bit.ly/2DQwc0TThe earliest patent expiry is 8/2019, it will be interesting to watch for upcoming court battles between Actavis, Allergan (first to file ANDA), and Valeant.  I doubt any one will do an at risk launch but you never know, both those companies especially Allergan has the resources and incentives to do so.http://bit.ly/2vuR0KiAs of now Rifamycin approval is a very small threat because it is only for TD, and the course of tx for it is only 3 days... so it is not a lucrative market.  IBS-D requires longer tx, and HE even longer, both at higher dosages so that's where the money is at.  Cosmo has an on going trial for IBS-D, it just entered phase ii so at least several years away.The big game changer for Xifaxan would be if Valeant can get approval for Crohn's.  It would extend patents for Xifaxan for many years, it is also a large market.  http://bit.ly/2wKk9Qkhttp://bit.ly/2IPML0nthis study just concluded, but it just enrolled 36 patients... not nearly enough to get approval.  By comparison when Salix got Xifaxan approved for IBS-D, the study enrolled over 2,500.It remains to be seen if Valeant will spend the money to do a large scale clinical trial, but I don't see anything.  Also see how that study took 9 years (yeah, these things can take this long)... I'm not sure if Valeant is looking at that kind of a time frame (at least 2-3 years).",

The release and accessibility of games like Fortnite I think will seriously limit the performance of TTWO as a whole because the number of active players on Fortnite, and the number of players spending money in the otherwise free game. - I think the $130 is fair, but with a lot of that growth being driven once RDR2 is released in the fall. I think the 100-110 level is maintained until around that time.",

Alright got an answer from IR just now. They will report on Monday 4/2,
I'm not sure that's what I've been wondering. Not sure if they could file for an extension due to the new auditor they got. Maybe someone else knows these rules better. Their IR team told me mid Feb and mid March and missed both those and then stopped answering. If it's an awful one (I don't see how it could be good) I could also see them sneaking it out there last minute late in the afternoon like RIOT does.,
Are they in VIOLATION if they don't file a 10-k by then end of the day?,

Awesome thanks for the update and please keep us informed. Great work as always!,
is he defending the stock right now by doing all these things? i thot he said his market cap is not justified,
haha you're too funny man. You did a nice job on all this and I think passing along the FTSE announcement will light a fire under their butt more than you ever could trying to reason with them.You just have to remember these are big corporations that are slow moving and their employees likely don't want to hear it because if you're right it means someone screwed up big time and it will be a lot of extra work to correct it.,
Grant great work on this. Cuebert have you been in contact with Dow Jones too and if so have they said anything yet? I believe we also have earnings due by the end of the week although their IR team constantly lies and pushes back the date every time I email them. Negative (really no) earnings could take some more wind out of their sail.,
"""We are reapplying"" for inclusion in the indexes, Longfin CEO Venkat Meenavalli told CNBC in a phone interview Tuesday. He said the stock's free float has increased above the minimum 5 percent as of March 11 due to the expiration of a lockup period on a consultant's stock holdings.""I thought Andy's shares come off lock up in June..does anyone know what shares the CEO could be referring to?http://tinyurl.com/yc5...",

Does anyone know when the lockup period expires?,
Nice call Grant.,
"CNBC had the LFIN CEO on for a Power Lunch interview in mid December and it was crazy!! I'm surprised the guy agreed to do it.Clearly they're using fraud/manipulation of a small float to control the share price. Their goal must have been to get added to a few indexes and sell down to zero once the lock-ups expired, and/or hedge with options.This is amazing. They go after Mark Cuban and Martha Stewart for insider trading and yet, somehow, this steaming pile of turd was allowed to trade??? Disgusting.My guess is the management team's sole intent was to collect from early short sellers who were right, but didn't understand the small float could be easily manipulated. I can't believe index funds added this steamer without doing proper checking. One more reason to avoid most funds.Outstanding job by Grant!!  I wish there was a better way to short this fraudulent turkey.Grant, can you do a follow up on what you think is the best move now for LFIN non-believers?",

"OldAnCap, if you want to jump in on the short side, you have basically 3 choices:1. Buy Puts....this one is very tough because the premium for those puts is very high right due to the volatility of LFIN and possibly insiders with locked-up shares buying puts.2. Sell the shares short....this one is tough right now too because the cost to borrow the stock costs over 100% a year.  If you sell short 1,000 shares at $70, you receive $70,000 into your account, but it will cost you $70,000 a year ($191 a day) to borrow that stock.  Further, that cost to borrow could easily go higher.3.  Sell calls to capture the premium...another tough one because this requires a high amount of money deposited in your account (check with your BD), and then there’s the risk that the price goes higher as the shorts get squeezed further and you could get assigned the common.  I’m not super clear on all the nuance to this one.For me, I did #2 above and it’s been expensive.   At this point, I wish I had the foresight to follow the advice of  leeo268.   If you want to jump in, do #1, but buy puts way out of the money...maybe Sept 20s, 25s, or 30s and limit your up and down side.   If that’s too boring, try #1 and have some very tight mental stops.",

"papayamonWe have different bottom lines.My bottom line is that the company remains independent with NEW management, because any new buyer will take advantage what Cerberus, Standley, and the Rite Aid board has done to us; we will still get crumbs.

Standley would have ""zero"" credibility on Wall St.You, yourself are talking about what the company is worth in competent hands, but I do not blame you for being fed up and wanting to wait for the uncertain.The good news here, if we ever get to Court, not yet assured, is that Standley's false statements and the boards eyebrow raising decisions will be used against them.  I will go out on a limb, rarely has an attorney had so much to work with.

"I think that the bottom line comes down to whether or not we get another offer for RAD, that people will see getting past the FTC.

Nonetheless, the worth of these stores is much greater in the hands of competent management, and anyone buying the company will know this.  The clock will be ticking as soon as Cerberus lays the proxy on the table.  I say Cerberus because RAD's management works for them and they are effectively controlling the company while they try to steal it.",
"papayamonI have to disagree with you a little.When you say that ""millions of people getting fleeced by RAD management, and they have no idea its happening"", whose fault is that really?  The proxy statements over the years have been very clear about board/management wrongdoing, information I used in the past to file written Complaints to The SEC, which resolved the issues, when the board would not.Also, it is likely that most complainers here, (especially long-term investors) including you if you were honest about it, never showed up to an Annual Meeting, never even wrote a letter to the board about what you read in the proxies that should have been troubling, etc.  Some of you probably also visited your local Rite Aid store in the past and could not believe what you were seeing, but did nothing to try to make things better.  Not all the stores are bad, but enough are for various reasons and some of you did not make a peep about your investment entrusted in incompetent hands. So, complaining now comes just a little late, but hopefully not too late.I have confessed that I should have been more vocal much earlier, any confession by some here that you did not watch your investment enough, especially the long-term investors?  And what about the institutions , that are a total disgrace.  They allow a mess to occur, and then just bailout, with their investors none the wiser, because a loss can be hidden among the winners.  Proving, once again, that life really isn't fair.",
"Steve:The fact that NewCo stock would have to TRIPLE in value to equate to what WBA paid for the smaller part of Rite Aid shows how bad a deal this is, and that Standley's comment about shareholder value was pure lying garbage. Citi should be sued for false and misleading value appraisal information as regards ABS, calling it $24 when the market values it at $14. Money and politics are not strange bedfellows. That Cerberus contacts within the current administration and the  FTC weigh heavily on the outcome cannot be ignored. WBA negotiated downward to arrive at a fair valuation for it's purchases, so the questions loom, why wasn't this valuation held to by Standley? What was  the need to sell? Did he feel RAD was unable to survive? If so, why does he expect RAD to all of a sudden provide income and growth to ABS when it obviously cannot provide income and growth for itself?  Why did Standley keep his shareholders in the dark by misleading them to think we were going to be a stronger, more profitable company while working in the shadows with ABS? And why, if he and the Board were supposedly shopping the company, did no one know to whom, for how much, and for how long? My feeling is they weren't. That they ignored all fiduciary responsibility and pulled a white-collar scam at the cost of billions in shareholder value for the sole purpose of enriching themselves.I hope you have some luck getting reporters to dig into this. A nice piece on 60 Minutes would give me something decent to watch for a change.",
"kuttingedgeIt is really worse than you indicated above.  Walgreens did not just shut down ANY Rite Aid stores, they shut down 600 Rite Aid stores WITHIN ONE (1) MILE OF AN EXISTING WALGREENS STORE, i.e. The FTC intentionally gave their blessing to this to make sure Walgreens had LESS competition, not even making sure they had at least the SAME competition, such as with a sale to Freds.  It appears this was Walgreens consolation prize/gift from The FTC, given that I do believe there may be , I repeat could be, collusion between The FTC and this ultimate outcome of a Cerberus bid, given the facts before us.  Let us also not forget that The FTC had no problem allowing Rite Aid to purchase 1800 Eckerd stores, lessening competition and allowing Rite Aid to grow by over 50%, a transaction which was by far the worst board decision in Rite Aid's history.I have information into The Wall St. Journal, hoping they pick up this story, and the Republican administration closeness to the senior executives of Cerberus.  I believe this is an important story, notwithstanding that normally The FTC would approve 2 companies in different industries.  However, this case is anything but normal, where the eventual outcome for this merger has ""bankruptcy"" written all over it.  The long delay in a decision on the first merger offer, together with pulling the offer just days before, a Confidentially Agreement between Rite Aid and Albertsons in September 2017, giving perhaps entities friendly to Cerberus 5 months to drop the Rite Aid stock price are all examples of an irregularity that should peek the interest of a (right) judge, if we ever get there.  I can assure you that is what I am pushing for, but it is not my decision.Additionally, this week I will be notifying The SEC, indeed reminding them, about the unethical conduct already allowed or engaged in by Miller and Standley, that I would like in the definitive proxies.  Voting shareholders have a right to know about the conduct of executives that want to get back together again, whose prior behavior, raiding the corporate vault, was never in the interest of their shareholders and only in their own personal interest. Finally, I believe this is the kind of story for an investigative television reporter and I have 2 reporters in mind that this will go into next week.  So, I will continue to be ""a busy little beaver"".Chin up folks, I can only hope my attorney will file a Complaint again; this time with plenty of information on the lack of a fair offer, and a failure of the board to adequately meet their fiduciary responsibilities, the 2 areas that the Court would examine.  We are fortunate to have the very recent Walgreens sale as the best arbitrator of what a ""fair"" offer is.  It has to be a ""fair"" sale, not any sale.  It does not have to be a sale at all.  The board has already demonstrated numerous examples of not meeting their responsibility to their shareholders, so a pattern of wrongful conduct is already available for examination.  Again, their claiming there was no one else to sell to (which may be false anyway, given the poison pill) is not the test, if remaining independent would actually have been a better decision on the part of the board. The Cerberus/Republican administration angle in my mind is very significant, and if we get to Court (not assured yet) let's hope we get a sympathetic judge; it wouldn't hurt if he was a Democrat, too.  A separate examination on whether investors were provided material information in a timely way could also be under review, as it is fairly apparent that Rite Aid ""kept too much under their hat"" instead of releasing it, which could be considered ""material"".",

If they do, the deal would be big: Humana currently has a market value of about $37 billion.It would be Walmart’s largest deal by far, eclipsing its 1999 acquisition of the U.K.’s Asda Group PLC for $10.8 billion. Walmart, which in addition to being the world’s biggest retailer is also a big drugstore operator, has a market value of about $260 billion.The two companies are discussing a range of options, including an acquisition, one of the people familiar said.Should there be a deal—and should regulators and shareholders bless it—it would transform Walmart overnight into one of the nation’s largest health insurers. It would immerse the company in a complicated industry, one that continues to evolve eight years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted and as Washington remains deeply divided over health-care policy.The talks come as health-service providers are rapidly pairing off and retailers—particularly pharmacy chains—are looking to diversify and bulk up in the face of the competitive threat from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inchttps://on.wsj.com/2GV...",

"IMO - RAD problem is primarily incompetent, crooked, dishonest, shifty, untrustworthy management. Even if RAD makes 1% net profit on 30B revenue its 300MM and nothing to scoff at.Common shareholders need to focus on removing CEO/BOD and crony capitalism culture around them. On its own RAD will survive. As seem by current inflationary talk - RAD inventory, property they own and reduced debt cost will all add up to tangible positive to bottom line.Bringing in white knight is uncalled for. RAD has to pare down debt, get rid of management and show customers it can serve a role in market it serves. Share price will double/triple as WS starts trusting. We don't want any more dogs with fleas and pimps pretending to be care takers.Yes, competition is severe - however, nothing can be far from truth that even gas stations and fast food joins run profitable operations. Fear mongering on same topic - sky is falling - totally uncalled for. Its a TimesUp# movement what we need for RAD.There is definitely breach of trust when it comes to CEO & even BOD compensations. Year after year - bad performance, bad M&A, failed M&A and failed purchases -- Yet no consequences - This is possible because shifty operators are in charge. Their compensation package is making them do even more of the same. BOD and role is a sham with self serving agenda. Btw, some folks here have repeated song there is no hope or that brilliant on management side -- it speaks volume of that posters character as to what he/she will do in the situation - and its scary - the trolls on SA are equal to Fake news trolls and crafty election meddlers - who thrive on derailing core agenda - GET RID OF MANAGEMENT - partly because I firmly believe - spreading negative talks about how RAD management is bad yet brilliant, how they are unethical still smart - its playing to hands of shorts.Be aware of the folks who are criticizing  posts from say Steve - they are paid trolls, shorts or worst yet - scumbags who want the nominal position (say 100 long shares to CYA for SEC sake) and talk persistently defeatist talk - weakening thread.

"Catalyst7When you get right down to it, Rite Aid is a convenience business, and has been anything but convenient, and has failed to target products based on the needs of the individual communities in which they serve.  Indeed, Kermit Crawford, President of Rite Aid recently, made a comment that he wanted to target products to the needs of his customers,  Hopefully, this was not a throw away line.  By way of example, in Atlantic City in 2003, the store manager took me over to the wall of cosmetics, and said, Steve, you see this whole wall of cosmetics, 90% of them are meant for white women, and as you know Atlantic City residents are 90% ethnic.  We do not sell any of these cosmetics.  I replied ""does the district manager know about this"".  Answer ""Absolutely.  Fast forward now to 2012, same store, new manager who has no idea of the past comment made to me, and again brings up the same issue, with middle management fully aware with no resolution.  Indeed, around 2005-2006, I personally brought up this issue to Mary Sammons and Standley in 2008, but unfortunately ""nobody home"".So, Rite Aid is a convenience business that is anything but convenient.  When you short staff the store, so that the lone cashier has to leave a line of 6 people waiting to check-out, so that the cashier can run over to the ice cream parlor to scoop ice cream for those customers waiting too long, maybe you lose both sets of customers in the future.Rite Aid's extra stores, quick in and out of the parking lot, and a more personable staff (which they do not have in too many instances) is the reason that stores like Rite Aid, walgreens and CVS could still strive.  CVS and Walgreens pay more attention to the convenience factors, and Standley gets away with making believe he provides that.  His stores are more empty than the other two, so he may be fooling shareholders but the customers are voting with their feet!  Solve the legendary ""corporate culture"" issues at Rite Aid and shareholders will make money, and so much more than the few crumbs some here are salivating for by either wanting to accept this current offer, o r a few dollars more by someone else today.",

"stocks24me,When Walmart started selling limited amounts of groceries years ago, they established the business model of ""Every Day Low Prices"". Since then especially in their Superstores they expanded into a full line of groceries, fresh vegetables / fruit, deli, bakery, meats, dairy, frozen foods, paper goods, and yes prescriptions and vitamins. Grocery now accounts for over 50% of Walmart's revenue numbers. Every Day Low Prices means no weekly price changes (up or down) based on advertised sales flyers. Walmart made the conscious effort to accept lower margins and increase gross sales, thus expanding scale. I can shop at Walmart for select grocery items at prices that are lower than any other grocery chain and use manufacturers coupons.Beat that pricing. When other grocery chains have weekly sales, those sales prices may match Walmart's, they may be slightly less or slightly more but only for 1 week. As a shopper I find the weekly sales flyers helpful but they are a pain in the butt to keep up with. Imagine the labor costs involved in changing several hundred prices to match the sales flyers?Every Day Low Prices has allowed Walmart to capture market share away from the grocery store chains. CVS, Walgreen's, RAD all sell limited grocery items but do not using an every day low price business model, Target does have every day low prices on limited groceries and have weekly ads / flyers that include only a small amount of select grocery sale items. Target grocery sales only account for approx. 5% of gross revenue. They all issue weekly ads / flyers and have to change prices every week. Except Walmart they all have loyalty cards that offer discounts based on your accumulated purchases over the course of the year. Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods gained access to the middle to upper income group of grocery store shoppers. Did you know that Costco works on a business model of 15% profit margins? Costco has been for years. Costco relies on the annual membership card fee's (loyalty) and bulk sales, as their products tend to be much larger in size.I don care what type of discount plan WBA has offered RAD, They both should not be in the grocery store business. If WBA / RAD really want to compete their they should consider establishing evrry day low prices on thier limited grocery item. Due to Walmart's / Targets scale, they will never win this war. CVS has realized this, thus that is one reason why they are in the process of merging with Aetna, a health insurance company.RAD needed a visionary to aggressively expand into health screening services which require a bricks and mortar visits and increase foot traffic, an area that Amazon cannot compete with at this time. Health screening services would also account for a higher average ticket price per customer. RAD is too far behind the curve before CVS and WBA figure this out. This is how you compete with the threat of Amazon. RAD and Albertson's need to drastically change their business models in order to survive. With a RAD / ABS combination you could say it may be similar to what Target is, except swap out the full grocery line (ABS) for soft / hard goods (TGT). How is selling soft / hard goods, prescriptions (CVS in stores) / vitamins and select groceries working out for Target?We welcome your thoughts and opinions but it does deviate away from the topic of this board, Appraisal Rights Litigation.",

"Xeranda / ablewalker09 /  Steve Krol / PTL,Years ago when RAD starting selling groceries it was a great idea, it increased gross sales, allowed for pharmacy customer cross selling and worked for a while.When Walmart started selling groceries under its everyday low price model and now Amazon has entered the grocery business with its purchase of Whole Foods, the writing was on the wall. RAD was going to be like a salmon swimming upstream to lay her fish eggs.Due to RADs heavy debt and lack of scale they are trying to compete by selling products against fierce competitors who have scale and the financial means to pivot and grow.One area that RAD could have competed in that CVS, WBA have done little of and that Amazon cannot is in health services. There are various types of health services which require a brick and mortar location than Amazon does not have. Think RediClinic inbedded in RAD stores or very close by but offering expanded health services options beyond what CVS / WBA clinics currently offer. I say RAD ""could have"" because it is to late to start as they shrink store locations and deal with debt management.Fast forward to the today and now. Maybe we have been looking at RAD all wrong.Yes RAD has very limited options in finding another bidder.Yes trying to squeeze blood out of an Albertsons stone is very limited.Yes competition is fierce in CVS / AET, WBA, Walmart and Amazon looming and these guys are all getting stronger.Some have said CEO Standley is a deal maker and not a good manager or visionary.There is an old saying some times the sum of parts are worth more than the whole.Maybe the better option we should all consider if there is consensus is, we find us a White Knight or facilitator not to pony up money to try and force a higher price but consider whether RAD is worth more in parts versus the remaining whole.Standley was able to sell off 1,900+ stores to WBA for a great per store price.Whats left?Sell the remaining 2,569 stores to some of the other competitors, CVS, WBA, Walmart or other whether they keep them open rebranded or close them.Sell the RediClinics to one of the other competitors, CVS, WBA, Walmart or other.Sell HealthDialog to one of the other competitors or other.Sell the PBM to one of the other competitors, CVS, WBA, Walmart, another PBM or an insurance company.    .Would selling the parts off separately yield more than the outstanding debt left after the RAD store sales to WBA are complete?By recruiting a White Knight type like Carl Icahn or Paul Singer who understand business, understand value and have deep contacts to open up the eyes of the current or new BOD and speak about the reality of RADs future be able to convince them that selling the parts is better than going down the slow road to bankruptcy under Albertson's work?I know this idea is disruptive but when you bring in an expert to evaluate, present and persuade that maximizes value for all shareholders, it needs to be discussed and strongly considered here.Lets here your Pros and Cons.Thanks",

"Steve Krol,I think you are right in pointing out the poison pill event. It very well could have been the instrument of destruction, the trigger that was put in place knowing that the Cerberus / Albertsons deal was in the waiting. I fail to see how it was some form of protection for RAD's stock price.I do not expect you to answer all of the following questions. I am just trying to stimulate thought and ideas from you and the other posters on the poison pill event and real purpose.Has CEO Standley ever indicated the reason for the poison pill?If not, has he ever been asked that question?If not, would it be possible to get one or more analysts that covers RAD to ask this question during the next earnings conference call?It would be important to get Standley or his CFO on the record for evidence purposes when working with your Attorney.Has the poison pill created financial harm for shareholders in the form of a decreasing stock price?Can it be shown that the poison pill benefited one or more parties, such as, RAD employee Standley? large organized short sellers? others?When will the poison pill expire?How important will the poison pill date expiration play with upcoming events, such completion as RAD store / warehouses transfer to WBA, debt repurchase using WBA money, earnings report, proxy filing release, etc.?Thank You for the consideration.",
"Steve Krol and Prospect Theory, thanks for your work on this. I picked up 200k shares during the past week or so. I may add more if it stays under 1.50. I will support any effort to stop this b.s. deal.",
"Looked at RAD Dark Pool history of last 3 months. I didn't see the signs of institutions dumping their shares. DPI has been between 45-65%, in last 4 weeks with more net buying. My limit price buy order was triggered yesterday. Remember last time the Amazon fear caused stock price tumbling from $2 to $1.38. On last day of that tumbling, it went from $1.54 to $1.38 suddenly with no apparent reason, only to make a sharp U turn to close green. I'm still on the sideline, because my capital is tied up in 3 other more intense devil stocks: EKSO, DCIX and INPX. All waiting on near term catalysts, all very disappointing in price actions and people hate and suing management. Market can just be very unfair about valuation. For example, with book value near 14× of current share price being stated again and again in SEC filing, share price can still keep dropping nonstop on daily basis for months long. We just have to be vigilant and agile in this irrational danger waters.",
"Steve Krol, Carl Icahn is a corporate governance champion. Carl dislikes bad management including BOD's. RAD and Standley have painted a real bright target on their backs screaming for Carl Icahn to take notice. Carl may just be what retail investor needs as an activist. Carl would only have to accumulate few hundred million shares to get the attention and force action here. Will you consider reaching out to Carl Icahn? Can you imagine Paul Singer and Carl Icahn as a tag team?Thank You for the consideration.",
"It will interesting to see how the RAD institutional holdings change after March 2018 quarter end. i believe we will not learn until approx. 45 days (mid May) after quarter end. June 2018 quarter end will not report until mid August, most likely after RAD reverse merger vote. Who sold, who added. Given they have to take tax gain / loses into consideration, they may have decided to average down now, knowing that the short interest will have to cover eventually. If they decide to sell off to shorts now, why would they sell lower? Large institutions usually make block trades on big price spikes / dips which we are not having at the moment. The release of the proxy is most likely the next significant price movement event.Any insights on the large institutional holders trading psychology would be welcome here. We are only minnows in the big sea of stock trading activity, but can be nimble.    Thanks",
"It's simply absurd that RAD shareholders #1 concern is that our CEO and BOD is trying to steal the value of the company in conjunction with PE.  We've forgotten about operations, possible improvements, etc...  the normal concerns of shareholders that would increase the value and performance of the company.Instead, it's all about stopping management from screwing those it is supposed to work for.  This is a lesson in corporate governance I won't forget.  Buffet was right.  Invest in companies with good management.   Not in companies run by those who should be case studies in corporate ethics classes.I can assure you there will be a book written by someone on the destruction of Rite Aid.",
"Catalyst7Thanks for your comment.  He was not on my radar until now.  However, i will contact him now and see where it goes , if anywhere.  They are very secretive in their actions, so as most, if he is even vaguely interested in responding, it would be to bring him up to speed on the gross mismanagement of the company, which would afford him ""to escavate this goldmine"" by taking a position.  Remember, Walgreens had already purchased all stores in Las Vegas and San Francisco in 2008 and 2009; believe me you do not want to know what I eyes saw there in those two towns prior to Walgreens purchase.  Do I have any doubt that Walgreens made lemonade out of those 2 lemons?  No doubt at all, and now Walgreens came back for more in 2015, how about acquiring all the stores, but stopped apparently by The FTC.It is my ethical position, that I will not report any comments that an interested party may make to me here, or anywhere else for that matter.",
"What RAD shareholders need is a ""Golden White Knight' in the form of Paul Singer of Elliott Management. Singer is an absolute bulldog, especially if he thinks the target is being severely under valued. Singer is excellent at uncovering hidden value in any company or deal he invets money in. Singer would need to begin accumulating a decent percentage of RAD common stock to establish a notable position soon. We do not know if he would be willing to do battle with a fellow hedge fund in Cerberus. As a previous poster mentioned, Albertsons could not afford to raise its offer for all RAD shareholders so you may not favor this approach unless you want to try and blow up the RAD reverse merger process completely. Would you consider reaching out to Paul Singer? If so, please let us know what his response was. Thank You for the consideration.",
no vote long rad,
"Please do your research on appraisal. If you had been keeping up with recent rulings (Dell, Aruba, etc) you would know your valuation methodologies are irrelevant.",
Rick39 I did believe a white knight would come in and Bail out Rite Aid. I did figure there was a private equity firm that would see this as a juicy opportunity.I also thought that Amazon would want the PBM.  But I didn’t figure that John Standley and the board would screw the shareholders so badly.   So perhaps I should keep my day job flipping burgers at McDonald’s and not in verse every nickel I have into loser stocks like Rite Aid.,
"As far as delivering a written appraisal demand, how does the date of purchase, as long as it is before the vote, affect shareholder rights?  So one could, in theory, buy the day before the shareholder vote and deliver the demand to RAD before the vote?I ask this because I've been chipping away for a few pennies here and there by selling and buying back my shares.  No idea how low this is going, but I'd be surprised to see it get below $1.35.  That, of course, is just my guess.   I'm sure management is tickled to death to see long term shareholders sell off and give up.  They are complicit with what's happening to share price.  My experience with RAD has been a real eye opener as far as how little protection shareholders have from unethical management.",

To my knowledge no small investor has been successful using this strategy. The Dell case initially passed the lower courts but the Supreme Court overturned that ruling. Icahn, a Dell shareholder prior to the takeover, was smart enough to not bother with Appraisal Rights. The deal is not done yet. It is amazing that investors have not revolted against the BOD and management.",

How is Cerberus going to squeeze more money out of ABS and now RAD?.. It seems they won't make much through the common as it may fall to levels to low after the lock up period..

"The government will not stop this deal. Cerberus founder, billionaire Feinberg has served in the Trump administration and is a major Republican donor. Sadly while he is a billionaire, he has not been as good to his investors or the companies that he has acquired. Just take a look at the bankruptcies he has left behind throughout his career. Well, what do you expect? He got his start at Drexel Burnham, an investment bank that went bankrupt and was accused of illegal activity. It is a shame that some people make millions out of bankruptcies. You could argue that what is fair is fair and they are ultimately playing by the rules. That is true but the ethics of these deals are questionable. I doubt that RAD shareholders will be able to stop this deal. I am sure Cerberus has structured the deal in a way that has incentivized RAD management to assure that the deal goes through. So will we have a marriage of two crappy companies that will ultimately screw shareholders and thousands of employees? I don't know, but it is certainly not done yet. Perhaps a White Knight will emerge. It is really sad that the government stopped the Walgreens merger because that would have been good for the economy, shareholders and employees ultimately. Now the government is just going to watch as these two loser companies with loads of debt merge and eventually file for bankruptcy. Don't worry about the PE founders though. They will continue making millions. They will issue more bonds and dump it on the dumb money (ie: mutual funds that retail investors invest in) and then give themselves a huge dividend.

To authorPlease disclose if you went to law school.,
Ok.. Since I think that this deal doesn't go through in its current form I went ahead and put my money where my mouth is and bought a couple of shares at $1.50 either that or I just bought ABS at $13.. I'm getting my $2.50 as Standley promised right?..  facetious I am..,
"Author is bringing up some very relevant points here in my view.   I should add that the basis for arguing a higher valuation could be enhanced by the amount that CVS paid Target for its script files and that the liquidation value of RAD is likely much higher than what was assumed in the exchange ratio and the 28% share of mergeco given to RAD shareholders. Anybody who owns RAD shares and decidees to join a ""group"" to file a case for an independent valuation, however, has to be very careful.  Don;t blindly join uip with someone who miight have motives other than your interest in mind or has a long track record of criticing management because the courts or independent directors migh ignore such a loud and frequent complainer.  Mr Krol thinks he might be helping people, but in reality he could worsen their case because of a long documented history with RAD and attending shareholder meetings.  Krol is not going to be viewed as unbiased.   Don't follow any pied pipers.Hopefully the independent directors will ask for another appraisal unconnected to Citibank.  They might be forced to do this if enough legitimate shareholders request it in ordrer to avoid post closing litigtion.",

Sadly I really thought that the company was moving forward in a positive manner after its FTC debacle.  I held on with the belief that management was aligned with running the business and that the Poison pill the board put into place would see the company through to a better time.   How wrong was I for thinking  that Management was interested in stabilizing Rite Aid until a better deal could move it to a better place.   John Standley and the board screwed the shareholder who held on to Rite Aid shares.  Over the last 24 months I had averaged down and fortunately sold before the end of 2017 my highest cost shares which I offset these losses with some nice gains on other positions.   I was not smart enough to totally disengage from Rite Aid.   I Averaged down and kept buying cheaper shares with the hope of one day seeing $5.00 or $6.00 in value.  Again I was very wrong.  You see management of Rite Air were nothing but a bunch of WHORES who got free shares for screwing the common shareholder.   The deal with Cererbus is nothing more than a way for Cererbus to get their cash out of Albertson's which is a hodgepodge of failed grocery stores.   Standley who couldn't run Rite Aid will become the COO of the new entity.  This to me sounds like a future bankruptcy in the next 24 to 36 months after Cererbus has left the station with their capital and profit.  Rite Air becomes part of a failing Grocery chain that has too many names and various business operating companies to be a viable operation.   I sold all my shares at $1.78 as in my opinion as a retail investor is that the market will punish the IPO and the new entity will be at a big disadvantage out the gate. Lies Lies & Lies is about all an investor in Rite Aid can expect today and moving forward.   What did the board and Standley know back in December 2017 when they put the poison pill agreement together.   They had to know about the Cererbus deal at that time and put the poison pill in place.  I would be happy to participate in a Class action as it seems that shareholders were royally screwed.,
No means no.   Rad me 2.,
"Prospect Theory LabsThank you for an interesting angle to consider, however, there is an additional option that few here consider, and even yourself forgot to include as a fourth option:keep your shares, hope The FTC refuses to approve the deal OR the Vote is a ""NO""                                                   ANDthe company remains independent, Standley is ousted by the existing board (because they finally have to, not because they want to) or activist will finally come in, grab seats and show Standley the door)Shareholders should also be reminded that lawyers awaiting the proxies for vital information to determine whether they should proceed with a Class-Action lawsuit, will automatically determine whether the offer is fair to shareholders and whether the board PROPERLY exercised their fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders (and not to Standley and themselves only).  The costs of a class action ,  would automatically be borne by the lawyers, because they are hoping for large fees awarded to them by the Court , if they are successful.  All existing shareholders would be part of the class.Nice angle though, in your article.  Obviously, a class-action would cover what you are suggesting, I believe.  Lets see what the proxies reveal, keeping in mind that the 2 parties already know this deal has significant hurdles to get over and the proxies will likely be worded to their benefit.  But facts are facts, and I can guarantee all readers here that you will see a statement in big block letters indicating the ""INTERESTS OF THE PRINCIPALS INVOLVED MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN YOUR OWN "".  Now, that's definitely 100% true.",
I am ready to join any litigation. Instead of saying no and posting in SA if we can join some litigation it will add some value.,
Happy I took RAD behind the barn for $1.97 and was done with this dead money pooch on the final day of trading last year. Only thing it served for in my portfolio was for the losses to offset my gains for last year. Thanks RAD.,
If this hack job of a deal goes through i will be selling my albertsons stock immediately and then shorting albertions to recoup my money.... albertsons is swimming in debt and will get crushed that is almost a certainty,

"“Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (NYSE: DPS) is expected to be subsumed by Keurig Green Mountain in July.

While price reductions accelerated K-cup volume growth, the metrics of gross margins, net sales, gross profit and operating income fell in the six months preceding March.“We think the six month results look a lot like Zero Based Budgeting in the ninth inning: major cost cuts drive strong operating income growth, followed by a need for organic revenue growth to drive operating income growth,” the analysts wrote in a note.Additionally, higher interest expense and lower Keurig Green Mountain forecasts together justify a drop in pro forma estimates.“We recently reduced DPS forecasts for higher packaging and logistics costs, and the more we learn about Keurig Green Mountain, the more we are convinced it has limited capacity for operating income growth,” the analysts wrote.”.....6/19/2018",
Yes.  I bought CSG when it owned DPS.The interesting thing is DPS was spun off at the worst possibld time...deep in the heart of the Great Recession.  Those who held on and added along the way have been rewarded,

"Hi Chad Brand - I agree with you that Dr. Pepper Snapple is attractive in the $116-$118 range.  The $0.60 annual dividend from ""NewCo"" Keurig Dr. Pepper helps put a floor on how low shares should trade, and the new management team has demonstrated a willingness and ability to pay down debt, as evidenced by Keurig's rapid deleveraging over the last few years.  However, I would point out, that while the tax situation hasn't been explicitly spelled out, the special dividend will likely be classified as a ""return of capital,"" and rather than triggering a taxable event, will simply lower the tax basis on the new shares.  The dividend isn't being paid out of retained earnings or profits, but rather out of debt incurred by JAB and their partners.  That's how the Kraft Heinz merger played, out a few years ago (Excerpt from Frequently Asked Questions Regarding the Tax Consequences of the Kraft-Heinz Transaction):""As a consequence, it is expected that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the special dividend, the merger and the subsequent merger will be treated as a single integrated transaction that will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.""Of course, until Dr. Pepper issues their own guidance, I would approach buying shares in a taxable account with caution.  I am not a tax expert, but based on past cases, this is my best guess at how the situation will play out.",Keurig-Dr Pepper: Significant Upside If Management Delivers On Merger Objectives

"Spread sheet jockeying has proven to be a very unsuccessful approach to predicting where VRX is heading for the past 2 years...so for bankruptcy risk I prefer to just go by what the major bond rating agencies are saying. Moodys rates VRX bonds as Caa1; the 10 year default rate for bonds with this rating is ~40%. S&P rates them a notch higher at B-, corresponding to B3 in Moodys rating scheme. The 10 year default rate at that rating is a bit under 30%. So VRX BK risk in the next 10 years is in the region 30-40% according to this. A big risk, but the risk/reward is still very favorable at the current sp level IMHO. Whenever i point this out (as I've done countless times already in the past), someone always starts going on about the credit agencies being garbage since they were totally wrong about mortgage-backed securities back in 2008. Well that was a one-off situation that almost everyone got wrong. Valeant's situation on the other hand - a semi-busted roll-up - is nothing new; the credit agencies have plenty of experience evaluating these. If the credit agencies really are garbage then there would be no correlation between the ratings they assign and the 10 year default rates of the rated companies.

Back in 2H 2015 the guidance was for $7.5B. In the Q2 2016 ER Papa guided to $4.8B ebitda for 2016 and forecast ~$5B for 2018, and this was taking LOEs into account... And now we are looking at maybe $3.2B for 2018... A whole lot of rot/underperformance vs expectations...Will it finally stop now? I believe it will stop and reverse at some point, but whether we are at that point now is anyones guess. A lot like tying to predict the earnings of oil or mining companies during the oil&metals crash - depends on when and where the price of oil & base metals will bottom.There is a saying in the mining industry ""Low prices is the cure for low prices"". I believe something similar holds in specialty & generic pharma. Companies cut back on drug development while they focus on repairing their balance sheets, means fewer new drugs appearing in future and hence recovering pricing power for the existing ones.When oil was crashing people talked about $30 oil as the new normal. Similarly, people are now assuming there has been a permanent reset in the pricing power of specialty & generic pharmas. It is probably just the low point of a cycle though, just like it proved to be in oil & mining. But whether we are at the bottom yet is anyones guess...",

"How about a trade war with China?  Is that enough to bring down Valeant?  Bausch & Lomb, the “stable” part of Valeant’s revenue, Bausch & Lomb which accounts for most of Valeant’s revenue, Bausch & Lomb that makes contact lenses, and so popular in China that Chinese call lenses something like Baushis after Bausch & Lomb.If Chinese place a 35% tariff then VRX share price will crash to new lows.  Valeant is Canadian, but many of its products are made in USA.  So this threat is real, and I held off on adding to my VRX stake today even at $15.37.With Chinese trade war that Trump unleashed the $60 billion trade war will not end with $3 billion China is threatening to retaliate on American pork, and steel pipes.  This development without further escalation in my opinion might be enough to reprice VRX to $14.80 (sub $15).  Will add to VRX position next week if share price dives around that price.Nice write up, thank you for the article.",
The majority of their debt is fixed no?,
"Fair article, it is safe to say Valeant will not go bk any time soon if ever.  There is always asset sales (which I seriously doubt they will ever do) and shelf offering (very likely in the 2-3 year time frame).The main problem with all these bull thesis is that FCF & EBITDA calculations and projections just DOESN'T WORK when you are valuing a pharma.  When the uber bulls finally understand this, if ever, they will understand why VRX is trading where it is.Look at what happened to ABBV, see how much market cap they have lost just due to a single bad result from a study... look at CELG and what happened to that stock recently from pipeline failures.  Both these companies generate tremendous FCF & EBITDA, yet a single failed study can wipe out 10-20% their valuation.With CELG nobody is concerned about their FCF or EBITDA now, only focus for investors is Revlimid and the upcoming patent expiration, how are they going to replace the looming lost revenue?  That's why so much of their valuation is riding on the pipeline and clinical study results and not what FCF or EBITDA they are generating now.So it is also with ABBV with their cancer trial...With VRX their FCF and EBITDA now DOES NOT MATTER !!!  How will they replace LOE, in particular Xifaxan, because eventually it will lose it's patent.  Siliq, Vyzulta are not it, at least from what I have seen so far.  What else do they have?  Just reformulations, different dosage forms, combo drugs in the pipeline.  Do they have something revolutionary like a CART-T therapy?  An entirely new molecule with a new MOA?  There is nothing... this is what you need to know to see why VRX is trading where it is.Once and for all, PLEASE stop the FCF and EBITDA calculations because that is barking up the wrong tree. VRX is what I would call a ""zombie stock"", only exists so that bond holders can collect their interest.  There is no innovation here, and with no innovation there is no future.",
"Good article. Long term future looks bright, IMO. I am predicting a drift in VRX to $14 area by around mid-May, then resumption of upward trend to just over $29 by mid or late July before another pullback to a higher low than $14, barring any very major news of course.",

"Good article; however, I think you might have made the same mistake I made in my first VRX valuation article double counting the affects of debt by subtracting both interest payments and net debt. On the flip side I think the bear case is more like there's still downside to EBITDA and there is no recovery just a flat line at ~$3B or less that would require a massively dilutive equity capital raise at some point maybe even BK if they break covenants or can't roll the debt over.",

"Excellent article. both in the premise and your execution. Thank you for putting in the hard work to do this.

"""What will it take to bring Valeant to bankruptcy or into a forced buyout?"" I'm not sure Papa is the type that would forced into a buyout.

Great article.  Don't forget the Canadian banks.,

Don't underestimate the last. Canadian banks are profitable, pay good dividends -- in the 4 percent ""range"" -- and well capitalised; but for those trying to ""pick"" which bank to bet on for price appreciation, look into their asset composition (a reflection of their strategy), asset quality, the risks, and the mitigants.

"DoctorxLet's focus on that dividend. You wrote:""This article goes through several key considerations in valuing ABBV and finds it interesting as a potentially undervalued stock with a seemingly secure dividend above 4%.""Seemingly secure dividend above 4%?S&P's CFRA analysis says that insider trading is considered HIGH.CFRA also states that the stock at $94 is 23% overvalued.I pose this question: Why if the dividend is one of the highest in the sector, above 4%, are ABBV directors selling the stock?The insiders, that is, the directors of the company are privy to the finances of the company. For them to have massive selling is very questionable. Selling by insiders while raising the dividend is bordering on unethical. Yes I said UNETHICAL.There are some warning signs here and those warning signs must be discussed.",

"Doctoro: Excellent research report, with an interesting slant on your part. The massive loss in market cap was only in part due to Rova- T,  and to a large extent due to the 700 pt drop in the DOW, and the S&P breaking support. That said, ABBV's valuationgot as high as $195B, by far larger than MRK, AZN,BMY, LLY, etc. Certainly the largest Biotech Co. in the world. They do arguably have the best pipeline in all Biotech, and management led by Rick Gonzalesis excellent.  I strongly agree with with your holding the position. In mynew career, I have been working with ABBV and you get a better feelfor the company, than listening to earnings calls, or presentations atHealth Care conferences in the capacity of a HF manager. The company is superbly run and Rick has multiple options. Restructuring among them.I don't envision a Bear Market, but believe we are in  a big correction re-testing the prior Feb lows. I am looking at stellar earnings for this Q. Biotech has recently knocked off huge market cap from GILD,CELG,BIIB, REGN, TSRO, INCY et al. This too shall pass, as the fore mentioned firms will recover very nicely in the next few years. I would name CELG as my number one pick. I would view AABV as a name I'd like in my portfolio. My kudos to management has one caveat, and that is the acquisition price of Rova-T with such a huge premium. I haven't written it off as they still have two other PH III trials on going and several other indications in the wings. I still believe ABBV is a great stock , but may be purchased after the market does whatever it decides to do. Thanks again for such a well crafted piece.",
"Thx Doc for another excellent article. I obviously am in the minority here. It is this incessant valuation worry that I largely do not take a part in. What is it worth? I don’t know. 22x’s. No your crazy! 17x max! No way the pipeline, the debt. Here is my thing. I look at mkt cap. I ask myself, what large cap but not mega cap bio, has the best chance of joining the mega cap club. Knowing, obviously, there will Elbe failures all along the way. Every company has them. But I see a firm hellbent on bringing value to its shareholders with a divy JNJ can be jealous of. Have never been a fan of the in and out game. I understand over time, shareholders went from averaging 6 yrs holding s stock to 6 months. Back in the day it was “well it’s a strong company”. Now it’s “too highly valued, too leveraged, compared to the S&P, interest rates, fed policy, Russia, Syria, bird flu, black lives matter, Twitter, inflation, recession, the yield curve, Dow Transport Theory” and whatever else is today’s fancy. Perhaps I am the ultimate simpleton. I just like holding strong companies. I also have notified, the finer I try to be with my timing, the worst my results. And the attempt to time is merely the fear of buying something and watching the price decline. There is NO way to determine what time is most optimal. You could have bought Abbvie at 121 and it could have kept running another 20 pts. They could have announced some solid bolt on acquisitions and raised the divy yet again! I follow mngmt. I commit to being in which means I don’t have to obsessive over valuations. I pay attention for the sake of doing so. It does not drive my buying decisions. Opportune times on a chart are a better indication. Well rant done, be well",
"Thank you for this nice posting on ABBV.  This is a stock I have owned for many years, much of the time when it was part of ABT.  I have always been happy with its performance which I think will continue in the future",
"Thanks for a nice write-up as always Doc.  I've never had must interest in ABBV as an investment but still love to keep up with the industry overall.  This silly market has so many spoiled and has for some time, but of course many have been cautiously optimistic for some time as well.  The contrarians of us here at SA have been unpopular for some time, as markets has continued to set new highs and make more historic runs.  The thought of holding cash/dry powder has been seen by some as totally unacceptable, especially with historically low interest rates.  I for one don't think the sky is falling but a correction of 20% or more won't shock me, and unfortunately is necessary to bring this unhealthy explosion of valuations to an end.  Fundamentals simply don't match prices in many instances, FANG stocks being the perfect example.  Sure most are great companies and should continue to be, but what an investor is paying for future earnings/cash flow right now is ridiculous.I've even spoken to older folks, my parents included, who seem to expect this 9 year bull market to continue for another 9 years!  The more of this kind of thinking I run into, the more cautious I become.  That said, I do think there are values in this market, especially in biotech, increasingly pharma, MLPs, aggregates/commodities and REITs, especially for those with 10+ year holding periods.I'm now focusing on my 'Best of Breed' list with ever increasing interest.  It's certainly better to wait and purchase great companies at more reasonable prices than we've seen in ages.  Otherwise even investments in great companies can produce below average returns if the prices paid are too high.",
"Correction: Amgen Humira biosimilar to hit US market in Jan 2023, not Jan 2022 as in your article. That extra year is worth a lot of $. Other than that nice article. I think the reaction here was way overblown and ABBV under $100 is a good price going forward. I wasn't banking much on Rova-T for future growth projections, and even if the entire asset is dead with a $5.8B sunk cost, the revenue growth over the next few years should still be spectacular. Humira patent loss is still worrisome for the long-term, but ABBV is masterclass in drug commercialization, and if the approval of upa and riza pan out I trust ABBV to get the most out of them.",

"Thanks as always for your analysis. According to Factset, profits are expected to grow 11.8% in aggregate for companies in the S&P 500. Net profit margins are expected to be 10.9%, the highest in 10 years. Analysts tend to overestimate profits growth and it seems a tough ask for margins to expand when I read of higher costs in a number of industries. The key is whether investors will accept high valuations because profits growth is robust.

I too am long ABBV and was (past tense) concerned about it's moderately high valuation before the news, primarily because of the price/sales ratio being at an all time high (5.5+). and it's PE of 19.6. In the 98-99 range it's now closer to 16. You also mentioned the debt/capital load which they have been instrumental in reducing from 87% in 6/17 to a current 72%. There are, indeed, many unknowns in this well managed (IMO) A rated company, however given it's projected 15-18% earnings growth rate, I feel it is now very rationally priced.",
"@DoctorRX:Good article. I agree with you on valuations - it is harder to find stocks at fair value. I have been in and out of ABBV and yesterday got back in just at the close.

Good article - thanks.,
Abbvie should have been acquired NBIX years ago instead of licensing out Elagolix,
ABBV has lingered in lower than true value status before based on overthinking the elements of its existence.

All the while the National Debt of $21 TRILLION + $20 TRILLION more missing from the Social Security Trust Funds and an additional $8 TRILLION more funds the Fed never matched the now retired Baby Boomer's Civil Service Retirement with an additional $1 Trillion more annually already spent for as far as the eye can see plus whatever additions they add with each new budget year puts this market truly at risk.My answer is that I'm sitting on my holdings thru all the dips as they should fare better than the cash in banks as more and more money is printed to fund this never ending debt habit.,

"Dr. Yaffe, Please read this article that connects the apoptosis cell death markers like K18 as a correlative index for PSC. As you know the DUR 928 has dramatically decreased these biomarkers as showed in the EASL presentation. So if we connect the dots the DUR 928 will have a pretty good shot with PSC n the long term. What do you think? I wish the management and the CEO gets aggressive with their partnership deals. Sad to see a drug with great potential is not in the news.May be by year end we may see something. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/...",
"Dr.Yaffe, There must be some preliminary results coming in with he initial enrollment on PSC trials because it is more that 4 weeks since the initiation. There are now six centers actively recruiting patients. clinicaltrials.gov/... The recent uptick in stock price 'may be' due to the anticipation of results. I am not sure . I am hoping and expecting some upside soon. What do you think? If only the Alkaline phosphatase comes to normal range and stays normal going forward then this stock price could easily double.Besides it will give some nice window to see the liver enzymes pattern too. I also think they are keeping the parenteral injection version of DUR 928 to themselves to use it as a major study in sepsis and CVA trials for the future.",
"Thank you for responding to my questions, Dr.Yaffe.",
"Dr.Yaffe,  What is your impression on the CC yesterday. The obvious fact is  Dr.Ren laid out the mechanism of multiple pathways  that the DUR 928 and has a clear advantage when it comes to treating NAFLD,  NASH and ASH overlap syndrome. It works on all the metabolic, inflammatory and fibrotic stages. I am very skeptical on the PSC . So far they are not saying anything about Alk.Phos data on the bile duct ligation animal studies. I wish someone asks them to find out the Alk phos data on the bile ligation models. What do you think?Also what is your take on the issuing of stocks ? Are they giving  it to some known buyers? I believe once they compile the phase 2 A&B studies by the end of the year they may partner with some big pharma, to further the study. I am cautiously optimistic.",
"Dr.Yaffe, Did you hear anything about DUR 928 from the EASL conference chat ? Did you happen to attend it? Thanks for your contribution.",
"If DUR 928 is a steroid analogue and has the unique anti inflammatory potential it should work well in many indications like Rheumatoid, collagen vascular disease and IBS . DUR 928 has shows to reduce fibrosis of liver in animal studies and so it may work on pulmonary fibrosis(unmet therapy) and keloid and other fibrotic diseases. It worked like a charm in acute organ injury in sepsis with multi organ failure in rats. I feel if they say is real then the sky is the limit for this drug. Why do you think if all this are real why the stock price is so low. Can you ask the CEO in the next CC why they have not patented this in all other conditions. Thanks for your insight.",
Thanks Dr.Yaffe . This above mentioned attachment I posted says the fact that NASH rapidly is overtaking hepatitis C as cause of liver cancer. You may already know about it. I think this is going to create a lot of attention on NASH and pressure on FDA to approve more drugs. DUR 928 appears to be an ideal candidate for the race.Hope the management will not stay behind in this race.,
Thanks.,
http://bit.ly/2qhepM3Dr.Yaffe what do you think? Will DUR-928 become a major player ? So far the animal studies are impressive.,
Here is a really good article explaining market opportunities / clinical efficacy for DUR-928.  Enjoy!http://bit.ly/2GDzRBp,
DRRX could have passed on Regeneron...  Why sell the rights with only P1b data for cheap when you potentially have a best in class molecule.  Listening to James Brown / CEO he definitely believes they have a winner in DUR-928.  My 2c,
If Regeneron passed DUR 928 itit was a bad mistake,
It Regeneron passed DUR 928 then it was a bad mistake. I am sure there are many big pharma watching the phase2 studies of DUR 928. From the animal studies it appears a sure winner. But Durect has failed its promise before like the posimir bupuvacaine data .,
"Good article.""It is worth noting that one of the pathways through which DUR-928 acts is SREBP-1c. Furthermore, DUR-928 would be taken orally for this indication.""NASH is such a complicated disease, so it is hard to say that SREBP-1 is one of the key culprits yet. Although Regeneron is new to NASH, my guess is that they have done their DD to DUR-928 and decided to pass.However, I am still long on DRRX. I got around 70 cents each last October, when I made the following comment at SA. Wish I bought more, a different kind of ""buyer's remorse"" :-)  ""At the end of June, Durect had approximately $33 million of cash, $20 million of which came from the payment by Sandoz for the rights in the US for Posimir. Then in September, Durect received $12.5 million from Indivior for their patent rights. It seems to me that these are smart deals without dilution.More importantly, Durect has a promising endogenous epigenetic regulator and analogue, DUR-928. Three Phase 1b studies have been completed for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic kidney disease, and Psoriasis.It could be a good time to buy for the risk takers.""20 Oct 2017, 11:19 AM  Edit/Delete",
"I found this in the patent area. It is about DUR 928 which is a sulfated Oxysterol called SULT2B1bhttp://bit.ly/2GRCpySI read from this patent details , ""To evaluate whether acute liver injury might influence the regeneration, serum AST, ALT and ALP levels were measured. Compared with Ad-Control infected mice group, strong decreases of AST, ALT and ALP serum levels in AdSULT2B1b infected mice were observed 1 or 3 days after PH (FIG. 32D-F), indicating SULT2B1b significantly decreased liver damage by suppressing inflammation responses. Thus, SUTL2B1b acts positively on liver proliferation after PH, both promoting the hepatocyte proliferation rate and exerting a specific reduction of acute liver injury.""Strong decrease in Alk pos(ALP) as well other enzymes.. That sounds really good for the PCS study.",
Yes that is what the mystery is. They have not said much about Alk phos in any of their previous human bioavailability tolerance studies. If (Big IF) it reduces the Alk Phos which is significantly elevated in PBC then this will be a game changer and the stock price will rocket to 5+ easily. In a few months the data may be available. But they wont reveal until the year end or completion of all follow up biomarker data.Until then we are at the mercy of PTIE an Indivor & FDA. Swings can happen. Long term I am hoping there should be at least one major positive data that will make the DUR 928 a wonder drug.,
"They mention alkaline phosphorus many times in their presentation and KOL call on PSC.  They refer to it as ALP which is the primary end-point for the PSC trial.KOL PSC Call:http://bit.ly/2E5CDwZALP (alkaline phosphorus) mentions in presentation:Page 19 – “STAM model and others: reduced ALP & hepatocyte nodule formation”Page 19 – “PSC may allow us to see a signal in 1 month using ALP”Page 20 – “ % change from baseline of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), other biomarkers”Page 20 – “ALP is an accepted proof-of-concept marker for PSC”Studies that support the trial:Bile duct ligation studySTAM modelP1b NASH P1b Chronic Kidney Amazing molecule!

"Here are the key points in the article on PSC that I have attached above.1. Serum K18 but not HMGB1 levels were increased in PSC and associated with severity of underlying liver disease and the degree of hepatocyte apoptosis.2. Analysis to examine the relationship between serum K18 and liver biochemistries in the PSC cohort showed that serum K18 levels significantly correlated with AST (r = 0.4, p-val = 0.016), Alk P (r = 0.5, p-val = 0.001), total bilirubin (r = 0.6, p-val =<0.001), and albumin (r = −0.4, p-val = 0.02)Now let us look at DUR 928 results in the previous data.1) EASL data showed,Exploratory biomarker analysis indicated a single oral dose of DUR-928 resulted reduction from baseline of both full-length and cleaved cytokeratin-18 (CK-18), IL18,hsCRP and bilirubin (Figures 1-5) in both cohorts. There was also a reduction of creatine kinase observed with DUR-928 dosing in both cohorts. Overall, there were'small or no changes' in serum liver enzymes, including ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP, aswell as in other biochemical markers. The lack of reduction in Alk.Phos is worry some.! But it a small data.2) They said in the last CC the decrease of cleaved CK-18 (a cell apoptosis marker) at 12 hours was approximately 37% in the NASH patients in the low dose cohort and approximately 47% in the high dose cohort.Also 35to 40% reduction in Total Bilirubin.This is encouraging.All in all if we see a reduction in Alk.Phos or the biomarker changes to CK 18 the stock is clearly a winner. Let us see what Dr.Paul Pow has to say on April 5th.",

"Mr. Yaffe, Please see the attachment. I would like to see your opinion. CK18 dropped 45% in initial DUR928 studies.",
Excellent article!  What is the potential market cap of DRRX if they are successfully in repeating their P1b data in their P2 trials?  Thanks in advance!,
"Thanks Len, I haven’t spoken with the company. what do you think of the ADHD drug with orient. I believe durect is actively seeking a partner in the US. And orient will be filing an NDA. How much value could be created there?",
"Very nice article, so the question I have is with 2 big events coming up with is the stock below 2.50$, is there a cash crunch or are these moonshots (high risk, high reward) drugs?",
With Remoxy I believe that is the first Adcom. When it comes to current value I agree still undervalued based on the fact of two possible approvals with royalty and patent payouts. If they get approved drrx will have 2 new revenue streams. Then DUR-928 data will be the game changer.,
"Hi Len, very insightful as ever and you had highlighted this company from around US$1 onwards and you make a lot of sense in saying 'it is still priced for non performance'.Wondering if you might comment on a) The KOL call for PSC (which you were on). The Dr there suggested that to be meaningful ALP needs to 'normalise', not just reduce. Big ask for DUR928?...does that mean ALP reductions are worthless, unless achieved all the way to 'normality.Remoxy...long long tortuous road. FDA now needs an advisory committee!. Does this not look like a low probability approval to you. I am sure you know the history well. I always notice DRRX management keep a polite distance from commenting on what PTIE are upto in the past...Thank you",DURECT Corporation: Upcoming Milestones And DUR-928 Progress
"Well - it's been a very long and winding road - with many twists and turns along the way ;-)My first stock buy was back in the early 90s, when I put $20,000 from my 401K into Unisys (my employer) stock when it started to recover from $2 to $4. Did VERY well by 2000, but I didn't know how to sell <sigh> ...Started reading a lot about investing just prior to 2000, started to get in - and in particular moved some of my mutual funds into more aggressive tech funds - right at the top. Unfortunate! Did a moderate amount of trading with some successes, some failures, over the next several years. Got panicked right at the bottom in March 2003. Didn't sell everything, but did sell 5 positions only to see them rapidly rebound ...Continued to do a bit of trading, but really didn't know what I was doing. Got laid off in mid-2006, and got busy with some research projects. Had saved heavily, and realized that with just a bit of luck I should be able to make it to retirement age (pension and SS) without having to work again. Didn't pay any attention to my investments, so the huge drop in 2008 was one hell of a shock! Fortunately, I had learned in 2003 to 'not sell at the bottom', so held on. Progress !!!!Realized in 2010 that I was going to have to learn how to manage my money after expensive dental bills. ALMOST got suckered into a variable annuity, but realized just in time that I could probably do just as well (or better) than that with decent bond funds! I had previously known almost nothing about bonds !!!Saw a Fidelity adviser, who put me into a reasonable mix of funds. But as I looked into what was happening with them, I started to think I could probably do better - especially than their International fund. Started looking at other choices, including my first encounter with ETFs via etfreplay.com. Ran a lot of strategies through their site (which was free at the time) and in spreadsheets, and eventually decided that switching ETFs frequently often worked out less well than simply buying and holding them.I forget when I first started looking at charts in depth, but it was probably around that time. Noticed that there had been plenty of warning signs in long-term charts prior to the 2008 crash. As I started looking at charts more, that definitely helped a lot!I think I came across Chris Ciovacco sometime in mid-2014. I learned SO much from his articles and videos. I also started to see 'managing my investments' as my 'full-time job'. I considered myself to be an 'intermediate-term trend follower'. Still am - but have refined my strategies on a regular basis.The first was in October 2014 when I started to use sector ETFs rather than just broad (including international) ETFs. Did get into a few individual stock positions, although the only one I still hold from then is FISV. It has done very well for me :-)The next year (October 2015) I decided to start including more individual stocks in the strategy. Of course, that was not great timing - but I was getting better. Lost a fair bit in the Jan fall that year, but picked up many more stocks in March and did very well through the rest of the year. Didn't get fazed by Brexit, and gained a lot of confidence throughout the year. That was the first year I did not even need to refine my strategy. Yay!2017, of course, was a great year. Things had shifted from a lot of sideways whipsaw action to a 'full bore bullish look' - as Chris Ciovacco would put it. I took full advantage of that!Also started learning about options. After some initial difficulties, including the fact that my style is not at all suited to writing covered calls (!), ended up getting 'permission' to trade regular calls in September. Had a great October, making as much in one month than I had made in each of the preceding three quarters. Then November and December got choppy and frustrating again ...Did GREAT in January - made as much before the drop as I had in the whole preceding year !!!!  But then came the downside, and I went to being around 12% down on the year. Been a bit of a frustrating yo-yo since then !!!!  Fortunately, I feel pretty confident in my chart reading - and especially at telling that the long-term upward trend is still firmly intact. Never had any reason to panic, even during the particularly nasty drops in February.But I am well aware that I am still VERY early in my learning curve - especially for options. Ended up Friday down about 6% YTD. Always aware that trends are only probabilities - but that they do work very well most of the time!I maintain a portfolio that is well diversified across (rising) sectors and markets. I keep my individual position sizes low. I cut my losers and let my winners run.Recently, I have found that options give me a lot more flexibility to use a range of position sizes (and also durations) to express different levels of conviction in positions. Still experimenting here - but I think that should work out well over the longer term.So that's the story so far ...Cheers, Ian",
"Nice story Kevin, my strategy is close to yours, and my story is long and I won't spend the time to write it for free unless I can get some handling, lol.  KISS, keep it simple simpleton, good strategy.",
"Good advice, Kevin ! ! ! Dilly Dilly ! ! !",
"Thanks Jeff.  For what it is worth...I have been investing for 50 years...still learning.  Here briefly are the steps I took.- subscribed to Fortune magazine when I was 17- Degree in Communications and Business- While in university made my first trade in 1968...a 34% gain in a few months.  Girl I knew had a summer job at a brokerage firm...her dad was Pres.- continued to play only this stock for a couple of years- once I started working in 1970 the reading began about investing.  My uncle was an institutional broker at GS...learned a lot from him. My career was in Advertising & marketing.-  In 1980 a good friend joined a major Bank.  We had been room mates.  After both his parents died he started investing with the help of his next door neighbor...went on to get a PHD in international finance and worked in Europe on international money markets. Was asst Treasurer for an international firm.- I then gave him all of my money and started serious investing.  I had a ledger in my office desk. kept track of cost + commissions....set a sell price at either 25% up or 10% down...Risk Management.- At first stocks only but as the portfolio built started to move some gains into bonds and establish a balanced portfolio.- With every $100 K increase my wife and I would go out to a very nice dinner as a ""reward"". At first there were long gaps but after a few years the frequency of these dinners increased.-  In addition to bonds I started to roll money into conservative investments. Risk Management.  I never paid attention to yields...my focus was always capital appreciation.- my style remained the same until about 20 years ago when I adopted a multi leveled portfolio.  Different levels of risk. Up till then i did a lot of trading and few stocks were held for more than 2 years.- When buying a sector I would allocate a full position as 4-5 parts and then invest in the companies that I thought would lead the sector long term.  The portfolio of all investments covered all major investment sectors with a top at about 40 stocks + some preferred + bonds.- this evolved into the strategy I have been using for the last 10 years or so. 85% of the portfolio is in cash + bonds + conservative stocks - all are long term holds. 15% is in higher risk/ high return.... like lithium, India - buy ETFs, etc.  When I buy a stock I want it to have the probability of doubling in 12 months, most do.  Gains from the 15% roll over into the 85%.In 2017 the 85% had about a 7% return, the 15% was 84%.- I get vast amounts of information from around the world every day, investment and political.-  most of our investments, outside of this account are fully managed by our Wealth Management team...started by my friend (above) who lives in the Camyans.  His son, who passed his Securities exam at 15 now runs the group.  Fee is 1% of assets under management and includes all legal, estate planning, trades, etc....complete life plan and financial plan oversight.  His son is a very astute investor and Wealth Manager...a fountain of information.LESSONS:- find someone who is much, much better than you are at investing and learn from them...use them as a sounding board before making any investments.- do not be rigid in your investment strategy...I see many on SA who focus entirely on dividends, for example.- establish rules and DO NOT BREAK THEM. Key to this is defining a ""Position"" and never exceeding that amount ( as a general rule this is 5% for me, but a couple are double...THAT is an absolute ceiling no matter how great the investment).  RISK MANAGEMENT- I keep things simple.  Buy long, add on dips, never short and do not use options. I know my personal limits and do not attempt to venture beyond them.- allocation of part of a portfolio to higher risk investments can really drive your portfolio...BUT this is NOT for beginners.  Imagine what the world will be like in 10 years.- Think GLOBAL.  Immerse yourself in diverse information daily and keep an OPEN MIND.- I am a behavior based investor. All the numbers you see are old information.  i put far more emphasis on the probability of where a company will be in 3-5 years, who is running it, what is the vision, and how well they are moving forward.  The behavior of PEOPLE make the numbers happen.",

"I am very new to this individual investor game and still early in my learning curve.

Suffice to say I've made some pretty bad moves, but fortunately, am about even (+1.8%) As of end of day, Friday.What I've learned about myself is that I'm a lot more risk averse than I thought I'd be. I've been buying on dips, but holding my dividend yielding equities and not selling them on the rips. Also made some stupid errors by neglecting to set limits and stops on a few purchases that gained briefly and one in particular that absolutely flat-lined.I've been reading S.A. for the last month and have learned more than I can imagine.",

"THE MARKETS TODAY COULD TURN ON A DIME.  Risk is much higher than stated.

Strangely expect 1950s tensions to re-appear and escalate rapidly if Bolton resurrects the Taiwan sovereignty stance abandoned now for 20+ years.  Cancelling the Iran deal will dramatically heighten tensions in the Middle East (Israel, Syria, Lebanon & Iraq).

If the Russian orchestrated contrivances are too transparent, they'll be obvious for what they are, and seriously compromise US standing/trust worldwide.  The drumbeat for shifts in US policy and the makeup of the Congress will span Wall  Street to Main Street if the US lifts Russian sanctions, if a global trade war ensues, or worse if Korean success & a Russian deal emboldens himself to fire the Special Prosecutor, creating immense uncertainty approaching the election in November.

Anyone done the calculations on how much GTE will generate in FCF / EBITDA with Brent at 80?NAV per share must be close to CAD 6 with these prices.,
Some softness lately although Brent is hitting new hight daily.,
in this stock for three years and agree the acquisition is the key to its growth if they were holding your own at $30 oil we should see some greater gains at the current price of $60 they do have some geographical issues getting to the oil cheaply but hopefully they have figured it out and have hit a good Basin of production hold until relieved,
What a fantastic report. Company is printing money with low decline rates selling the right API grade oil. Adding to P1 and P2 reserves from exploration program. All within cash flow and then some. Should be up 10%. I wonder who sold at 3.93 at open…,
I feel your pain rusty.,
I got destroyed on a couple of equities in different sectors suffered massive losses.. I was foolish for not selling when I had the chance so I now I'm quick to take profits as I'm shell shocked.. Unfortunately all my successful Oil profits have been wiped out.. Expensive lesson learned.. Sometimes a company can hold $500 mil in assets with manageable debt and still trade for $50 mil.. Some mgmt teams can NOT be trusted..,
Had to take some profits off the table before the market takes it back.. Still long most shares..,
This is fantastic!! Will be north of CAD 5 before Q1...still trades at PE of 10 assuming Brent 60. Now Brent is at 73.5...,
it finally closed above $3!,
It refuses to break $3.. It's unfortunate but I guess Syria may create a move higher at least for the short term..,
"And we just got a 52-week high, I think this can go straight to CAD 5, seriously undervalued.",
"Although I have complained about this stock all year, I am still holding.",
I have a sell order on some of my shares at $3.04 but it seems like a difficult task.. Maybe once it hits the $3 mark it will gain more momentum.. I may change my sell order either way.. GTE is one stubborn stock..,

This has been on my wish list for a while. Thanks for the article. Hopefully I can cash out of another position with a profit before this takes off.,
It looks undervalued but then over the last few years it has gone from a big net cash position to a sizable net debt one and its stock price was cut in more than half.,
"GTE has been undervalued for some time. Recent price action gives some support to the notion that the stock price is bottoming, but there have been quite a few false dawns.

"Hi Pezwell420,I sure don't want to argue with you on this so please take my question/comments as a request for help to overcome my present thinking in order to buy back into this stock.I bought early on into the big 3 MJ stocks to enjoy the rising tide, waiting for more info as the market developed, to sort the wheat from the chaff.  I recently sold out of Aurora due to what I thought were hasty capital allocation decisions and ones that I thought would put the company's financial status in jeopardy in the long run.  Aphria was to be a long term hold for me, along with Canopy, Cronos Group and a few others, so I had to be shaken out of the tree when I sold last week.SITUATION:First, Nuuvera may well have been the best candidate for purchasing based upon this and that.  Only the insiders could weigh in on that statement.  But why I left the stock was due to biases.  MY PROBLEM:I find biases involving money very hard to dismiss, especially when you have a choice that is either going to confirm your original bias (investment decision) was right (and puts money in your pocket), or leave that investment where it started, for the whims of the market to decide.Are you saying that 4 gentlemen that can see a 3-4 times return on ""$2000"" have no bias when it comes to what their company pays for a certain (their investment) company, either the amount they pay or the the company versus the other opportunities out there?  That this take over candidate doesn't personally look any better than others when it comes time to spend company money?  Personally, any time I have a chance to put $40K into my pocket (about the same ratio to me as those guys put into their pockets), I'm going to be pretty biased and I too am an honest person.  So I don't question their honesty, but I do question the methodology that is used in a company that I invest in, viz., put personal money into a company and then buy it later with a public company's money.  This appears to me to be an dangerous methodology for a capital allocator to use for making good decisions with someone else's money.Please convince me so I can get back in.m",
"Hit Piece for a Hit Piecesubmitted 1 day ago * by zan5kiI am creating this post in response to the recent Globe and Mail and Seeking Alpha articles regarding Aphria's Nuuvera deal. I will start with the Globe and Mail article and then move to the Seeking Alpha article. I am writing not because I am invested in Aphria (which I am, heavily), but because I have seen some flat out ridiculous opinions flying around and I don't think they should go unanswered, especially when I question the intent of those spreading the misinformation. Investors should understand the plain facts, not be manipulated by them for the benefit of others.It's patently ridiculous that anyone would care about this situation when it is no different than those which occur routinely in the marketplace. Somehow though, this one's different. It's quite frankly bizarre.The amount in the deal we're talking about here is $3.85M profit on a Nuuvera private placement of $900,000 split between 7 Aphria insiders made last August. That's $550,000 each. To put that in context, seed shares represent 15% of Aphria's float. Assuming Vic owns 5% of those shares (15% split evenly between himself and the other two founders), was never compensated in stock, never bought more, and never made any other money in his entire life (his current salary is over $2M a year, he was the CEO of Jameison for 20 years, etc.) his net worth from Aphria seed capital alone is $143,000,000 (using fully diluted market cap of $2.86B for Aphria). $550,000 is 0.385% of that. If you were worth $500,000, this transaction would represent less than $2,000 to you. Incredible.The shares are locked up on top of that. These people couldn't cash out even if they wanted to, which they don't!The author's reporting is also beyond unprofessional. Expecting replies on a Sunday? ""Coincidental"" encounters at the Shangri-la? And then worst of all there is the article itself, which contains a train of thought so nonsensical it almost looks like the author went out of her way to avoid understanding her own topic:The personal investments of Aphria insiders in Nuuvera weren't previously disclosed in regulatory filings or on Canada's System for Electronic Disclosure by Insiders (SEDI), which tracks the trading activity of company insiders. Whether Aphria should have informed its investors depends on how material the information is – and companies have a lot of latitude in determining materiality.""There is no requirement to disclose this information,"" Andrew Schwartz, a spokesperson for Aphria, said on Friday. ""The investments are immaterial to Nuuvera and to the individuals who made the investments.""She does not dispute the fact that this information is immaterial. She makes a case herself that there is latitude there in the first place on top of that fact. Nonetheless she then goes on to suggest the possibility of wrongdoing:Even though the four Aphria executives have much larger stakes in Aphria than they did Nuuvera, their undisclosed personal stakes in Nuuvera raise questions around the potential for conflicts of interest.Conflicts arise when a director or officer has a material interest in another company entering into a material transaction with their company, per the Ontario Business Corporation Act. It says that these conflicted company insiders should neither attend any part of a board meeting when the transaction is being discussed nor should they vote on the deal.How can a conflict of interest exist when one of the conditions is violated right off the bat?!?! This is unprofessional, unintelligent, and inappropriate. It kills the author's credibility as a reporter and may also say something about her integrity.What am I saying though, it's a reporter after all. One who works for the most anti-pot newspaper in the country. Clicks are what matter to these people so I'm probably being quite naive to think they care about professionalism.More inaccuracies/obfuscation in the article (credit to GoBlue):“In February, as marijuana stocks fell after a rally and Aphria took a closer look at Nuuvera's assets, Aphria slashed the cash portion of the deal to 60 cents a share from $1.”As many of you know.... in the original deal there was a requirement for Nuu to hold a minimum amount of cash at closing. By purchasing Avanti NUU would have been below that threshold. The cash portion was adjusted for that reason. It wasn’t “slashed” after taking a “closer look”.“Last August, they acquired a total of 900,000 shares in Nuuvera for $1 each, The Globe and Mail has learned. Nuuvera, which was still private at the time and raising money to fuel its growth, sold 4 million shares in that round of financing. Aphria itself also participated in the offering, buying 2 million shares, according to regulatory filings. (Last November, Aphria said it upped its stake in Nuuvera by another 2 million shares for $2.50 apiece.) At Friday's closing price, the deal turned that $900,000 investment into about $4.75-million for the Aphria insiders in the space of about seven months.”What is left out is that Aphria and it’s shareholders also made money as a result in the increase in value of Aph 4 million in shares in NUU. Where is that calculation?And now for the Seeking Alpha article. This will be shorter because most of the points are covered above. I do want to say something about it though because it too is ridiculous in its own special little way.Nate Anderson, the author of the article, says his outfit sees no value in the Nuuvera deal. That's is flat out hilarious considering he put NO effort whatsoever into projecting the value of the deal. When someone analyzes a deal they routinely deconstruct it into its individual parts and attempt to assign each possible avenue a value, both in terms of current and future potential to generate revenue/asset value. All Nate Anderson did was focus on the current revenues and values without making a single projection regarding what the endeavours should be worth in the future. No talk of synergies either, which is another basic area of analysis done on these types of deals. Kind of difficult to see the value in a deal you never even bothered to project, isn't it?!Here's the part that really ticks me off. If this were just a random weedstock enthusiast or beginner analyst I would chop this up to inexperience, but Nate Anderson, is the freaking CEO of a finance company. It's pretty unthinkable to me that he omitted this basic, textbook area of analysis by mistake. He's either an incredibly inept financial analyst, in which case no one should be putting any stock whatsoever into his ""analysis"", or he's being purposfully obtuse in an attempt to mislead people. Considering his self-disclosed short position the answer is obvious to me.So there they are people, the facts. Careful who you listen to when it comes to investing.Edit: my first sticky! Thanks!",

"Reading this as Hindenburg Investment Research giving altruistic advice on a big red flag they fear will lose investors money isn't possible for me given the ""red flags"" they are trying to raise here without addressing the actual ramifications. So ""insiders"" are legally profiting from holding shares in the businesses they work with. That is not really a story but given Hindenburg Investment Research's history of fear mongering for stocks they themselves are shorting like Nuuvera, it  is apparent to me they are (as they disclosed) seeking a lower short value of Nuuvera and are in a panic after Aphria announced a deal with Nuuvera, causing a price rise they are trying to lower to recuperate their own losses.  Anyone familiar with Aphria knows it has a strong hold on the Canadian pot market, the most efficient production facilities and the 2nd largest, and their profits are on track to multiply big time every year. If Hindenburg Investment Research publishes 3 stories in a row scare mongering about Nuuvera, iti s because they failed to anticipate that Nuuvera is merely specialized in getting access to pot sales in foreign country and their profits are not important, as they planned to partner with a producer in the first place. This article is 100% bunk and when Aphria hits the 20$ price goal near the end of the year, the writers will be publishing another hit piece on an entirely different company they tried to short without full research just like when they hit the panic button that Eros International stablized after a short or when Majesco Entertainment stabilized after they hit the panic button. ""Hindenburg Investment Research"",literally the implication in their name is they are skeevy shorters who don't research beyond dips and stock patterns proven not important without external context.",

Yes, we have been told that he is only selling to fund philanthropy, but it sure does make those willing to invest wonder.  https://cnb.cx/2ulXxZc",
Now following Jae Jun...,
Facebook will come out of this smelling like a rose when all the dust clears,
"Jae Jun,  I agree with the premises of your article on valuation.  However, suppose data privacy laws are changed requiring consumers to ""opt in"" for their data to be collected and used?  How might this impact FB and Google?  To me that is the biggest risk for internet advertisement companies because it would impact how much advertisers would be willing to spend on these platforms.  WD",
This is the beginning of it's transition to dividend stock...,
Zuckerberg is acting like a Harvard Drop Out !!,
The biggest risk to FB shareholders by far is Zuckerberg continuing to act stupid.  He waited too long to comment on this issue and let the media and politicians create their own narratives.  Then he immediately throws himself on the regulation sword over what is essentially a very small issue.  I mean this issue would be virtually nothing if Cambridge Analytica wasn't tied to the Trump campaign.  Just fix it and promise the politicians you will fix it.  If you are looking to add shares I might wait until after his Congressional testimony (or at least during).  He's likely to be a mess and cause even more drama.,
"Taking  a simple and objective look at the situation; if $EXP survived and began recovering from it's more serious data breech issue, $FB should be able to do the same.",
"This is an excellent article.  I'd just like to add that when Facebook users have to be reminded not to post their vacation plans, down to the details of when and how long they will be gone from their address specific homes, it's kind of difficult to protest their personal info being ""hijacked.""",
Thank you for the excellent article and research.  I bought today.,
"This latest wave of negativity, in addition to what Nomura is calling a 'data bubble', is working double time against FB and other FANG stocks.  Unsustainable returns and hype from FANGs isn't likely to end pretty.  Stocks valued at atmospheric valuations that are priced to absolute perfection, usually don't fall gradually when things get ugly.",
"congrats, the title has proved itself to be right.",
Deliberately misleading title huh? Pleasantly surprised. What data breach? It's not like Equifax or HD or Target. The business model is still intact. All this hoopla is just politics. I think FB is regulation savvy and will stay ahead of the regulators. Game on.,
I will not delete my Facebook account because others are doing it.,
"ShamWow over @ Tesla just shut down his Tesla, Space X FB pages.  I think many more will do so as well.",
"Fair enough. Thanks for responding.Obviously, I felt strongly enough to buy them, but it would be nice to get some confirmation.Anybody else? The author? OR anyone?",
"Facebook members have awoken to the ripe old saying that ""Nothing in Life is Free.""  In the context of Facebook, if you don't know what their product is that provides their profits to operate their ""Free Services"", then you're the product.  That wasn't a concern when No. 44 used Facebook data: http://bit.ly/2GOKt15But when others are discovered to have used Facebook, it is just so awful.",
"Eventually Facebook won't be able to keep loading more ads into News Feed and Instagram. The ads will have to become more expensive in one way or another. in a similar vein, where can Facebook add users where the users have any money to spend? The ARPU outside of the USA and a few other rich countries is much lower. I wonder where the growth will come from. Who can you acquire when you're in a duopoly?",
"Thanks. Yes, I'm a long-term investor.What do you think about the 2 others (Alibaba and Tencent)?I hope I'm right on all 3 !!!",
"I now have over 10 percent in FB and over 10 percent in BABAand about 5 percent in TCEHY.I got them all on sale recently,and sure hope that the author is right,and they will all recover and fly high and long!They all seem like very solid companies and it's too hard to resist a good sale.",
I have watched a lot of CNBC over last couple months during a cross-country move. You need to pick through and there are a couple very smart analysts on there that makes sense to listen to & take ideas from.  The rest are bandwagon jumpers who change their tones overnight & seem more reactive than proactive,
Facebook is a joke and serves no real productive value to a person's life. It just a big nosey gossip column for friends and family who are addicted to it who have nothing better to do with their lives. It's just a waste of time being on Facebook. I hope the stock tanks to $13 or less.,
"""My verdict? No.""CNBC has too much time on their hands so they slash away at FB.A comment on another FB article was something to the effect that the young ones do not use FB.More than likely as they age, they will so as not to lose contact with their friends/family !",
Twitter should benefit from this screw up by FB and believe  me CNBC / NBC  will not let up until they recoup there losses on the 500 million they invested in Snap.,
"Lots of emotional investors. I sold my longs near the highs prior to the recent scandal involving data breaches. Now contemplating a new position, just need to decide whether to go long or short. My instincts tell me FB is a good short (with volatility) to its 52 week low of about $135.  The stock could appreciate to its highs if Zuch is fired.",
It’s worth less.,
Long term Facebook becomes like Yahoo.,
if Wells Fargo and Equifax can do all kinds of horrible really bad stuff with peoples finances and SSI numbers and the stock prices still recover.. this will too !!! :),
"People buy momentum stocks when they drops 10-20% from their all time high. They think it is cheap. I doubt. The market would certainly penalize this for a while, could be a big while.",
LOL all the negativity etc.. i expect us to be much higher in a few months... !,
Delete your Facebook.,
"They are now confirming all accounts with a photo ID. Wait until Wall Street and it's advertisers realize ~70% of accounts are non-human (pets, duplicate accounts, etc).",
It's very annoying that FB doesn't break out their revenue or operating profit across their businesses.,
"In my life, for the things I need and use FB for, there is no substitute. Anyone who wants to share use FB. Anyone who wants to keep secrets, whisper.",
"Nice article Jae, I'm with you that this looks like an overreaction. Stocks with transitory scandals in the headlines usually do pretty well after the initial plunge. Check out the charts of Equifax, Wells Fargo, Mylan, and Volkswagen: http://bit.ly/2GiyY47. I don't think FB's scandal is any worse than those guys, they'll survive.",
Your talking about today's numbers. We'll have to wait and see after Q2.I'm seeing lots of triple tops.,
"I agree on the fundamentals. But, you said, ""Like most things, the media is blowing this out of proportion for the sake of clicks and views. The sole purpose of a media outlet is to attract eyeballs, and as they do so often, they jump from one ""news"" band wagon to another. Facebook just happens to be the punching bag of the day,"" and I think this is an egregious correlation of the news. We're talking about over 50 million individuals that had their private information misused, against the terms of usage, specifically for the swaying of political views during an election. I don't think it's being blown out of proportion nor is it being reported simply for click and views making Facebook a punching bag of the day.",
Fb going to 100 as more breaches are announced. Buy or keep at your peril.,
"With >2Billion users and very high engagement already, how much room for growth is there? FB's market cap after the fall is greater than Disney, Comcast & Netflix combined. This is the kind of comparison that used to be made about AOL.Graham & other value investors consider growth the least reliable component of valuation.Beyond the issue of data security, concerns are being expressed about FB being addictive and damaging to mental health of users. http://cnb.cx/2uh1Xkehttp://cbsn.ws/2GaGhuPWhat if ZUCK who has pledged to donate the majority of his wealth to charity, decides to dial back on some of the addictive properties of his offerings? What if regulators decide to do it for him?I have no position and wouldn't short this, but these are issues to consider before going long.",
"The trouble is there is going to be very bad news for awhile. Just wait until the Mueller investigation wraps up and they indite top FB officials that knew all about what Cambridge Analytica was up to, and probably others too. Don't assume this is the end of it...",
"I think Facebook does face 3 serious, secular risk.  It may come under regulatory scrutiny and may be judged a monopoly.  Amazon could become a serious advertising competitor and siphon business away from FB.  Finally, there are a bunch of hopping mad millennials looking for someone to blame for Hellaries loss.  They will leave FB and never look back.Does that mean FB is expensive or a sale?  I think not.  Inertia will temper any changes in the user base and advertising dollar.  FB will continue to grow and enjoy a PEG ratio < 1.  That makes FB a buy at anything below 180.  A target price of 240 this time next year is not unreasonable.  If FB declares a small dividend, they are almost assured to stem the blood loss and reverse the downtrend.  I’m selling Puts and placing vertical bull spread calls.  Easy money IMHO.",
"Facebook will be fine, stock will go back up well over 200 per share and if you hold will someday will surpass GOOGLE in value.  Facebook is and always will be the best social media platform and like Apple INC, will continue to evolve and lead the way with cutting edge products and services.  They will stay relevant.  Of course there will be bumps and hiccups on the way.  This is a company that wants to touch every part of the world.  I believe that someday China will be joining the ranks of Facebook users/consumers in the future and that the United States will be one of Facebook's smallest consumers in proportion of their huge number of productive users across the globe.",
the trend is your friend wait for the trend about the 200-day moving average sell if the cross is below the 200-day,
"1) The data side of the business will be fundamentally changed either by a shift in consumer preferences or regulation.2) I've never convinced that social media online advertising is actually effective for selling consumer products. It's more of a psy-ops thing. If you want the data-driven ad business, buy some GOOG/GOOGL.3) Anecdotally speaking, a lot of young people have already left  Facebook for other platforms.4) Older people who now contribute much of the content/comment on Facebook tend to be more sensitive to privacy concerns5) FB might be more interesting as an investment when it drops below $100.6) This company needs to be split up.",
Long FB!!!,
Yes worth a lot more then $169.,
"I have never been a Facebook shareholder.The 5 year expected PEG ratio is now below 1.00, so I do not view Facebook as overpriced.If all of this Cambridge Analytica nonsense causes Facebook to fall to its 52 week low of 137, I will invest in it.",
"re Facebook evaluation.  all the numbers used are very interesting  - but meaningless.  imagine a competitor that protects information, and not only protects it, allows the individual to share in the use of the information - in short - the user gets paid to participate.  an algorithm evaluates each aspect of the individuals information and sells it to interested buyers.  the combination of information will make niche marketing much more efficective, and it will not have to be subversive as is the case with Facebook.   It will all be identified in the intake form, and those that enjoy making money based upon who they are and what they know - will be happy to involve themselves - it is just a matter of time.the only thing of value in  Facebook is the existing market is extensive - but that will change when an alternative is available.  all done using block chain technology. - Facebook may try and catch up, but they will have to resign all customers to compete.  it could be done but will fail to pass the smell test.",
Title is wrong. Must be changed.,
Agree with your long term thesis FB will be fine in there long run but in the short term I'm thinking we'll see it between $145 and $150,
"FB admits almost 300M of its accounts are fake or duplicates - I think the number's much higher if you factor in the 50M-100M pet accounts, duplicate biz-personal accounts, bots, etc and wonder why people waste time on it anyhow.  Humans have less than a 9  sec attention span and there's a lot of pure unadulterated mush-trash circulating on FB competing for those eyeballs, dwell time, attention span.I'm long GOOG -- better software and software developers than the FB carnival, pure amusement show.",
As money is a finite item in the world I live in; I sold my Facebook and am putting it all on IQ next week,
FB is worth what the market seems it to be worth,
I wouldn't buy FB stock at $36/share. May at $9,
"So bait and switch on the title? Clever, used car salesmen use the same tactic. Particularly useful when the fear in the air is thick enough to cut it with a knife! What will stop FB slide? That's the question that investors want answered. Zuck in his t shirt in front of a congressional committee? Nope EU Taxing social media? Nope User decline? Don't think so. 10% decline 20%? Oversold territory?",
"Its about regulation.  Its coming and the unfettered use of client data will be compromised.  Earning will NOT be the same in the future. This is the flattening of the J curve.  Look elsewhere than FB, GOOG and AMZN.",
"I just don't understand all the hysteria. FB does not have any what I consider to be dangerous or critical data on me and my family. I could care less that they know what smart phone we use, software platform, gender, age, friends and associates, blah, blah, blah. Google and Amazon accumulate far more data. AND most importantly, Unlike financial entities, merchants & medical online accounts with VERY dangerous data like SSN, credit card and/or bank account data, etc., etc... and yet many have been hacked. Equifax??? Now THAT was/ is dangerous. I'm on my 4th VISA card in 6 months because of hacked vendors. Now THAT is a hassle.",
"You see how much negative sentiment hurt Experian.  Also as many have pointed out, worldwide usage is far greater than U.S. usage.  And the rest of the world is not going to freak out like we are about user data taken illicitly for Republican advantage in American elections.",
"The hysteria being put out there is from the legacy media companies from which Facebook has/is taking ad revenue and user influence. All these companies have been doing the same thing as Facebook with personal information for years, but now they see an opportunity to try and discredit Facebook, in an effort to recapture lost revenue and influence.  If the government should pass regulations to cover this issue, the legacy apps and websites would probably be severely hurt, which is probably why Zuck has said “yes” we welcome regulation.  I believe in the long run regulation would hurt legacy media far more than Facebook.  That would be ironic, what goes around comes around.  Despite the negative comments on Zuck, he may be two steps ahead, by setting a trap legacy media hadn’t considered.  Time will tell.",
"Well done. Following now. You’re echoing my sentiments. I recently initiated a size-able position (5% of portfolio) at $167. My hope is the stock continues to slide so I can add more. I’m comfortable taking FB up to 20% of my portfolio. It is not often you get the opportunity to buy a company like FB with a massive moat, extremely profitable and addicting at a discount (PEG < 1). Right now BABA (20% of portfolio) is cheaper than FB. KMI (20% of portfolio) is crazy cheap on improving fundamentals.",
FB is way undervalued.  Stay long  S/B 210 by year end .,
I like this well written article. A good company with solid earnings. The snowflake CEO and the COO need to take crisis management 101 though. Lousy handling of this otherwise unimportant issue.,
Fb is undervalued. This news will blow over buy at lows.,
I expect few people to delete but for sure more people to be aware of their privacy settings going forward.,
Great article. I agree and bought shares at $165.54 todaybought bought shares,
"I’m long on the stock, but think many people, this article included, are underestimating the number of people that will be leaving Facebook behind. People were already doing it, before the Cambridge Analytica as shown in the company’s earnings call slides with US declining daily active users. There is FB fatigue and crisis of trust, the recent news is confirmation of what many suspected, not the catalyst. Also while probably a long way off, regulatory action has the potential to limit the effectiveness of their advertising targeting.",
Fb is worth zero . Good luck bag holders,
Time for a dividend facebook. Long Facebook.,
"Is AMZN worth $1,562 pshareshare",
"I absolutely agree with this! Facebook is a steal right now. People aren't even understanding how few people were affected by the breach of data. It was non-personal, non-critical data, that users agreed to disclose to their trendy quiz app using the Facebook platform. It was Cambridge Analytica that misused the data. Facebook has already patched the issue with where the data leaked from. I feel bad for people who may have sold and freaked out thinking this was a much bigger issue than it really is.",
i am more concerned that the average user spends less time on facebook.  this has already happened to me. i have other ways to communicate with circles of friends.  facebook is now a once a week deal.  i still like it but ....  this could dramatically change their revenue over time.,
Using a DCF FB is worth about $80 based on a 5 year EPS growth rate of 17% and growing with the economy thereafter.  Discount rate is 10%.  (P.S. 8.5% is ridiculous especially with risk free two year rate now tickling 2.5%).,
"Perfect article Jae Jun! I bought a lot of FB during its lowest points after its IPO. Ever since then, FB stocks have financed other purchases I've made as I peel away shares. I monitor my position closely but I'm still far into the green.I believe the real test will start in July/August 2018 as the mid-term election season heats-up. Everyone's eyes will be on FB as news starts roiling across the platform. Bots will race through different feeds and FB technologists will be sorting and removing stories and reports, and then there will be the usual - Right to Free Speech frenzy....There's a lot of news ahead.Still, I have a lot of shares left and I expect FB to ultimately achieve a $250+ stock price - probably after the elections. Just a gut perception, or maybe a hope because there are other stocks I want to buy.",
"Good use of valuation methods, however does this also mean that Netflix, Amazon, and Nvidia are not worth investment?",
The title is kinda misleading compared to the content.It sounds like FB is not worth 169.The content says it should be more than 169,
"Exactly. Drama reigns the world today. Especially, US",
Agree.,
Great article. Nothing to add. Long FB,
"...,.Nazis SS would love Cambridge Analytica and FB. Great way to herd the unsuspecting populace. Perfect lesson Steve Bannon.",
I like the title.  Very accurate.  Worth much higher.  Increased my already healthy position by almost 20% this week.,
Fb is still worth 240,
FB is in business to mine your data and sell it that’s their business model and Zuckerberg says shut up and we know best! They can always be hacked into and your data stolen and once it gets into web it is gone. Just overlay everything I have said on investment metrics. Would some international entity non profit be better with no ads pop ups whatever.,
"Jae, very nice article. Thank you.Long FB.",
"I’ve also come up with $250. If Equifax could survive its very real gross negligence and fraud, FB can survive this completely exaggerated fiasco.",
Good article. FB will be fine long term. I still believe the stock needs another leg lower to enter. Next few weeks will be interesting. Either way will be entering a call option soon.,
thanks great read. numbers look good,
Nice article but the title needs to be changed..the title does NOT do justice to the nice article..,
"I agree with the premise of this article. Although I would guess that a larger majority of people who delete their account will be active and not inactive users. The people I know that don't use Facebook, don't have the app on their phone I can't imagine people downloading the app just to delete their account.",
Nice article. I agree 100%,
How much do you think think it will cost FB to address data security as also to monitor its content. They are hiring thousands of new employees to do so. How much will it cost the bottom line if they are banned from Europe?,
Oh hi Mark,
Did you write this story for the story title placement? If not you need to change it! Lol,

"""No company in the United States over the last three months has had more insider selling than Facebook."" -Jesse FelderI am not long FB, nor am I short, but that is an interesting fact to ponder.",
"Hard to believe that Washington will pass any meaningful regulation that will result in any kind of earnings loss for FB. FB gives advertisers and apps the opportunity to use the data it has but google actively uses it as an essential centerpiece of its strategy. You might even argue that data is Google's moat. So any potential regulation could seriously hurt it. But TWTR who essentially collects no data got hammered on the FB news and Google almost not at all. If Wall Street can't really completely understand the data collection landscape how will Congress? Sure Kushner can pull in one of his Harvard tech buddies to explain everything, but convince a majority of Congressmen of the reality of things? Not hardly. I would hope that any potential regulation would do something like prohibit apps to have terms of use like requiring sharing of data that is not directly related to the personal profile of the person using the app. That would prevent apps like WhatsApp and FB Messenger from sucking in all the info in your phone contacts to help recommend friends and do other stuff behind the scenes. That's what they do now and you can't get around it (surprised?). But I don't even expect that to happen. What effect would this have on FB earnings? I think directly none, but it would limit the growth of network connections which would indirectly result in less organic/viral potential, but FB is already moving in that direction to push people towards paying for ads.",
"FB still has a lot of room to grow, China is an example, with Trump's high tech trade war, maybe China will open up to FB ? That's another billion user min. Long FB.",
Long FB. It seems like the loudest and harshest critics of FB don't even own or ever owned the stock. Where do these people come from any way and what is wrong with them?,
Positive: FB has no exposure to China :) Another positive? Any regulation would be across the board and increase the moat for FB. Yet more positives? This was not a hack and no financially sensitive data were lost. Even more positives? FB is a well managed company with iron clad fundamentals and growth perspectives. Conclusion? Buy buy buy buy when the weak hands sell :) :) :P,
Facebook has put newspapers on the decline nothing to  many investors,
"CNBC is beginning to look like a joke....can they bring on anymore negative speakers.  How does one compare the Johnson & Johnson Tylenol debacle to this?  Uh, people died remember?  OK so we should have some regulations addressed, but let's not get carried away, this is after all a platform for free speech and lastly, Facebook doesn't charge it's users so where are they supposed to make money?  I think it's a fair trade-off.",
The whole episode is about politics.,
"Bill, what's your take on Zuckerberg's call for government regulation of his business?  This seems to me a gigantic threat to FB's future earnings growth (and an illegal breach of his fiduciary duty).  We all know the difference in earnings growth rate for a utility vs. a disruptive tech company.  This is my primary concern, and the only way I can see the stock price falling down to B&H's ""buy"" level.",
"If  understand it right, FB was started in a dorm room as a joke, a replica of a  college yearbook.  Remember, we used to pass our yearbooks around, have everybody sign them.  Fast forward, now that concept hits capitalism, and the desire to produce a product that is both interesting, and makes money, comes full circle.  FB is breaking new ground.  How would a college freshman ever see his company going around the world, in hundreds of languages.  Never been done before, not duplicated today.  I once heard a quote about America in the 1960s that seems, to me, to open a door to the problem.  ""In the 1960s, the whole country was having a nervous breakdown.  We were making history faster than we were able to learn from it.""  FB has been churning up the space where they live so much faster than they can digest even the dust they have created.  I sold my FB, all of it, but only because it doesn't pay a  dividend, and because I think I can get back in for less.  I was thinking I wanted to take profits before this problem surfaced.  FB has a place in our culture, and our country.  It will repair the problems, and we will all learn from the history that we made. If you liked it before, let the dust settle, and buy more at fire sale prices.  If you invest for a dividend, but got sidetracked into FB as I did, because it was so new, so exciting,  sell, and find a nice dividend producer, as I have done.  FB will be fine, and will continue.",

FB will not change their ways until they are regulated and forced to protect user privacy. Advertisers are leaving as well. FB is nothing more that a fad that is fastlosing popularity. As an investor, the most prudent thing would be to identify the next great growth opportunity and forget about FB until such time as the company takes appropriate action.Talking about the most recent flap on CNN is not the solution.",
news should have focussed on what hurts the common person which was the Equifax hack of 100+ million users but everyone likes to talk about what everyone likes to use or hear,
It's actually been hilarious to me seeing any large media conglomerate (and FB competitor for ad revenue) round up as many negative headlines on FB as they can possibly imagine up.  I will offer a slow clap to the media for successfully damaging the FB brand quite materially in the short-run.  But I have a feeling that in the long-run (years from this date) it will have simply served to give a lot bulls a great discount on a monster media company that's not going away any time soon.,

Remember, our country is mainly a company which was founded by wealthy English traitors...",
I have to say that I really enjoy the commentary on this article......it helps me understand how real investors think....Thank You!,
"I think the trade tariff has a lot to do with BABA. it will be $10 the way Trump is imposing trade wars on China. Will anyone comment how is trade war affecting the Chinese stocks, they are down more than 10% today?",
China has more to lose than the US and Trump knows it. All you loser liberals just can't take it that trump beat the crook. China is bankrupt and can't afford a trade war.,
too many rate hikes and now tariffs.. a lot of trump's investments have gone into bankruptcy and then his lawyers bail him out as the investors suffer.. same thing is happening to america and the world as he sets him and his family up for success.. who will get fired this week as everyone in white house walks on egg shells.. expect a wild trading range for baba this year and all the other faang and bat stocks.. I would buy in the high 160's to low 170's and keep selling in the 190's and low 200's.. analysts can estimate high and force another miss and sell off stock as well.. wall street politics as well.. bought in the 80's and sold in the 180's this year.. on the sidelines for all of the high flyers nvda amzn goog tcehy baba nflx fb etc!,
Today’s sell off is a nonsense!!! I can’t understand,
"I sold a few days ago on the news Trump might do something like this, although companies like BABA and are exposed very little, if any, to US trade. China cannot afford not to retaliate. Otherwise it will look weak, which is not in its interests.I actually sold all my Chinese holdings, very reluctantly but at nice profits.I fully intend to buy back BABA and the others when the dust settles, or when some sanity seems to emerge.",
"Screaming buy like when I bought in ‘16. Sometimes the valuations just don’t make sense (FB and KMI for instance). As Buffett said “short term the market is a voting machine, long term it is a weighing machine.” Eventually the price will reflect the earnings. BABA is 20% of my portfolio. Unit cost $72.",
"BABA will not need USA to grow, will have most all other parts of the world.",
50Billiion? and how many people live in China? I don't think 50 billion dollars will really damper the Chinese economy.,
"Well....re: the valuation.....it could it be that the smart money does not believe the revenue numbers....or any of BABA's numbers for that matter... to be accurate.  The price support is coming from CCP/Offshore/Caymans money.  When that fades, BABA will be worthless.  All the best.....",
Sold my BABA 188.25 as I think the 60 billion has created a shorting opportunity that is taking place with the stock. Believe in the company yet may be able to get a lower price as this impetuous game via the president plays out.,
"Comparing the value of a company to one that may be greatly overvalued likely brings one the wrong answer. This was done during the .com phase and created many bubbles. In other words, garbage in garbage out. On the other hand, I think the company is probably fairly valued considering the risks of accounting irregularities as there have been clouds surrounding this company for years. Finally, there is the trade war with China. What if it gets out of hand and China outlaws VIE’s (variable interest entities)? Possible existential risk to ones entire investment. Unlikely- and out there just the same. Sleep well...",

Do you think a 10% tarif on Chinese goods will start a trade war?,
"Looks like Trump, self-proclaimed genius that he is, has signed $50Billion in tariffs against China.  I've been waiting for something to drive down shares of Chinese stocks.  I'll look for a bottom and then buy names like BABA and Tencent.The Trump factor and just the basic China discount is why BABA has not flown even higher in 2017-18.",
I would agree with you. Purchased some today at 185.50. This is the AMZN of China. They will be purchasing other companies and continuing to grow. They will diversify. Stock price could go lower in the short term. Looking for much higher prices in the future.,

"Basically, the Trump debacle on trade has turned into a circus...and I just insulted people who scoop crap in circuses.  This guy shoots everywhere and asks questions later.  Nothing he has done has helped ""trade workers"" because all of the steel maker stocks got several bullets when he was ""spraying everywhere"".  Kind of like the relationships with woman over the years.  Forget Micron, the majority of this stock market is going to continue to tank indefinitely because Trump will never admit he's wrong on how he handled something; especially so important.  The only issue he should have ever been concerned with is working slowly on China's theft of intellectual property and their demands for anybody doing business there to give up their technology and plans.  That is the one and only issue worth dealing with seriously over time regarding trade.  However, people who do business in China need to also know what they are dealing with.  It's not like we don't have 3 billion other people on the planet that can manufacture cheap(er) labor.  Go to South or Central America...or anywhere else...why do we need China now or long term?  South America could boom and provide the cheap labor and be China in just a few years.  They could be the industrial Dubai quickly - China would tank faster than you can say ""Trade War"".  Screw them.For those who think I'm just a Hillary loving liberal...I voted for Trump.  The broad stock market will tank.  Trump is too stubborn to ever admit he's wrong; which is why he goes through a cabinet member, adviser, or FBI agent seemingly every day.  The guy did a great job selling a game changing tax plan that could have sparked this economy like Reagan.  He's now nullified pretty much any gains we would, and will,  have certainly had with the tax change. P.S. - And who's brilliant idea was it to fire your secretary of state and chief financial adviser (and everybody else that keeps leaving) the same week Powell comes out and raises rates .25 - this market has gotten bludgeoned and this is just the start of the bloodbath.  The 10 year is down, inflation non-existent, workforce on about a perfect pace forward, and yet the stock market and the steel stocks are still getting crushed.  The 2 mega selloffs this week are clearly the last warning that the run on stocks is over - and Trump is WAY too prideful to crawl back from the very long limb he's climbed out on regarding the trade war.  The branch will eventually break off and fall with him along with the rest of this economy.",

I think all you stop loss guys are getting jobbed today. I've been buying at 59.15.  I think earnings are gonna smoke us to a a quick 64 - and the chances are equal that afterwards we see 58 or never see 60 again but we are on our way up. I'm betting this time its different.

This evening I will either be Celebrating or in Mourning. LOL! Options activity indicates an at least 7% move UP or Down. I figure I picked these shares when they were down -5% this morning and I have the worst already priced into these shares.

I'm in agreement with VanWelij and kojacks because this scenario has happened before so I expect a selloff and then a nice move higher.  Unlike the writer I think MU has quite a bit more upside to go. The fundamentals haven't changed and management has shown they have a good grip on how to position for the future. What was once a cyclical arena has now changed and we will start to see that change in the years ahead.,

"Nice write-up. Where I would disagree with you is on commodification of cannabis, as a whole. While I agree that a certain segment of the sector will become commodified, that will be the cannabis used for edibles and other derivative products. The flower that people will smoke and vaporize and the cannabis used to make the best concentrates, will be highly differentiated not only through branding, but through the incredible diversity of cannabis, itself. There are thousands of cannabis strains and the variation across cannabis strains is incredible. They come in a vast array of flavors, smells, colors and appearances, effects, and potency's. There are strains that taste exactly like fresh tangerines and just about every kind of fruit you can imagine, strains that taste and smell like fuel, pine, pepper, and I could go on and on. I used to own a medical cannabis dispensary in Colorado, and I grew cannabis for many years before going into finance. I can tell you with certainty that consumers tastes and preferences for different kinds of cannabis varies substantially, and they are always on the lookout for new flavors. So I agree with Cronos CEO, and think he understands the plant and the consumers better than most management and investors in the sector. Here is an article I published on this topic, a few weeks ago. https://seekingalpha.c...  Follow me for more analysis of the cannabis sector. And again, nice article.",

"Gary and others:  Differentiating product is going to be very important.  Is anyone familiar with Illumina (ILMN)?  Ilumina sells genetic-sequencing machines.  Per Michael Robinson, “Illumina’s sequencing machines help cannabis analytics labs identify marijuana’s 800 million base pairs and 10 chromosomes. That information will help pot breeders discover more markers for specific traits like potency, aroma, and, most importantly, medicinal properties.  And as more jurisdictions bring legal weed online, including full legalization in Canada and Massachusetts this summer, the market’s desire for ever-refined and differentiated products will only grow.  That will keep Illumina’s product line in steep demand by those marijuana testing labs’ seeking to build out their knowledge of the plant’s genome.”",

This stock is worth very little because of the company has zero to know traction in the hematology community. There more drugs coming down the pipeline that are far more promising. If Geron was going to take off it would have already. There are very few patients on the drug today because its not as effective as other options. If you look at INFN with early phase MF patients its far more effective for patients and patients are living longer when INFN works.,

One of the most stupid analysis I have read thus far. Geron should have enrolled ECOg 3 pts? You must be aware that these pts are bed /couch ridden for the most part.Maybe they should have enrolled dead pts to satisfy your foolishness.Overall survival has not been reached which might tell you that it is still too early to separate dosage specific survival.This is not provenge. There are other measurable objective criteria for improvement of disease.,
"Gern has not made much progress in price really, when you think about it....has only doubled from $3 and price still volatile.  Hopefully up 40% from here to $10....",
NASDAQ released 3-15 18 short interest figures and GERN shows just over 37 mill shares short up from the 2-28 figure of 35.5 mill short.  The really important figure on short interest will be the 4-1 figures as these will cover the large vol and price jump GERN has had!,
It looks like GERN is going to explode,
"From a recent piece on this fellow:“Mangrove has had a successful record of shorting biotech shares, though it doesn’t always win.

Test results, however, turned out positive—good news for chemo patients, but not so much for Mangrove. It covered at a loss.”Seems like deja vu ;)Full link:http://bit.ly/2G8cRht",

"So let me ask you, Nathaniel August, a few questions. I would appreciate an answer. This is in regards to your three profound articles on Geron which all call basically for Geron's demise:Do you, Mr. August, really believe what you are writing? What short positions do you put on ""prior"" to writing these articles? Aside from profit motive, what reason do you have to post these articles? Anyone who understands the basics about Geron would know how to undermine everything accomplished in articles by skewing statistics, making up one's own statistics, and basically lying. Is the ability to work the system is your MO?Why have you decided to post on Twitter statements against myself and MTB? I can only imagine the wealth you've generated by your system, wealth gained at the expense of others.At first I thought you were short a massive amount of Geron after your first article and needed to bail out of the short. I now question that. Do you put on shorts prior to all hit articles, never being in a stock for longer then a few hours? Do you buy very close expiration puts just outside the strike price so they would have maximum leverage and volatility?Rather than having my posts deleted why don't you try and answer my questions. These are valid questions regarding your three articles and would like some answers. Why don't you and I have a dialogue on this article about your three Geron articles, back-to-back-to-back.",

"blackmarango   -  GERNRemember you have according to many sites just over 164 mill total shares outstanding  --current float of about 159 mill shares -- , so with about 38% insider and institutional ownership you still have a float of 98 million shares +.  Also the brokerage firms automatically put your shares into a margin acct which means they can loan them, so.unless you specify different  they are available to loan as for shorts. Does not matter if small investors or large, the total shares being held by a firm  are in a pool the firms work from.   Brokerage firms make good money doing this, so glad to loan shares.  If using 35+ mill shares short+ there are still 65 mill shares available to loan.  Will be so interesting to see both the next report of shorts, but especially the 4-1 report if GERN holds in or betters this current price.",
"po: as you mentioned, we won't see what the shorts did during the actual PPS run up and high volume days until later.But, a little bit of me is still wondering where 35.5 million actual shares would come from IF the Big Boys did NOT sell???  Even with about 23 days to cover, that's a lot of shares to come up with especially with many of the ""little"" investors sitting on the side waiting on the sidelines for post Q3 results.So, could we reach $10, $20 or higher in the next 23 days?Wait'n and Watch'n!",
"telomarese - blackmarango - 	lehungGlad this info was helpful.  Not to pick on Yahoo Finance but they have really declined as to their info quality and accuracy.  Yahoo has had so many reorgs over recent years, greatly reduced their staffing,  and it has really shown up in a negative way on their finance site. It is sad because some years ago they were much better and reliable.  Main thing I have found is NASDAQ info is correct, just wish they would or could publish the short data a little quicker but know they are dependent on others reporting.  As to short interest on GERN if you look at the daily report the short interest is growing.  Will be very interested to see the March 15 figure, but so much of the jump came after that the 4-1 number will show the main pop and short results.  All you folks have a great weekend.",

Great Job they proclaimed!But, what if the blind squirrel had nested in a sweet gum tree?Food for thought?!?!?!And what about the notion of new acquisitions (large money sinks!).  No acorns on them!!!Of course, IMO.",
"Does anyone have the data streams where they can list the number of shorts at the end of last Friday and then, again, at today's close?I'm wondering how many shorts were actually able to cover!",
one thing I haven't seen mentioned in the last couple of days is how unlucky we are. we face a market that loses 1150 points on the dow in 2 days when this stock has wanted to skyrocket. I think we close at 7.50 today if we didn't face those kind of headwinds.,
"unfortunate fact is that these days all financial writers, commentators, analysts, everyone large and small, are  utterly without credibility. All do what they do to deliberately, manipulate investors with an eye to exploiting uninformed money. Markets have become nothing but smoke, mirrors, and deception.  Even the most skeptical, cynical generally are naive optimists and end up shocked by how bad things are when they initially start following todays markets and financial media.",
"Thanks AE for a well-reasoned analysis. Patient demographics are a critical piece to interpreting the efficacy of any clinical trial, and particularly uncontrolled studies.The truth is we don't know yet the demographics of the patient population, or what the actual median OS will turn out to be. A short position now is a bet that when those come to light, they will (1) show that IMBark is no better than truly comparable historical controls, and (2) the market will actually understand this (or JNJ will walk away) and react accordingly.Given how willing the bulls are to ignore your assessment, I'd bet they'll ignore your analysis even if the facts come out in your favor. And large companies have all kinds of (bad) reasons for not walking away from products when they should. So the patient approach will be to wait for (1) to occur (significant derisking), and take a short position when (2) does not follow immediately. Or if it's clear that GERN will continue on to a Phase 3 study, you could short after this has built even more excitement for the stock.  In the meantime, though, no reason to fight the current excitement. If anything, waiting will let you get a better price when you place your short bet. Disclosure:  I have no position in GERN",

"One of the reasons that I have been in Geron for all these many years is the high level of analysis and research brought to bear by my 'friends' here in the SA comments section.  To that end, and having done some digging of my own, I'm happy to provide a link to the transcript from the lawsuit against Alpha Exposure for stock manipulation.  This is publicly available information.  The ultimate irony is that AE and his partners' defense is their First Amendment right to free speech and yet he is the person threatening defamation of character here for anyone claiming he is a manipulator.  You can't have it both ways AE.  You can't say things about people and companies and claim you are covered by freedom of speech but then disregard that same right of others when they say something YOU disagree with.  I suggest we keep it safe and say that he is an 'accused manipulator' which is factually true. If you'd like to see the exact extent with which AE and his partners are accused of lying I suggest you scroll down through the transcript to page 40 and start off by reading the plaintiff's complaints.  They are VERY elucidating.  The attorney for the plaintiff is Mr. Bowe and he does a good job of summarizing their position in just a few paragraphs.http://bit.ly/2FXF3nbIf the link doesn't work, go to the Supreme Court site here: http://bit.ly/2udpyCband enter the index number 653096/2017",

If  I  get taken out (which seems likely at this point) I'll take the profit and be happy, otherwise over the short term I will sell more short term calls at least through July expiration. I am guessing a decision by JNJ on continuation will be in early to mid August..Now this that said, I am trying to see if there is a good chance to .make money with options.If the author is correct, this is going down to around $1 if JNJ does not exercise their option. {I am figuring that at least for the short term the asset may still have some value and they might be able to partner it again for much less generous terms with a midcap biotech company that might be hopeful of approval on one indication as JNJ may not want it if they dont think it will get to annual sales of over 100 Million.I am thinking of buying a few puts with a strike of 3 or 4 and a few out of the money calls .",
"From the chart we can see that there are too many ""censored"" patients in patients with 100000 platelets, who disappear from the trial, so they were kicked off the curve as a straight horizontal line. This has caused the other surviving patients who are health and live longer to replace those censored patients. In other words the Anderson's chart is not very high confidence in statistics term. It should not be compared with other less censored trials.",

He states the trial had healthier patients? Really. last time I checked there are guidelines ranking a patients performance status and trial coordinators make sure both arms are balanced. I would think the IRB would pick up on errors instead of scammers. I am becoming more fed up with S.A.,

"The author also conveniently excluded any consideration of the IMerge study results when determining Imetelstat's value.   In my opinion, the significance of Imetelstat's MDS opportunity in the EU alone will be enough to justify JNJ's continuation decision and/or outright acquisition of Geron.    It's hard to imagine such an astute investor simply overlooked the very promising MDS data when determining Imetelstat's true value.",
"A user on the GERN message board over at Yahoo Finances posted something in regards to this article. Thought I’d share.I had a good chuckle reading the Alpha Exposure’s short apologetics.I hope he reads this. He asks why pts in the trial are limited to 10% blasts and 75,000/ul platelet count. Here’s why. Blasts greater than 10% is an artifact pointing towards AML, as is also severely low platelet count. We already know Imet doesn’t work as a single agent in AML, so why on Earth would you select for pts presenting AML-like conditions? Also, cytopenias are one of the adverse effects of Imet, and they occur b/c Imet is destroying the proliferating cancer cells. So why would you put pts with very low platelet counts on a drug that could press thrombocytopenia even further? By the way, all adverse events on Imet are reversible by simple dose and schedule modification.Either Alpha Exposure has no idea what he’s talking about, or he’s a short seller standing on the edge of a very tall cliff.Here’s another knee-slapper of Alpha Exposure’s. He asks why very sickly pts with ECOG over 2 are excluded. Well, let me explain. ECOG 2 doesn’t mean those pts are healthy. ECOG 2 patients can be extremely sick, but still capable of walking. We are talking about R/R pts, after all. In fact, ECOG isn’t an actual metric of health at all. It’s a GENERALIZED system of categorizing the state of the diseased patient, with ANY disease. How far does a generalized system go towards relevance in SPECIFIC diseases? THAT’S Alpha Exposure’s red flag? Seriously? ECOG? Laughable.Imbark is geared towards MF pts R/R to Rux, inter alia. The trial is designed to help THOSE people, not all “ECOG 3” pts, not AML pts, not hepatitis pts, not people with sinus infections.And the lower dose arm pts having OS benefit doesn’t detract from Imet’s efficacy. I laughed out loud at that one. Also, the 4.7 group isn’t a good placebo b/c obviously placebos should be an inert oligo... not the actual experimental drug.Lastly, Alpha Exposure doesn’t seem to understand what a median means. He wrote, “Because the median platelet count in the paper was so close to the allowed lower bound in the IMbark trial, a substantial portion of the patients followed in the MD Anderson paper would have been ineligible for Imbark.” In other words, a substantial portion of pts WOULD be eligible. This is getting long, so I’ll let Alpha Exposure figure that one out.So... Alpha Exposure, looks like you’ll have to dig up something else besides ECOG. And you did realize this was a trial for R/R MF pts? Maybe you can look for what brand latex gloves they’re using at the clinical sites? Could that be the fatal flaw in Imbark’s design?The OS signal is real. It’s unprecedented. It’s significant. Deal with it. Presenting a weak argument against Imet, despite the overwhelming strength of the data to date, across the total program, only makes Alpha Exposure look even more desperate. If there’s a legitimate problem with Imbark, you should have found something more significant than ECOG.",
"Your timing of this article with the stock price crossing 5 is uncanny.  But, it stayed above 5.",
All I hVe to say is this. Think bbbbbbbbbbefore,
"In ~5 minutes of time, I was able to determine only 11% (12 of 107) of the patients in the above cited ""well known study"" discontinued their JAK inhibitor treatment due to 'Progressive Disease'.   This seems a very important data point since other well known studies (JAKARTA-2) have concluded the 'Progressive Disease' myelofibrosis patients are the least likely to respond to further treatment.   Thus, the percentage of 'Progressive Disease' patients seems a very important statistic when attempting to compare trial populations, patient 'sickness' levels, and median OS.   This leads us to an important question regarding the IMbark trial:Q: What percentage patients experienced 'Progressive Disease' prior to their enrollment in the IMbark trial?A:  100%.   Documented progressive disease during or after JAK inhibitor therapy was part of the IMbark enrollment criteria. http://bit.ly/2DMbHlO",
"True story. Back on Oct 21, 2014, Nathaniel August, founder of Mangrove Partners, goes live on CNBC with his top short pick, WWE. http://cnb.cx/2FZQ5UTAt the time, WWE had recently launched its live streaming Over-The-Top network and Mr. August’s explained to the CNBC host that WWE would need to at least double its subscriber base from the then existing 700k to even justify its current market cap and that it was “never” going to happen. In response to that short call, WWE dropped 4% to close the day $12.51. The stock price then proceeded to rise straight up over the next few years to its current price of $38 as Over-The-Top became one of the largest live streaming networks in the USA with more than 1.5 million paid subscribers. http://bit.ly/2IHk0D8At the time, Vince McMahon, founder, and CEO of WWE, was asked by a business reporter from local Stamford newspaper The Advocate, what he thought about Mr. August, Mangrove Partners, and Mr. August’s claim that WWE would “never” be able to double its Over-The-Top subscriber base. Mr. McMahon replied (link unavailable – subscribers only), “Show me a picture of this August guy.” The reporter obliged and brought up Mangrove Partners website and showed Mr. McMahon a picture of Mr. August, whereupon Mr. McMahon exclaimed, “F*** this pencil neck geek!.”BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!...The moral: Mangrove Partners, like all of us, is entitled to voice its opinions.

"Motley Fools:  Geron Corporation Stock Still a Strong Buy?What happenedGeron Corporation (NASDAQ: GERN), a small-cap clinical-stage biotech, saw its shares rise by as much as 33.8% in early-morning trading today. Although its stock has cooled off somewhat in the interim, Geron's shares are still up by a healthy 14.8% as of 1:48 p.m. EDT Thursday. The apparent reason for this continued surge is an all-out exodus by short-sellers. As proof, Geron's stock is up on a monstrous 15 times the average daily volume today. A person walking their index and middle finger up a stack of coins.&amp;lt;img alt=""A person walking their index and middle finger up a stack of coins."" class=""Maw(100%)"" src=""http://bit.ly/2G3GcWm"" itemprop=""url""/&am...A person walking their index and middle finger up a stack of coins.MoreImage Source: Getty Images.So whatThis purported short squeeze is likely being driven by two factors:Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Geron's blood cancer collaboration for the telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, is potentially producing unprecedented clinical benefits for patients with both advanced myelofibrosis and myelodyspastic syndromes.   Geron's stock crossed over the pivotal $5 mark today. By doing so, the biotech's stock is now marginable, and a larger swath of institutional investors can buy its shares. Taken together, these two factors should be enough to make short-sellers rethink their position. Now whatPreviously, J&J has suggested that it may apply for a regulatory approval for imetelstat in advanced myelofibrosis before year's end. The good news is that imetelstat's overall survival curve for this unmet medical need seems to warrant an accelerated approval -- even without an active comparator arm or a placebo-controlled trial.The fact of the matter is that myelofibrosis patients have no viable treatment options, and imetelstat appears to be extending their lifespans in a clinically meaningful way. What does this all mean? My guess is that Geron's stock will continue to tick higher in the months ahead until imetelstat's top-line data are released. If positive -- and the trend is favorable -- I think Geron can easily reach $20 a share. However, this stock remains a high-risk growth play, and investors shouldn't risk more than they are willing to lose.",
"Who is Mangrove Partners:""Cutting-edge treatments for diseases affecting millions of Americans are threatened by Wall Street’s latest moneymaking scheme. The ploy: Hedge funds bet against a drug company’s stock price, launch attacks against the firm’s patents on its best-selling medicines and then reap windfall profits when investors panic and the stock price plummets....The Mangrove Partners Master Fund acquired a 270,000-share “short” position in VirnetX, which owns patents for a Internet-privacy technology. Within weeks of filing two reviews against VirnetX patents, Mangrove unwound its short position, profiting from an 8 percent drop in the stock price.Although these reviews can be filed against any patent, they’re particularly threatening to medicine patents and the companies that own them. David Winwood, an executive at Louisiana State University’s Biomedical Research Center, explains that “most often, a startup company’s sole asset is a patent application or issued patent, upon which the company’s fortune lays.”",

Mayo Clinic reported to state that Gerons drug RETURNS bone marrow to normal- not seen before,
I think he timed the article to make himself look good. When a stock doubles it pulls back when the stock triples it pulls back -he published exactly a triple from the 2.20 high-volume day a couple months ago he's just looking for followers because he knew it would pull back when it hit a triple from a high volume up day.,
"Imetlestat looked at patients how were high risk MF and whose disease is relapsed or refractory to JAK inhibitor treatment. This is far different then the patients population of Celgene's product. You have to also consider the patients on Lenalidomide where also given 30mg/d of oral pnednisone which makes the two products impossible to compare since you are not comparing apples to apples. These are different patients populations and different adjunct medications. Another point to address within your write up is the quote that the 4.7 mg/kg arm was essentially placebo. That those patients who achieved a response must not have been as sick since they responded to what you consider a placebo or ""placebo effect.  What you fail to include in your analysis is information on patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency which would in fact cause the therapy to remain in circulation longer and have a higher therapeutic impact. Any therapy that extends the life a terminally ill patients is most likely to get approved. Janssen is king of mining data to support an approval.",

"At least a 3 nagger was missed by shorting. Or in other words, this short probably lost 3 times initial investment.  True?",
"""Since Geron and Janssen determined the 4.7mg/kg arm was ineffective, then we should expect the 9.4mg/kg arm to outperform on a survival basis, but we haven't seen that yet, as indicated in their press release which stated: ""the median overall survival has not been reached in either dosing arm."" Since the 4.7mg/kg arm was enrolled on average earlier than the 9.4mg/kg arm, a best case would be equivalent survival rates between the arms.""Can't wrap my head around this comparison as justification of the short. You cannot statistically compare two numbers that don't exist. To conclude that that means the doses perform the same is erroneous.",
"Just a few more data points and the true value of GERN will be realized--it's foolhardy to bet against it, especially now.",
Mangrove make up your mind first you want the hospice patient included in the trial then you want those who are not intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis to be used as the bar for OS. You are comparing apples to oranges. The only study that you use is the MD Anderson study of 58 post rux patients and included patients that are not Intermediate 2 or high-risk. The other study which fits tis population better had an OS of 14 months we are at 19 month OS and counting.,

"Disease progression in MF was one of the risks for the trial design; it was unknown how these patients in an advanced state of disease progression would respond with respect to spleen size or other heme factors--any malignancy established in the spleen could take on characteristics more difficult to treat without a combo.

That JNJ applied for a recent patent to treat lymphcytic malignancies with an Imet/Venetoclax combo, as well as for a host of other heme disorders, is an interesting development.",

With their continuous disclosure, the drug seems to work in MDS patients, who doesnt have a lot of options (since Len only works with 5q deletion patients, which is 10% of MDS patients), side effects disclosed were more manageable than Lenalidomide. It is reasonable to assume it's going to P3 in Q3.",

I like to read both the potential pros and cons of an investment.....just to make sure I am not blinded one way or the other.Related to this.....if ultimately the FDA finds the imetelstat data actually has a high likelihood of extending life....which dose should the FDA approve?  At this point, what compelling reason is there to go with 9.4?  4.7 would, it seems, be safer.  No evidence of a different median OS yet between doses.....So this would lead one to believe JNJ/GERN picked the wrong primary endpoint(s) and closed a dose because it ""does not warrant further investigation"" that we are now arguing is efficacious?  We should be mad at JNJ/GERN more than anyone for these errors!",

Hey AE - starting to feel a little bit like your EXAS position eh?  You were short on that around $10 and now it trades ~$50...maybe you should move on to a different industry,
It can also mean that both dosing arms were effective in raising median OS.,

"7 month median OS is most likely for the patients with ASXL1 mutation. For the rest it appears to be 16 months after discontinuation from Jakafi. Since the trial is not actively excluding the ASXL1 patients, the numbers from IMBARK look impressive.

"once again, words from a Mayo clinic patient, this drug has been a complete miracle.  3 years later the patient posted, 3 years in remission with the first drug (Imetelstat) to provide remission in this deadly disease.  so blessed. there can be no disputing this is an active drug needed by MF patients.",
Is it really possible that this article really took away 15% of today's gain!?!?,
"Good try. So the MF population that no longer gets benefits from jakafi is healthier than sick people. Haha.  They are blowing the stats away with Imetelstat in either dose.  Hey, no mentions of PR / CR’s either. But Long money thinks that may be the case. I did see in the tea leaves some shorts may be up the creek without an OAR. Bye Bye. Or maybe BUY BUY!",
I still don't understand the fixation on MF.  a world reknown Dr Raza just told us Imetelstat will be the drug of choice for 60 percent of MDS patients.  that market is like 3x bigger then MF.    no way jnj is going to walk away from Imet just because the results could be iffy in MF.  this whole continuation hinges on MF is bologna they are telling us to keep buyout price down.,
Price target for buyout $16. price target for royalties $12,
"Your arguments are without merit.- ""If imetelstat had a positive impact on overall survival, we would expect the 9.4mg/kg dose arm to have outperformed the ineffective 4.7mg/kg arm.""  Since neither arm has reached median overall survival, your statement makes no sense.  At this point we can not say which arm produced superior results.  What we see is both doses producing a positive survival benefit which is what we would hope to see at this point with an effective drug.- ""We believe the IMbark patient population was more similar to the >100,000/ul population in the MD Anderson trial than the <100,000/ul population.""  As platelet count data hasn't been released by Geron, you should be honest and admit you hold this opinion with no basis in fact.  You have plucked numbers out of the air that support your short thesis and give the impression of a reasoned analysis, but there is no foundation - it is a guess.- ""We are short Geron with a targeted return of 90%.""  How much money have you lost so far on this very poorly timed trade?  Do you have a stop in place or have you bet the house?",

And some are saying if there's a big payday, they might sink that money into Sayona, something I think you allude to.  Despite the control talks, Altura remains undervalued.

JV  thank you for your insight and timely comments which helps me to make decision. I will stay long and will average down with AKAO. I did very well with MRNS. Great pick by you.,
I thought $10 might offer support in this scenario (cUTI approval / no BSI approval) given the price action after adcom.  I suppose the delay in C-Scape had probably added some fodder to the short's cannon given AKAO will be building a commercial infrastructure to sell only one drug for the foreseeable future.,
You said your article that the PDUFA will be a non event. You also said stay tuned? I think it's time for another article since C scape has been pushed back. You still have a $58 price target?,

"ECCMID 2018 abstracts are out. Here is what we can see from the results of Merck's imi/relebactam trial vs colistin and its implications for Plazomicin:1. Trial enrolled only 20% Enterobaceriaceae, so no conclusion could be made for activity in  CRE infections.2. There is no mortality benefit at day 28 for imi/relebactam patients.3. The trial gives an early glance at what could be the results if one compares head to head a carbapenem combo drug to colistin in CRE infections - at best same mortality rate.4. Of note is that this trial did not enroll patients with BSI and bacteria were not carbapenem resistant but only imipenem resistant.The above corroborates my opinion expressed many times during last year commenting on articles on AKAO - imi/relebactam is not going to be a competitor of Plazomicin in CRE infections.http://bit.ly/2EFBvjZ",

"Good write-up, J. There remains risk, of course, and I'd be happier with $4.8-5.2/share, but upside is hard to ignore.",
A hidden gem is the 4250 teu vessels for which they have 25. At least half are paid off. Rates just crossed $10K and appear to be on the rise. Market for these vessels are improving as the supply side tightens. This could become a sizable cash cow .,
SSW = just too volatile and risky for my tastes. I prefer the SSWA (7.125% Notes due 2027).,
Shipping is a commodity because owners cannot control freight rates and therefore charter rates which follow. It is also extremely capital intensive. Even the best get crunched in the shipping cycle The thesis is far more beholden to charter rates than is mentioned - if we are on an up-cycle then SSW will do wellCertainly with Sokol at the helm is better than previous thieving management but he got bounced from Berkshire Hathaway for insider trading My guess is that Prem Watsa and Fairfax shareholders will do very well out of the $500m investment for nearly 40% of the company,
Can you explain the Yang Ming in more detail and possible scenario’s? Is this bigger risk than 25% of capital of SSW?,
"Good job, my friend.I wanted to buy, but with future dilution, I do not even thinkWhat's the point of me grinding my little moneylol",
"Mr. Mintzmyer, question. SSW is container vessels heavily in the China/U.S. trade. At least that's my impression. And you know today there's to be a China tariff announcement. Where does that leave SSW?A partial answer I guess is, the preferreds and publicly traded note should be OK in the short term, and the commons it's hard to see how could be much worse off anyway. But after about six months out, harder to say...",
I'm more focused on G&I investing so SSW is appealing from that perspective.  I took a modest position (24% Yang Ming backing is not to be ignored).  I might add opportunistically.Good coverage as usual J - thank you!,
I'm sticking with the preferred issues only. These shipping companies love to issue stock and dilute shareholders.,
"HI J, I am long SSW as well. Also have the D and G preferred. Do you see any impact on these issues?",
"Yeah, the increased exposure to Yangming is certainly a concern - I'm still long here, but with a much smaller position than I had before the last earnings release. I put this stock in the ""show me"" category - they talk a good game, but I need to see some results.",

Spectacular success could lead to sales within a year, but by itself it's open to criticism that ""Parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus"" (the mountain labored, and gave birth to a silly mouse)--any money from epacadostat use against melanoma is just a hint of a teaser to what has excited analysts for so long.Pivotal trial of rux against acute steroid-refractory GvHD is less helpful than you'd think, because the drug is probably used as much for that condition off-label as it would be on-label.

"Geroniacs: what do you call it when a clinical trial ceases enrollment, adds an extension phase in which only survival [or not] will be noted, and there are no specific plans for next steps?  I call it discontinuation.  I could almost feel sorry for some of you: based on the initial estimate of survival after Jakafi discontinuation, imetelstat might be getting somewhere.  But the world doesn't work the way you want it to: survival after Jakafi discontinuation is about twice as long as originally guessed.  BEST case for imetelstat is FDA might entertain a proposal for a new pivotal trial.  With NO long-term survival data on imetelstat, a first-line study probably could not be enrolled (would you rather live 5+ more years, or have pretty marrow biopsy pictures).

"Here are three simple ideas to drive Starbucks revenue growth-Sell Merchanidse at their website.......starbucks shirts and coffee mugs, starbucks french presses etc. might even want to sell shirts in the stores.....Sell a refillable cup at stores and discount any refill purchase a dime or quarter or whatever, say it is to be environmentally friendly by getting rid of plastic cups but what it also does is reinforce you go to Starbucks and nowhere else and hopefully reduce waste and the cost of cups etc.  You can even put a barcode on them to track people's buying habits and tie them to a reward program if you'd like.Stabucks branded energy drink if there isn't already one.....take share from red Bull etc.....you pick up your coffee in the morning and grab a can for 3pm at work too and walk out paying $8 instead of $4.50..I'd also advocate for a smaller menu, eliminating some of the pastry stuff and concentrating on moving people in and out fast.....Toasty ""moca frap with whipped"" 54.",

I am researching the industry and do not see tariffs being a threat either and have now opened a position in SBUX.  I do think it's over stored in NA and in EU with low barriers to entry. In for short term (6 month maybe more).  I'll re evaluate then because of where economy may be headed. People will switch if economy drags.,
Well I disagree with everything that this analyst mentioned! I don’t have a position in the stock nor do I own it but I think China is being overlooked that and I have no clue as to how opening new stores could lead to a sales plunge if anything it’s a sales booster. If I am wrong let me know .,
"SBUX has cut the rewards program so drastically it is not even worth bothering with now. They now require a purchase to get the free birthday drink, which they didn't used to do. I went there for years. This is not the way to build a business. I have pretty much stopped going to SBUX because of these changes. Maybe the Chinese are the way to go. They are desperate to live through the ""American Dream.""",
Does Starbucks not sell tea? Seems to me the argument that the Chinese drink a lot of tea does not necessarily mean that they will not become Starbucks customers.,
The Starbucks I visit in Tianhe charged 42 yuan per grande late,

"New China store ea. 15 hours, very strong growing global brand, stay long!",
I conversed a month ago with an executive level manager at Starbucks he said that they plan to build a lot of stores like Panera Bread that specialize in both Pasteries and Starbucks Drinks.   Any new info on that? And wouldn’t that generate a bunch of new business income.,
"The article states:""According to Market Watch, in May 2017, Starbucks was charging $7.18 for a grande latte in China - a drink that retails for $2.75 in the U.S."" These data are GROSSLY ERRONEOUS, and I'd appreciate if the author(s) actually checked information before publishing it as fact. How do I know this?  Because I've been going to China for the past 2+ years and visiting multiple Starbucks locations in multiple cities on every trip.  And what is the beverage I order every single time (yes, boring I know)?  A grande latte, default recipe. So how about some actual facts rather than second- or third-hand nonsense? A grande latte (default recipe) costs ¥31 (thirty-one yuan) at every Starbucks location I've visited across China, including stores in Beijing, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Foshan, Guilin, Chengdu, and Sanya.  If you know China or consult a map, you'll see that's a fairly broad geographic distribution. My VISA statement from my most recent visit, for Chinese New Year one month ago, converts ¥31 to $4.89 for each grande latte.  That price is consistent with the approximately $4.30 to $5.00 range I've experienced over the past 2 years. The grande latte price has been ¥31 for at least the past year, and at no time has the exchange rate resulted in anything remotely close to $7.00.  My July 2017 visit was nearest in time to the article's purported May 2017 data point, and grande latte pricing was almost exactly as described above.  In fact, the $US converted price was actually a little *lower* than my most recent $4.89 because the exchange rate has worsened (for US consumers) in the last 6 months. And USA pricing?  The article's cited $2.75 grande latte is also bogus.  I just punched one up (again, default recipe) in the Starbucks Android app and - for the Boston, MA area at least - find it's $3.95 plus tax.  That's consistent with the two I actually ordered and consumed this week. So yes, while it's true $5.00 is an expensive beverage for most Chinese, the actual reality is Starbucks is very popular and doing brisk business in China because a growing middle class and youth population are embracing it.  Every location I've visited has been busy - with Chinese customers and not just American ex-pats like myself. Ultimately, you can believe the Starbucks China growth story or not, as you please.  But you do no one a service by promulgating disinformation based on unvetted sources. If you really care to evaluate the China story, visit China and determine the truth for yourself.  Airfares are cheap right now.",
"It's odd that this analysis seems to agree with the premise that ""oversaturation"" of coffee shops in general is the reason for slowing growth in the US, but then doesn't even provide information about the number of existing coffee shops in China against which Starbucks must compete.",
Thomas Not only is Starbucks drink addictive you can add as much sugar to it as you want without government interference in the sugar also is addictive,
Yes the US market is more or less saturated and US growth will slow but if China is now drinking only 10 times as much tea as coffee then coffee consumption is up several hundred percent over the last decade in China. It went from near zero to a definite segment of the market that is growing with a huge middle class fueling the consumption.,
"I love SBUX.   If it falls to 54/share, I will add more shares.",
"Whenever I see this ""Wall Street thinks that Starbucks' growth problem in the U.S. stems from two issues...."" First I have never met ""Wall Street"" so I don't know who that is. Secondly a quick look at 33 analyst ratings and 24 have a strong buy or buy rating and 9 have a Hold on it. If they represent Wall Street then they are bullish. But let's get above the OCD and spreadsheet stuff.  The US is less than 5% of the world's population. SBUX sells an addictive drink. SBUX just needs a fraction of the rest of the world as customers and they will double or triple or who knows how large they can get. Other food and beverage brands (McDonald's, Coke, Pepsi) have scaled the wall of worry and doubt so the road is known. You could always wait and then buy in the rear view mirror but then the price will be a lot higher.",

"Most people today are seeing right before their eyes the housing market and the housing finance system disintegrating as we speak and has been doing so for some years.  However, most people refuse to accept that and that is sad. That is called ""Denial"".Some on the Anti-GSE side are hoping that this will drive the Housing Finance System to the point of collapse and will need to be rebuilt, preferably in their favor.  That too is a ""Denial"". Once it is gone, it is gone and never to be built back to what it was.  Just look at the figures today and what they were 10-12 years ago.  We are not back there yet, even today and ten years later. If most think that we have a new set of buyers just waiting to buy a house, think again.  Old home owners are staying in their homes and would be younger house hunters finances have changed.  Older owners now have a chance to stay longer in their homes with home care and much improved health care. A younger house hunter / owner even though their wages are growing and jobs are plentiful, that is not the same as back in 2000.  Younger house hunters / owners have 5-15% Student Debt, need 3-20% for a down payment and will settle in on a mortgage that is between 25-40% of their income.  So what will they have left to live on.  Not much. Being that most of the eligible younger buyers are better educated and have better jobs, many will begin to realize that Home ownership in not an investment in their future but a liability and a draw back to their success going forward.And to think this was all done with the help and blessing of the Federal Government, US Treasury, TBTF Banks and the Financial Elites.But why am I telling you all of this, you already know this to be true.",

It was not all but just look at the suits and penalties they paid as the results of their actions.

"Did everyone see the FHFA's updated ""Motion for Summary Dismissal"" in Lamberth's court on the remanded causes of action?Link is here:http://bit.ly/2ukdpeRI am not a lawyer, but they seem to make some pretty convincing arguments - backed by substantial court precedent - that the shareholders are ""shit-out-of-luck"" here.What bothers me most is the long string of previous court decisions they cite, which basically say that it is not illegal for someone with lots of money and power to coerce the board of a publicly-traded company into implementing a deal with the shareholders' assets which greatly enriches those particular powerful people (and at the expense of everyone else who is ""lower in the capital structure"").  In short, condoning ""theft by contract"" as perfectly legal and acceptable within our society.It seems one judge somewhere took exception and implemented a new rule to protect the interests of the ""lower-ranking"" investors under a particular set of circumstances.  To which many judges expressed outrage because that ruling ""confused the law"", and have subsequently ruled repeatedly - and to every extent possible - to limit the effects of that judge's ruling.  If the board of your company takes an action to harm your interests, you may not sue them directly.  Only ""derivatively"".  Stealing your money through coercion and improper influence is fine, so long as your ""voting rights"" are not also taken.  Etc.Those rulings will have an interesting twist here, insofar as the FHFA ""assumed"" all shareholder voting rights upon implementation of the conservatorships and THEN - much later - took actions to the detriment of shareholders.  But the FHFA argues that the 3rd Amendment *itself* took away no voting rights of the shareholders (since they had long before been taken).  And since the plaintiffs have not questioned the initial conservatorships or their terms themselves - but rather only the 3rd Amendment - then they have no legally-cognizable claim.What a twisted web we weave ...As an average American, I find our laws and their interpretations by our judges to be nothing less than sickening.  After reading the FHFA's ""official"" position in our courts of law, I quite literally wanted to puke.  As a federal agency, I thought they were there to serve ""me"" and other ""average"" Americans.  But quite obviously, they do not.  I am not sure who they are representing, but it most definitely is not me or others like me.We need a new government, and new people in charge.  A vote for ""Democrat"" or ""Republican"" is, at this point, quite obviously a ""wasted"" vote.  It is time for change, and ""we the people"" have the power to make that change.  I encourage everyone to either vote 3rd party or else stay home, come the next election.  Anyone with a conscience has no other choice!",

Property must be secured or liberty cannot exist.”OUR SHARES WE HOLD ARE OUR PROPERTY.The 5th Amendment further protects property, by stating:“No person shall be … deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.”Property protection is prevalent throughout the Bill of Rights in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc amendments.

"Here is my GSE timeline:Mnuchin has stated he wants Congress to resolve the GSE's fate but suggested he'd act on his own if they can't. His time is limited and it will be harder to get Congress to resolve this issue if the democrats take back one or both houses of Congress.I doubt Congress has the desire or consensus to resolve the GSE's fate. At some point Mnuchin throws in the towel on waiting for Congress and forces the GSE's to do massive equity recaps in order to make them ""safe"" upon releasing them from the conservatorship. The warrants will be sold off to private investors as was the case in the TBTF resolution and life will go on. Look to Citibank as an example, common shares were reduced to owning 10% of what they owned before recap and preferred shares reset to par as they were spared by this method of recap. Between an equity recap and the 80% warrant dilution existing GSE common shareholders will be left with next to nothing. Preffered shares will increase about 5X.",

"Glen, with all due respect, you have to add in the disclosure, as disclaimer, that you don't have any financial studies. The concept of ""talented people"" doesn't apply in this sector but on Fine Arts, unless you are a taxi driver that wants to work for Pershing's Ackman.The current negative Net Worth and subsequents,  has already been fixed with the draw to Treasury scheduled to be effective on March 31 as always ($136 billion remainder and it's the Treasury's role in the Charter,  so no big deal). The way profitable companies are recapitalized is through allocating a portion of their profits into a restricted Retained Earnings account. Here and in the mandarin China.Furthermore,  it's common sense to expect a partial refund of the $91.7b in excess payments above the Treasury's cash infusions. If the objective of any bailout is not to make a profit, less taking into account these are GSEs.The Preferred Stocks won't get their dividend back until FnF are Adequately Capitalized by definition of what's a Preferred Stock about. Therefore,  investing in Preferreds in companies under Conservatorship is one the most stupid things I've ever seen.By the way, the concept of Net Worth Deficiency amount is the Treasury's name for the negative Net Worth written in the SPSPA, and you are referring to the amount needed to be Adequately Capitalized, so that's not the Net Worth Deficiency amount.Do us a favor and get out.Follow #Fanniegate.",

"Mister Wilbanks-Let’s have a respectful conversation and objectively analyze the gem that is novavax, a stellar biotechnology firm located in the enclaves of Gaithersburg, MD - a Mecca of science and innovation if you will.   Obviously this downtrend and any downtrend in NVAX shares is a direct result of MM’s (also known as market makers - not m&m’s and some seem tot think) sucking shares from the impatient longs.   These MM’s shake the trees and strip the weak hands of their gem shares while accumulating.   @ a market cap of $800mm to go around there are just not enough shares to go around by those who crave them, some even classifying the availability of these shares as ‘rare’Given the above dynamics, I think longs are just trying to argue that by paying a few bucks for a share today, you can turn those shares into $10-$20 per share just around the corner.  This is supported by 2 blockbuster mega drugs that will bring lines out the door willing to pay top dollar to buy.  With all this data considered, I think it is fair to assume why longs are accumulating all they can and avoiding the ‘weak hands’ theory and doing so as quietly as possible. Because once the news gets out on the nvax gem shares the BANG!   Current prices will appear as highway robbery.   Thoughts?",

This practically forced them to sell  assets cut the dividends during the 2015+ downturn in oil prices.  The oil industry is in overcapacity now and prices are supported by voluntary production constraint.  That is a very real risk for the higher leverage companies the only have upstream assets.  COP did lower their leverage with the asset sales so I expect them to weather this downturn.",
"COP was up 2% in todays heavily down market! I will be trimming COP for XOM, maybe 20%, moving for a more balance between CVX, COP and XOM.",
Long COP. Many hold a grudge over div cut. Look to the future not the past,
"LP - are you sure you didn't mean ""Story Time At Cenovus"" instead?",
The author puts too much emphasis on COP's lack of recent profits (realistically only 2015-2107).  That is to be expected for an unhedged pure E&P during a massive oil price downturn.   COP is making money at current prices and is fully exposed to further upside.  There is also plenty of flexibility to cope with volatility.  Long COP.,
"If anyone thinks COP is cooking the books, ask ENRON executive what happens---COPs leadership has a healthy sense of survival.",
Thanks for the view Long Player!I dont subscribe to your thesis however. COP was not a good investment last year at this time. However the sale of Oil Sands to CVE brought in $13.3 bil and with other actions a total of $16 bil. COP has the capital structure where they want it with great world wide assets.They are profitable at $45 Oil now as they have lowered their cost of production. I like that COP gets Brent pricing on much of its production. Discoveries up in Alaska offer growth and I recommend looking forward rather than backward to assess value. COP will be profitable looking forward. Where some major research services have $57-$58 fair value on COP I think it is a buy around $53. Few upstream companies have been able to make a full transition as COP has done and I think value will grow from here.,
LP—inevitable cyclical downturn?  Maybe. Maybe not. Oil has been in its downturn for years. Many are looking for $80 oil later this year.,
"Not a unreasonable question but one that nobody can know the answer with any certainty. But its really independent of COP analysis because if you do not believe in higher oil or at least steady oil you shouldn't be in the market for E&P companies.So, given that most who are reading about COP because they like the oil trend - and the trend is positive, especially heading into driving season...than COP is one of the better E&P.s out there: great portfolio, good opportunities to bolt on acreage up in Alaska, strong cash flow, lowering debt ratios and most importantly NO hedges - which makes it the best company to ride oil higher (if you believe that)Shark",
"Long Player-Have to respectfully disagree. At $60+ oil COP is a cashflow machine that does not hedge thus will get full value of the price of oil. Sold off Can Sands - great move to reduce debt.Company is leaner and set up very well for the rise in oil...will throw off $2.5B in cash per qtr. at $60 plus oil.Also, like MRO - will throw off an additional $500M in free cash flow at $60 oil...$1B at $70 oil...market cap is small given the portfolio.

"mikecriv... Can you elaborate on how options being exercised would lower the price? I thought that most options ended with the owner of the in-the-money option just selling the option at a profit, not actually buying shares from the option seller. Also are the number of shares subject to options contracts a significant part of the daily trading volume of this stock?",
Next week the April call options with strike price 14 and below should be executed.   Driving down the price along with market fears.  The put options have picked up for April and probably be executed closer to the expiration date.  The last week of trading before expiration should present a buying opportunity.  Below 12 looks possible.,
"Nothing weird going on with this stock.  It’s still profit taking, but it’s now just the executions of the call options..  The shorts know the call strike price options have been reached and they know they can ride along with the executions.  A matter of fact, the shorts more than likely own most of the call options.  Downside is considerable in the short term only.  Once April expiration is over or close to it (within a couple of weeks or closer to the expiration), this stock becomes a strong buy.!!  Hang in there longs.. The volatility to the downside will be over soon enough.",
I think the Omer is down today due to the wedbush analyst downgrade.. wedbush has long supported OMER. Don’t buy her reasoning for downgrade now after supporting the stock for so long.Downgrade would limit the price of stock and limit the  prospect of raising money through stock offering at higher prices.if wedbush is really worried about financial health of company and positive on OMS721 prospect( as they stated) they should stick with buy and let the stock price go up and suggest to raise money at higher stock price.just my opinion.,
Decided to play a trade on OMER.  Bought a nice position in the stock when it broke $14 dollars this morning and hedged it with a put.  We shall see over the next short period of time how it works out. I also hold a core long position that I started in late 2016 / early 2017 at approximately $10 which I expect to continue to hold on a long term basis.  OMER is not for all investors.  It's a high risk high reward play with very high volatility.  Astute option investors can improve their returns by taking advantage of the high volatility.  OMER investors need to be prepared to absorb materially loses if OMS721 doesn't deliver or the capital markets don't work in OMER's favor.Of course this is all just my two cents.  Slow and steady!  Good luck to all!,
"With the positive development on Omidria, and the consequent uptick in the stock price, one hopes management does five things:1)  Make a clear headed assessment of the investment required to bring OMS721 to market.2)  Based on #1,  a realistic assessment of Omidria sales over the next 2 years.3)  Based on #1 and #2, return to the capital markets at a higher stock price to fully fund OMS721 development. 4)  Start preparing today for when Omidria loses pass through status.  5)  If Omeros is going to continue marketing and selling Omidria on their own, they need a much better sales and marketing operation.Current shareholders are going to suffer some further dilution.  The question is how much dilution.  I hope management factors in that the best time to sell Omidria to another pharma company is now.  Today is the best price they will get for it.  Selling Omidria might be the one way Omeros can get from today to OMS721 launch (if there is one) without dilution.  Getting 2 years of pass through status stabilizes the stock while waiting for OMS721 approval, but 2 years of Omidria cash flow does not add a lot of value to the market cap of this company.  Getting a further extension is too uncertain so Omidria cash flow models beyond 2 years will be heavily discounted.I am will remain long in this stock.  I just hope that management learned important lessons from this episode.",
what are the key dates apart from this Friday,
There are now two gaping holes in the chart for the recent time period.  History and technical rules tell us these gaps in a chart get filled.  So a low teen entry point could still become available.  One can always hope for a miracle as well.,
$15 to $16 would be an ok entry point.  I will wait and see.  A market down day would be a better buy scenario.  Good luck everyone.  Long term looks good.  Short term was all premarket.  It’s a hold.,

ARNA is going to test Ralinepag as a first line oral treatment for PAH.   ARNA could eventually own the market.,
"Let's examine what Arena has recently discovered and consider some of the attributes associated with them...1. Lorcaserin - a marketing failure, but a scientific victory as Arena successfully targeted the right receptor associated with satiety.  Maybe not a perfect hit, but just left of bullseye.2. Ralinepag - another apparent on-target drug that aims to be the first effective orally administered drug for PAH.  This discovery includes a significantly approved half life that makes oral use practical where every other option has to be via IV.3. Eltrasimod - Higher selectivity once again that results in a safer drug than Ozanimod and it appears at this point that it could also have greater efficacy (Arena's Ph II UC trial was a population that included many who failed other treatments),  This is looking like a bullseye.4. APD 371 - Another center shot?  Remember Behan talking about the internalization characteristics of 371 and, coupled with its selectivity, a possible pain killer with no addictive properties, no tolerance build-up and so far in animal pain tests, relief that was described as being as effective as morphine.And ARNA trades at about 25% the market cap that Receptos did when Celgene bought them for Ozanimod alone - 7 billion.",

"Nice article, thought-provoking, pretty well written, but just a touch sloppy: the ticker symbol is PLNT, not PLFT, which occurs several times.",
"The financial statements show several alarming facts that this article doesn't address.  Book equity is negative, and that's before subtracting out goodwill and intangibles that are far larger than tangible assets.   Keep in mind PLNT counts ""customer relationships"" as a large part of its intangibles.  Shares trade at 95x 2017 earnings, which I estimate would be closer to 60x if not for this year's one time tax adjustment.  Plus, there is a very large tax obligation to prior investors, which is easily understood.  But PLNT carries an offsetting tax asset that I can't make sense off.  PLNT is a gym franchiser.  It's Income comes primarily from the franchising fee and selling equipment to franchisees.  End users' fees are a small part of PLNT's income because most of that has to go to the franchisee to pay the lease and other operating costs.  PLNT estimates it will peak at around 4000 locations, which coincidentally would offer the company sustaining revenues similar to today's with the 4 year equipment replacement cycle.  I doubt they'll get that far.  The best locations are already taken, and PLNT needs dense areas to get a large numbers of users that pay but rarely come in to be profitable at $10/month/member.  And while it's true that PLNT serves a specific market segment, there is much competition from other gyms like 24 Hour Fitness, and free alternatives like community/apartment gyms or employer provided/sponsored gyms.  I believe that's why the private equity company that brought PLNT public sold most of their shares at near $20.  Just because it's a nice place to exercise, doesn't mean that the franchiser can continue to grow profits fast enough to justify a 60x multiple.",

"I understand that Facebook and Google combined get 70% share of the US digital advertising market.  That is a huge and growing market.

But, Facebook has screwed up before, and previous screw-ups haven't badly dented its revenue.  I believe that users will continue to use Facebook.  They have already put their photos and posts on Facebook, and Facebook has such a commanding share in social media that its very unlikely any other company can erode its supremacy in the space.  I've heard that 70% of American adults currently use Facebook.  The size and scale of the FAcebook network makes it very difficult for a competitor to catch up.  If 70% of US adults use Facebook, where would you go to meet old high school or college friends?  This is a ""winner takes all"" situation, and Facebook is already the undisputed market leader.  So, I recommend that investors hold their noses and buy FB shares, which are currently on sale.

"Truly cannot understand why Adamis management is so useless and incompetent , inspite of all the noises made by investors and the market , they just continue to remain silent and continue to drag on without making a strategic stand, let alone speeding up their negotiation. Find it extremely strange for the management to take almost a year to negotiate THE DISTRIBUTORSHIP for Symjepi , either the senior management is absolutely incompetent in which case the Board should step in , unless the Board and management are equally incompetent, in which case there is no future for Adamis as distributorship is still in the air and product - Symjepi fails miserably to get to the market Feel so sad for this type of inefficiency ....worst off than those from third world ....wonder why the management is not feeling bad or shameful for not able to execute this effectively and continue to drag on.....and not getting the drug to the market after almost a year ? what a joke for both Management and the board of Adamis for failing to execute to get to market after the FDA approval almost 10 months ago ????",

The drug beclomethasone diproprionate, which ADMP uses in its inhaler has long ago been ""genericized"". A better, safer inhaled steroid, fluticasone proprionate (Flovent) was approved for asthma in US in 1994 and combined with a bronchodilator, approved by FDA as ADVAIR in 2001. Advair too now has an FDA approved generic copy.So why should anyone care about this asset?

There is now a clear path for the Oversight Board to contemporaneously seek and obtain court approval for a Settlement Agreement and COFINA Plan of Adjustment with the Title III Court by the fourth quarter of this year. Upon confirmation and consummation, the Government of Puerto Rico will reduce its debt by approximately $7 billion, increase its FY2019 sales tax revenue share by more than $360 million, and once again be able to look to use low-cost securitizations as a method for eventually re-accessing the capital markets.",

"Very well written analysis about AMBAC,but 2 Points you can add:Point 1) AMBAC had bought in the past parts of the insured book bonds with hughe discount and does not account them with the mark-to-market value, because the firm was in rehabiliation. These Value is more then $3,7 billion and more then the $3,65 bn NOL fix on shares from $5bn.Point 2) The Value of the uninsured COFINA bonds was down to 10 Cent form a Dollar and are now up to 56 Cent on a Dollar. AMBAC insured COFINA bond are traded for more then 90 Cent on a Dollar. The mark-to-market Value only here is more then $3,7 bn ($4,3 bn).Point 2,1) This point belongs to point 2, because i missed that you must say, that they court rules at the 25.4.18 about the COFINA bonds are legal. They must use the Puerto Rico Law and not the only US federal law and this is the way the COFINA are legal and must be paid from the use and sale tax.Point 3) Not so important, but you could add this too, is that AMBAC got 2 Insurance Companies and not ONE. The big one all see is the AAC. But there subdiary EVERSPAN got also an insurance licence. AMBAC can now split Everspan to an seperate Insurance Company from the AMBAC Holding without spend $2 bn to this.EVERSPAN did automobile loan insurance and student loan insurance in the past.WHAT IS THE VALUE OF AMBAC?In my kind of view, this company is undervalue and got a fair Value of $100 / share in this year on the short run. The Company earns more then $450 per share and there are only 45 million sahres out there. The factor 10 from earning to shareprice ratio = $100.Please remember all payments for the next 10 years could ambac pay from it´s reserve and more and they can now do new business.",
"Tim - you wrote a great article and you are shining a light on a very compelling opportunity. The upside potential here is tremendous and I agree that very few take the time to understand the thesis. One criticle point (you alluded to it at the start) - sadly the company does not have the ability to engage in aggressive (and accretive) buy-backs because if they reduce the share count, the ownership of certain shareholders will exceed 5% and threaten the NOLs. In fact their  corporate Articles make it impossible for anyone to own more than 5% (for now). This allows folks like us to buy in at very attractive prices. Great share.",

"Interesting article about the sale of 14 A319s to Spirit:https://yhoo.it/2Gy7qsiA few interesting things in there but one thing that stood out was that ""Spirit Airlines will generate some near-term tax savings by purchasing these airplanes, due to provisions of the recent tax reform bill that permit the ""expensing"" of capital expenditures.""I didn't realize the new capex rules applied to aircraft for airlines, this could drive up values of used aricraft as US airlines purchase aircraft instead of leasing.It sounds like Spirit was willing to overpay a bit because of the tax benefit... The average A319 is on AER's books for about $15.5 million and these 14 were sold for around $20 million.  Assuming these 14 were around average on the books then the gain should be about $4.5 million on these aircraft (around 20% margin).  I expect due to the structure of the deal they will show a very small gain or loss on sale (or write down) and a large amount of maintenance revenue for the difference in Q2.",
"Higher interest rates have generally correlated with higher rates of general inflation--remember ""the Carter economy?""If Boeing or Airbus sees rising input costs (e.g. steel, aluminum, etc.), you can bet that the next aircraft order signed will see offsetting net price increases (if not list price, certainly lower discounts from list).  This is classic behavior of an oligopoly with only two principal suppliers of new aircraft and three suppliers of engines.  Higher inflation will tend to result in higher residual values for many ""in demand"" aircraft coming off lease (after 12 years), so to some extent, this factor can help offset higher borrowing costs for AER.  And with a three to one debt to equity ratio, these inflationary effects can be leveraged.AER lease contracts and letters of intent generally provide that the lease rate is adjusted upward to compensate for interest rate increases between signing of the LOI or lease contract and aircraft delivery.On a day (yesterday) when the DJIA was down 724, it is interesting that AER closed up by $0.41 per share.",
"""issue secured bonds for lower coupon rates""I believe you mean term loans.It is more accurate to say they have been borrowing unsecured debt with longer maturities lately.Also, not saying it is impossible for AER to buy assets from GECAS or HNA but highly unlikely.",
"What’s weighing down on the stock is the known assumption that interest rates will rise and their massive order backlog will need to be financed for several years. They’re doing everything possible to minimize this effect: hedge interest rates, issue secured bonds for lower coupon rates, and take on debt early on in anticipation of rising rates. They’re a spread business and will likely see cost of debt going up. The new age fleet also sees lower lease yields just because the asset hasn’t been depreciated for a while so optically that lowers their reporting. I still think this is a deep value stock with a management team looking to execute and know the business inside and out. Looking at their main competitors are two parent companies struggling Avolon’s HNA and GECAS. Maybe something shakes out between these players over time giving AerCap an opportunistic deal.",

You mention that the number of shares outstanding have been declining due to share buy backs, but you have little to present about growth in earnings per share and growth in operating cash flow per share.  Looking at this Company on a ""per share"" basis is what you need to be doing.  AER's superior capital allocation process is what is really great about the Company.",

I followed Pabrai out.  Stays on my watchlist for consideration.  Thanks for the quality write-up and comments.  Very interesting business.,
"Nice brief write up. Funny how some people look at the sale of assets as a negative catalyst. Yes, it may be perceived as a negative development. BUT it's where we get such a large margin of safety. The ability to sell JV properties to fund future growth limits the downside. Yes it also limits the upside but that's the exact ""I win or I don't lose much"" perspective that value investors strive for. In the last write up, the article contained a lot of ""IF"" statements. Than the comments contained a lot of ""Why would I invest in IFS when I can go to STOR and get half the returns with no IFS"". My belief is that the market perception of these IFS is incorrect. At a NAV of $32, IF all of these scenarios don't work out, you don't lose much. Obviously malls trade at a discount to NAV but that the firm is increasing rent PSF 4 fold in each store SHLD vacates. Once again, the redevelopment doesn't necessarily have to work out because the organic growth in the scenario really limits the downside. My only concern (besides a SHLD bankruptcy, which I expect before 2020 and have included in my analysis), is that we see a large market hiccup before SRG development plays out. In which case, we would likely be able to see the same margin of safety in industries with better economics.",
"The question I have at this point is not whether malls are going away (they aren't entirely; a lot of class A will evolve and be fine, lower levels not so much), but the idea of whether there's ""crown jewel"" retail real estate anymore in the way the definition was say 10 years ago. I'm going to say there is, but FAR less of it falls under that definition at this point. I don't see malls going away, but I do think the attractiveness of retail real estate broadly may never be what it once was. This country is still overbuilt in terms of retail real estate and it's going to take years to work through and right size that, but on the other side of all this, mall real estate isn't going to be an attractive business.If amything, the whole Bruce Berkowitz/Sears obliteration is a tremendous case of his not realizing how neglected the stores had become and his ignoring the obvious shifts in retail as he said Sears was worth $250, then $150, then $90. People talk about Ackman and Valeant but at least that was what, a couple of years? Berkowitz stubbornly was wrong for over a decade. Berkowitz got desperate enough to suggest that maybe Amazon would look at Sears after Amazon bought WF. If anything, Amazon might pick a property or two out of bankruptcy, similar to what they're reportedly doing with Toys R Us.I don't think Seritage has THAT much to be overly thrilled about; if anything, some of the portfolio is decidedly unappealing. However, it'll probably be fine - I'm just not going to get excited about it at all, like I've thought the Sears real estate thesis has been wrong for ages (and it has been a disaster for all the Lampert fanboys.)",

Hi MichaelYesterday I saw news that NS did a “private” placement of preferreds... I have heard of such being done by other companies but can u tell me why a company would do a private placement instead of a public one?,
If you buy NS today you pay 325MM less for the Permian acquisition. This is the loss on the 14.4 MM shares issued in conjunction with the purchase. If management can focus on cost reduction and organic projects centered around American oil exports this could be a big winner.,

"Nice article, but at this juncture I don't have convictions that certain with regard to any Energy MLP. The closest thing I have to a conviction on a ""Core Position"" is Magellan, MMP, so long as they're are still selling in the <$58 Unit Price range. They don't dilute, they have 66 consecutive quarters of adding to their Distribution, NO General Partner interests or IDRs. I sold them off before they dropped under $70 and spared myself the 20+% Dip. I sold off any large Non-Trust MLPs before the end of last summer, and I'm fortunate to have. Kept Buckeye, BPL, and Enterprise, EPD, in the trust, in the exact proportional, ""Speculative"" (small) positions that still represents a large return on both since they were the last additions to the trust, around 2003. Unlike Magellan they both have dilution working against them. On the other hand Magellan is almost exclusively Oil, whereas Enterprise is Oil and Gas. However, for the next decade that should be OK at $57-58 per Unit. Of course, if U.S. oil volumes shrink from the rapid volumetric increases that have surprised many, including me, say after the long dreaded Saudi Aramco IPO, then being an Oil Midstream company confined to the ""CONUS"" region of N. America wouldn't be such a 🔥 thing to have as a ""Core Holding"" despite their current prospects. Add a 40% Return-on-Equity, year after year, and it still doesn't give me convictions. We also still have a few Units of ""Enable"" in our Discretionary Fund, but despite its good quarterly results and connections to sponsors ""OGE"", and ""CNP"", I'll pass on that one even when it dropped under $13. How about ""FERC"" raising havoc in the Midstream MLP space while a number of 🔑 pipeline projects get stalled waiting for their final connections to be permitted. Dominion Midstream ring a bell?

Michael - What chance do you place on NS ever getting bought out by VLP?  Some of the assets on the pipeline and terminal side were old VLI assets before the spin-off in 2003.  VLP has said they want to make an entry into the permian oil pipeline market as their name was mentioned in the possible acquisition of ORYX midstream along with EPD and others.  It just seems to me that VLO could drop down their remaining 1 billion EBITDA into VLP and get rid of their GP interest.  Then use their share price as currency to buy NS and everyone is happy.  San Antonio then has a 2 billion dollar plus MLP EBITDA machine where the largest shareholder is the best merchant refiner on the planet.  I guess my point is that NS is too small to go it alone.  They need to make a deal with VLP.  I think it makes sense for all.,

I agree with the author though that this is a near 100% certainty to go through.  However, I disagree in that I wish ETE had purchased them.  I think KW at Energy Transfer would dance circles around this management team, and connected with the rest of the vast ETP system, true efficiencies would emerge.  With ETP also trading very cheap, it would have been win-win for everything but the management team and their paychecks.Alas, KW was too late.  By the time he submitted an offer, the deal was struck and there would have been pretty big breakup fees.  Plus, the offer was contingent on the CEO/founder supporting the sale to ETE, and he isn't going to vote against his own paycheck or those of his friends in the executive suite.  So it was a done deal.With all that said, perhaps ETE would like to buy some storage or individual pipelines, and that could help fund the Navigator system completion.",

Physical locations offer more than just retail products. Margins will move in this industry because products are constantly offered as new or updated products. Management is smart!!! They know how to promote, build teams, and offer all formats of retail. Online sales grew UP 64%. You do not show that kind of sales growth without instore promoting and customer loyality. This stock should easily move to $250 - $300. Growth, management, and product selection with expert customer service should move this stock. Listen to their last conference call. It states exactly where this article is heading.",

"AV‑101 looks to be a better version of rapastinel (Allergan/Naurex). AV‑101 is an orally available prodrug candidate rapidly converted in vivo into its active metabolite, 7‑chlorokynurenic acid (7‑Cl‑KYNA). 7‑Cl‑KYNA is a full antagonist of the GluN1 subunit with a similar mechanism to rapastinel (note: rapastinel is a partial agonist). Regarding potency, Naurex' preclinical data shows that that AV‑101 is a more potent GlyB site modulator. Phase 1 studies showed good dose proportionality with Tmax of 1‑2 hours and a half‑life of 2‑3 hours. These data compare favorably to the half‑life of only 5‑8 minutes for rapastinel. JN.",

In essence it has been independently verified it is the same ore body separated only by the tenement boundary as the two tenements sit next to each other and each company appears to occupy approximately 50% of the ore body.

I sold the June 2018 $6 Puts no so long ago and collected $1.80 per share (i.e. 30% premium) for just over 6 months. I also own a smaller position of shares outright. So I am also becoming more optimistic now and hopefully by June I will be able to keep the premium and thus lower my cost basis on my Pandora stake (which I intend to hold for the next year or two in case a substantial rebound does materialize). Overall selling Puts on Pandora seemed a good way to build a stake in the company - in particular as Put premium was so attractive following the share price decline in 2017.,

"Stocks don't move on the basis of current fundamentals, but on the basis of future expectations. All the good things mentioned by the author were likely priced in and fully reflected as of the 2/1/18 top. The current news on FB is still in the process of being sorted out by investors - and so far the verdict is a negative one. Buying the dip of a stock that has ""always bounced back"" Is also always a risk: there will be a time when it doesn't bounce back. Buying the dip is a bet that in six months or so FB's fundamentals will have emerged from the current pullback stronger than ever. Nobody, at this time, knows whether that will be true. The author's tone strikes me as highly complacent. No matter what you can say about the current fundamentals, buying FB (or any other stock) after a dip remains a speculation.

Facebook could potentially be on the hook for 2 trillion dollars when you add up all of the liabilities that it is exposed to for each of the users data that it compromise now it probably won't receive a penalty that large obviously but the author's assertion that there is nothing to see here just doesn't hold weight and the market knows it too which is why its price has declined,

I'm sorry to say doesn't make much sense to say that the stock is undervalued if it weren't so risky it's properly valued because it's so risky,
http://bit.ly/2H2wbt5,
Saying cancer / gbm drugs are highly risky is like saying that the sun will rise in the east. rGBM existed before AIDS and treatments for AIDS have been successful -- very successful. Avastin is an approved treatment for rGBM and it doesn't improve mOS. I would think that many investors know the risk associated with TOCA (and similar) companies. But TOCA's CRs and patient testimonials (from the CRs) are credible and very intriguing. Maybe TOCA may be one of the first (like some initial AIDS treatment) to improve mOS for rGBM.,
what's so good about the results being equal to  temozolomide and surgery   why not just use that?,
Senator McCain taking tocagen? how do you know this?,
"tell me one name of a company under 200m MCAP that had succeed with a marketed drug in cancer. And mircro caps in the size of 10, 20m are too small and don´t have the money to do that. So no chance to bet on such a micro cap. TOCA with a MCAP 250m is a small cap and has a phenomenal technology where Senator McCain is involved with his rGBM - so lets see what happens. Merck will grab them sooner or later.",
...yes you should buy a boatload full of this company and you´ll feel as the richest man of the world :-)))  Sorry for my bad joke but if you believe in the dream that a 20-million-company is able to do anything what bigger pharma can´t do you better stay away from the stock market and take a visit in Vegas for a better chance :-))))),
I have been reading lately that people have been saying tocagen might fail but talking up delMar pharma with their glioma drug.,
"I looked into this company a while ago. What I noticed during my research, was that in their cited sources for previous OS in recurrent glioma, the patients receive only some kind of drug or treatment without surgery. So tocagen is comparing their protocol (surgery+treatment) vs. treatment only in their presentations. For the phase 3 trial however they compare (as is proper to do) surgery + toca 511 vs surgery + chemo. At the time I didn't find any data what median OS to expect if surgery is combined with a chemo in a recurrent glioma. But I would expect longer survival if chemo is combined with a surgery, since, especially in such an important and spatially restricted organ as the brain, a growing tumor is a huge problem, and an immediate resection of this tumor mass + an additional chemo to kill of the remaining cells should result in longer survival than chemo alone. So for now I will remain on the sidelines and watch this one closely.",
"Risky - not so risky - very risky.....it sounds a little bit laughable - let me tell you why. Investing in cancer stock is always more than a little bit risky - its very risky. You should know that and its not an unknown knowledge for an investor in this sector. Every trial in this space can run in a wrong way with results we don´t want to get. PI - PII - PIII – there´s never a guarantee for a finish with expected positive numbers. A lot of not awaited bad results from small companies or big pharma showing where the bear steps and there are more than two or three programs from companies which were stopped for different reasons. No guarantee - as I said. But tell me - have this always been only the riskiest trials? Bad trial results always means a loss for an investor - and I´m not talking about a small loss. But tell me - what is the difference in loss an investor makes with bad results from a company in a PII or a PIII trial? ....sorry - its the same...haircut called. Not so long ago there was a company named VBLT that got a haircut - do you remember if investing here was called to be risky or very risky before results were announced? ...or did someone say it´s an investment without some risks?  So for me that´s not the point. Buying stock of a company in the cancer space means I have to take a view into their former trial results. What are the facts. If they were good - fine...but a risk is always included. Not so good results - does that mean lower risk? ...laughable... If there are phenomenal last results - why should they indicate the ""high risk""? Or should I think the ""holy grail"" will never be found? Then it´s better not to invest in cancer companies. About TOCA - actually this company seems to have the best chance to win the race in rGBM - there is no competitor on a better way - last results make this hard as a rock and it´s not riskier to invest one buck here as it was to invest in VBLT with not so good numbers in their trials before they got crashed.TOCAGENS 250 mio mcap for a PIII company in this sector is ashaming cheap - but not for the called reason "" very risky"" - it´s a company flying under the radar - but how long is the question.  In a few weeks - April 14-18 we get news from them @ AACR. Unexpected positiv newsflow and there will be no chance again to buy shares for todays price.We are long invested here.",
Celldex also had a great drug for Glioblastoma.Flopped in Phase 3.,
"Although I share your distrust of subset analysis , I think the situation here is different. The subset was chosen based on delivery method , not a subset based on patient characteristics. This makes biologic sense , the dose of viral vector delivered into a surgical bed is probably 10's to 100's of orders of magnitude  higher than IV administration and/or direct injection(due to surface area and tumor volume). I also think the choice of brain tumors makes sense, its one of the few organs where the majority of normal cells are quiescent and not actively dividing. This increase selectivity and therapeutic index.",

"""CHK is in a strong downtrend, but has a chance to recover from the recent lows.""That has been true for all assets and asset classes that failed.  Nortel had some nice moves to the upside as it lost almost all of its value.  The NIKKEI wiped out the shorts even as it moved from more than 39,000 to less than 9000 by having a number of strong countertrend rallies.  But there is a point where the bounces are smaller and less frequent and CHK will be getting close to that point when free cash flows show that there is no hope of being able to pay off maturing loans.  ""Trying to catch this huge move is probably what attracts people to stocks like CHK, and also what does the most damage. If you have held for the last year, that 100% rally you looked for in the first place will only get you back to break-even.""And that is the problem.  CHK is only good at destroying capital and has yet to report a full year of positive free cash flow.  It is a dog from the point of view of fundamentals and seems to be in need of a restatement of the asset side of its balance sheet to reflect reality.  The only hope is to play the quick trade game like all of the other degenerate gamblers who use TA in the belief that their TA programs are better than the other guy's.  I see no evidence that such strategies can yield a good long-term result for the average investor.  The better strategy is to be more like Ben Graham and let the markets reflect the fundamental value of underpriced companies.  Right now that would be the conventional energy players, not the shale sector.",

This company is in better shape than it has been for the last 3 years.  Doug Lawler and management team have done a stellar job with the deck stacked against them.

The best CHK article lately as mentioned painful to hold frustrating to trade. I made the decision to hold most of my shares and in the money calls long term.

"CHK need to reduce the debt to at least 2x of ebitda, I think current it is at 4x. That much debt, it’s maintenance cost dry all the FCF. I agree we need to watch Q1 and Q2 to see if management is continue to dispose more assets and recover cash to pay down the debt.",
Last qtr was better than expected and share has recovered fromthe very lows but in order to see better prices i think we'll need at leat other 2/3 qtrs with valid numbers and possibly some consistent asset sales .,
"It seems to me that the market perceives problems at CHK more than the price of the natgas and its future prices, in both cases the price correlation is low in a 12 month time frame.

I dont know if CHK  has sold some of its better assets  in order to maintain the nose above the water. It does not look clear how to make big money with this guy.",
"I'm not in $CHK, and don't care for it. But, the explanation you gave is priceless! Specially, when someone writes: ""I'm down 20% on my portfolio because of stock abc"".

Natural gas doesn't look good atm but Oil is moving up. Will this give CHK much needed boost in stock price in the near term?,
"Andrew, I don't have a position in CHK but have done cycle work on it. From the Feb 8th, 2016 low of 1.50, it made either a wave (A) or 1 high of 8.20 on the week of Dec 12th, 2016. The recent low of 2.53 is in the window for a 23 month cycle trough, which I would tentatively label as wave (B) my preferred count, suggesting a wave (C) target in the 12.00 area in March of 2019 and that the current price should move sideways to a bit lower into April 2018 (still within the 23 month cycle low window), then move up over time. Cycles on Nat Gas are currently not clearly in alignment with this projection. The long term cycles in Nat Gas suggest a sideways move - some upside this year - with an 'a' low in July 2019 in the 2.40 area, followed by a 'b' move to 3.60 area in the spring of 2020, followed by a 'c' move and major cycle low in the 1.60 area in early 2021 that should be aggressively bought.",

"Good article, but everything Google has tried in terms of hardware has failed (except, as Glen once wisely pointed out, wifi routers lol).Why should one assume that driverless cars would be a success. And anyway, according to reports Apple is testing way more of such cars than Google...and Apple has indeed more than succeeded in all of their hardware products (not including w/Homepod.. its too soon to tell).Also, who would trust Google with even more of their info.Sounds like a lot of risks to me.. I would not invest. Keep in mind these additional risks:1. True one trick pony - with over 90% profits coming from ads.2. Risk of Apple getting into search is there.3. All hardware products (except wifi routers lol) are big flops...vs Apple's which are all runaway successes...gaining market share in almost all markets for all products and services.4. Google's Pixel phone is a flop and pretty pathetic see stats:http://bit.ly/2FGUjRS5. CNN, NYT, POTUS and Congress all have it out for Google...likely just a matter of time before something is done about their unfair, shady and monopolistic practices:http://bit.ly/2FFt3U9http://nyti.ms/2BF4I0G6. Just as a matter of principle, I don't agree with investing in a company that runs a monopoly (all monopolies at risk of being broken), spies on users, and is biased and unfair in how it ranks things in it's search.7. They don't know how to play in China, the most important market for the future (Apple, however, does).8. Google missed earnings estimates, while Apple beat.9. Apple pay is responsible for 90 -95% of all contactless transactions. This one stat gives a window into what the future is, and who will dominate it (hint: Apple..and not..Google).10. Apple has an ecosystem firing on all cylinders....Google mainly just has its ad business (please spare us the stats of how its other minuscule 'other' ventures are growing fantastically).",
I have 1 question. Has anybody totally considered the possibility of autonomous car hacking just like has happened with computer hacking? I think it's a very real possibility and the biggest reason that fully autonomous cars will not make significant progress in our lifetime. Plus I also believe most people don't want fully autonomous vehicles. Consumer interest will likely be  relatively low compared to the hype.,
They are nowhere near Level 5.,
"Comparing the accident rate of human drivers vs AV is not a good matrix for the eventual large scale adoption of level 5.  When a human driver gets in an accident, he assumes the liability for himself, ie. the probability of getting sued is distributed over the whole society.  When an AV gets in an accident, the car manufacturer gets sued! Even if AV achieves only one accident per day per million cars, multiply it by the number of cars out there, it means getting sued daily for the car manufacturers!  With that said, level 5 won't happen until AV's accidents are so  miniscule that the car manufacturers can absorb law suits as cost of doing business.  It will happen eventually, but just not when it is only better than the humans. Furthermore, how does an AV differentiate a police officer giving you orders vs. some guy waving his hands?  It's a no brainer for a human driver to recognize a cop, but one hell of a challenge for an AV.",
"While Waymo may be further along in its research, the number here are wildly favorable to the AV industry. First of all the cost of operation per mile versus private cars in unrealistic. Several of the expenses such as fuel/electricity and maintenance, are consistent across operating modes. But operating a service will require frequent cleaning of cars, and the overhead of collecting payment and operating the service. This could be balanced against the amortization of the capital expense over more users, but most families will need a car anyway for when they travel outside of the service area. Most people also like to be able to leave their possessions in a vehicle, for example when batching together trips to several stores in one afternoon. There is also a greater risk, albeit one hard to quantify of AV vehicles being stolen or vandalized. I suspect their costs will be closer to those of traditional ride hailing services, but certainly more than private autos. Very few people could get more work done in an AV, otherwise we would see greater use of taxi services already. Things like motion sickness and lack of ergonomics are factors and to the extent work can be done remotely, people will work from home reducing demand for all travel, autonomous or not. I don't think any of the current AV competitors will make any money. If it did prove viable, competition would become intense. That said, if Google's real purpose is to distract people from its monopoly in search, it might do OK as an investment in spite of this.",
"Great article. The one GIANT thing here is that Waymo will not make cars but will sell self driving software to car makers. That means that NO single car company will have a competitive advantage over the others as Waymo would most likely seek to sell its technology to as many car companies as it can, maximizing units sold, especially while Waymo has the lead and can charge more for it. Anyone thinking that Tesla has some kind of advantage in autonomous driving is wrong then. Tesla will have to make its money selling cars, not self driving software and it will not have an advantage over the other car companies.",
Great analysis!,
"Excellent article. I totally agree. Part of the reason I have been loading up on Google stocks on recent dips is because Waymo has so much potential that hasn't been priced into the stock. As the service is commercially launched, there is huge potential for the stock to skyrocket.",
"Difficult to know, but 30% seems high (to me).  Put me in the camp of AV delivery vehicles adoption first, they will be far less dangerous to society, and are the most logical place to prove out the technology.  Its interesting, that when Warren Buffet, who has a car insurance empire in Geico (which stands to be greatly affected by AVs),  was asked if he thought if AV's would make up 10% of the market by 2027, he said he'd take the under.  Either way, its coming, and likely far faster than most believe, imho. I also think its very premature to conclude that Waymo will be the de facto industry leader here in the U.S.  I expect so much to happen by then, really just about anything is quite possible. But, its quite likely that F and GM will both be out in front in this area, since their very survival depends on it.  Also, Level 5 AV's will likely be adopted by the market place LAST (most heavily regulated)... thus, Waymo won't have any advantage over the car companies, imo.",
"Lots of mistakes and outdated charts and data.  The industry is evolving at lightning speed. You can't really make a case that Waymo is way out in front, if you don't understand where the competitors are right now.As an example: Your chart titled : ""Expected Level 4 Autonomous Vehicle Market Roll-out"" is from October 2016 and is extremely incorrect. it says that Ford and GM will have level 4 AV's by 2025...   A lot has changed since this chart was produced, including Ford buying Argo AI and committing to a mass produced AV's by 2021; And, of course, GM is clearly in the lead, petitioning the Department of Transportation to have an AV (without a steering wheel, gas pedal or brakes) driving on city streets by 2019. Will Waymo + Chrysler have that by 2019?   Also the chart and timing is incorrect with regard to just about every other manufacturer AV development schedule listed.Not to mention, there are so many flaws in Waymo's ""go-to-market"" strategy that haven't been addressed in this article.  There's a lot of shifting of strategy in the AV space right now and new partnerships are being inked all the time, so its premature to conclude Waymo, which doesn't produce the actual vehicle that its technology sits on, will be the outright winner.  There is  good reason why Ford didn't come to an agreement with Waymo, because the manufacturer would be giving away MOST OF THE MARGIN on its vehicles. Its unclear whether FCA will be willing to do so in the great volume needed for Waymo's technology to capture the market. If Waymo doesn't strike a deal with FCA, who else would implement their technology? Probably nobody, since everyone else is developing it on their own. The Big risk to Waymo is - in the end, Car companies might not play ball with them.Additionally, even *IF* Waymo some how ends up being the first to market (doubtful) - its also unclear that the regulatory landscape will be ready for full level 5 AV's - translation: AV's will only be in a geo-fenced area. Thus, level 5 is useless in that scenario.  If more deaths happen like recent UBER and Tesla accidents, expect DOT to force a slower implementation of AV's.  That will hurt Waymo the most, as everyone else will easily be able to catch up.  Many experts and futurists believe that AV's are likely to take off in a delivery role first (mush less dangerous to society), and once the technology is proved out, then passenger carrying AV's will be adopted.",

However, I watched an interview with someone close to Mr. Trump that has seen first hand his rashness and inbred need to immediately strike back when attacked and if the investigation starts to look like it is going south this person opined that there was no doubt he will fire Mueller.  The second trap is of course if Mr. Mueller is allowed to conclude his investigation and finds a prosecutable offense against the POTUS or an immediate member of his family.  The third pitfall is the enormous out of control national debt.  I cringe every time the discussion comes up and they discuss it from the viewpoint that it just breeched $21 Trillion.  The reason I cringe is this is such bs in that the real debt should include the nearly $20 Trillion in funds not in the social security trust funds and an additional $8 Trillion in matching funds they never put up to support the retirements of the baby boomers on the old Civil Service Retirement Act.

"""Technosphere is A Worthless Technology""Nothing could be further from the truth. From MannKind's website.MannKind’s dry powder formulations are based on FDA-approved excipients, including fumaryl diketopiperazine (the excipient used in Technosphere® inhalation powders) and mannitol. Our formulations result in powders that have particles within the consistent and narrow particle size range required for delivery to the deep lung, and without the need for sizing, milling, or blending. The resulting powders have a low density and are readily dispersed from our simple, patient-friendly inhalers. After inhalation, the powders dissolve rapidly at the surface of the deep lung and deliver the drug directly into the arterial circulation, bypassing the liver to provide excellent systemic exposure.Our dry powder formulation technology is compatible with a diverse assortment of drugs over a broad range of physicochemical characteristics, including molecular weight (300 – 150,000 Daltons), structure (small molecules to monoclonal antibodies), charge, and hydrophilicity/hydroph... Our dry powders are ideally suited to deliver drugs for local diseases, such asthma and COPD.  In addition, the use of our Technosphere technology for systemic conditions was validated by the FDA approval of AFREZZA® (insulin human) inhalation powder, and has also been demonstrated in clinical studies with Technosphere formulations of parathyroid hormone (PTH/Technosphere), salmon calcitonin (sCT/Technosphere), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1/Technosphere).",

The ASPART arm had a set dosing for their insulin. The Afrezza arm allowed an initial dosing and then repeated dosing—basically dosing until they get an improvement in their desired data. MannKind is comparing apples to persimmons and claiming their apple is sweeter than the persimmons.""Afrezza can have follow-up dosings precisely due to its rapid in and out nature; subcutaneously injected insulin has that nasty little problem of ""IOB"" or insulin on board, making follow-up doses problematic and dangerous.  The real problem of the comparison test between Afrezza and conventional basal insulin was the original design of the test approved by the FDA and Mannkind... that was an unfair test and one that, unfortunately, was doomed not the reflect the VAST superiority Afrezza truly has over all basal insulins currently on the market.  Mannkind may fail as a business due to prior iterations of incompetent management, but your representation of Afrezza as simply ""another"" insulin option is myopic to the point of being deliberately deceitful.",

"Interesting that ""the market is interested in revenue growth"" yet the stock almost didn't move at all in response to the revenue growth from previous quarter. Though perhaps the stagnant share price is more the result of the entire sector lagging recently and not in response to anything Aphria specific",
When they wholesale they do not have the inherent SGA below the GM Line. So while it impacts sales EBITDA not so much. Check their investors deck. Plus they had a considerable step up in inventory due to PII production/harvest. They chose to w/s part of the step up in a 4Q deal to w/s plants to Scientus Pharma.  This was inventory smoothing.  A good strategic measure.,

"Nice wrap up of Aphria's prospects, Gary and thanks.Other than the hit they took from exiting USA, (which although it set their growth back a bit, did fill their coffers with cash), I would guess the other 2 big players have the same pressures of rising sales and marketing costs to compete in Canada.   Aphria has more than doubled its revenue for the last 2 years so do you have a higher rise in sales/marketing costs as a percentage of total revenue versus the other 2 leaders?Thanks,m",
They can always buy an American company when the rules are changed. It will happen once the US goes legit. Of course that will only happen when this generation that rules America is in the grave.

Gridbird-Have you taken a look at the pricing and risk return characteristics of the other PCG preferred issues?  You may come to a different conclusion if you do a review of each issue and find specific issues trading at significantly different prices...,
good analysis!,
Definitely adding this to my list to watch,
PCG has a noncallable 6%  $25 par preferred. It is now of course a suspended dividend. So we got a suspended dividend yield preferred trading at $26 with a 5.77% yield. You dont see many low yielding preferreds trading above par with suspended dividends. Im no player. I have a safer utility preferred plus 6% and it always pays. I will stick with it.,
"why would anyone let their money sit invested in PCG? There are several good quality utilities that pay a nice dividend. How about D, DTE, WEC, NEE? They don't have Pcs problems. I want my money to work for me all the time not sit hoping some dividend will be reinstated when?",
"I like options on PCG. I bought in an IRA, a large position of PCG  common at $38.22, and then immediately wrote Jan 2019 $40 CALLS for $3.87. My stock will be called away in January, however, I will pocket $5.65 per share, or a 14.8% return.",
"For relatively small amounts of capital, aren't the preferreds a much better risk return?  Trading back to par is approximately 15% upside (above par, well-you can do the math).  The dividends are cumulating (while not being paid currently-you will get a lump sum for the past dividends upon payment being resumed) at over 5% annually.  Seems as though the return potential is the same or greater than the common---and the risk lower.  What am I missing????",
"Long since '77 and with it's high a year or so PCG represented ~15% of my retirement portfolio and about $4500 in dividends.  Being retired and living on SS + divs, I capitulated after the dividend stoppage.  I replaced it with REITS and 1099 LPs that increased my annual dividends to about $6000.  My heart goes out to the victims of the fire but also those that will see their retirements suffer (especially PG&E employees).  A big reason I sold my shares was the companies very recent demonstration of capital preservation by not increasing dividends for around 3 yrs during the San Bruno litigation.  I have no faith in their being any relief soon enough for this retiree and sadly moved on.  i might also add that as a native Northern Californian, I have little faith that the political policies of my home state will facilitate a fast conclusion.  For all that hold on I truly hope I am wrong and that soon you will be north of $55 and seeing $2 ÷ annual dividend.  My gut feeling is no div for 3-5 years.",
All the blame will never be assigned to PCG. This will be dragged out for years. There are financial tools that will prevent any thought of BK.,
"""First off, the estimated liabilities figure continues to swell in every story I read.""So, let's cut out the guesswork by middlemen, and take a gander at filed 10K.  PCG states that CA Dept. of Insurance reports the various insurers have received $11.79 billion in claims statewide for the October and December fires.  Use whatever assumptions you like to allocate to the company.  Done.  Then, add $1.1 billion for the Butte liability, as reflected in the 10K. ""Secondly, inverse condemnation is an overblown fear.""Comforting, please let Geisha Williams know, since she pounded the issue very hard during the 4Q conference call.  Quoting:  ""As many of you already know, the biggest factor underlying the current uncertainty (regarding the dividend) is California's application of inverse condemnation to investor-owned utility. This establishes that a utility maybe strictly liable for damages and legal fees if their equipment is found to have been the substantial cause of an event such as a wild fire, even if a company acted reasonably. It effectively makes utilities the default insurers for wild fire risks, shifting the cost to our shareholders with no assurance of rate recovery. This is simply bad public policy.We believe the legal theory behind is severely flawed and we are challenging it aggressively on three fronts. In the regulatory, legal and legislative arenas. From a regulatory perspective, we have requested a re-hearing of the CPUC in the San Diego Gas and Electric Company's wild fire cost recovery proceeding. On the legal side, we filed a motion about a month ago. There we have asked the trial court in the Butte wild fire case to reconsider its interpretation of the application of inverse condemnation given the CPUC's decision in the SDG&E case.""If you believe 'overblown fear,' does the 50% probability of adverse findings in the wildfire cases mean that the 'overblown' part equals 50%?  Otherwise, where does 50% come from?   And, why all the disjointed stuff about cash, capital spending, allowed ROE, and 'progressive regulation'?  Very confusing stuff here, maybe your next installments will offer more coherent explanations.Gamble, a well-chosen term in considering PCG as an investment case.Disclosure:   Long SCG",

"Yellen is gone, Powell is the head of the FED. One question, how do they prove PCG is responsible for the fires?

Sure the media is going to blow it out of proportion. I'm long and I think this is another great opportunity to make money. At the end of the day can they really prove PCG is responsible for the fires? My money says no.",
Excellent summation. This may be another BP but likely not. Hopefully the preferreds can dip into the teens on irrational fear before the dividend is restored.,
I don't see the stock price going down into the 30's again.  I think it has already bottomed and will inch it's way back into the high 40's or low 50's over the next 4 months. Good for a short term trade. Wildfire season will return in late July and then it will be time to exit.  The one wildcard in all this is the ever present risk of a major San Francisco Bay area earthquate which would send shares tumblng.,
"Samuel Riehn, I agree with your assessment of how regulators will handle this, likely giving PG&E a firm, but not harsh penalty here.  The underlying earnings engine for the company is still intact, and suspending the dividend both freed up cash for future liability payments and earned goodwill points with regulators, showing that the company's priority in this situation isn't just their shareholders, but all stakeholders.  As a long term investment, I think of it a matter of ""when"" the company returns to normal and reinstates its dividend.  A small fine will result in being back to normal in a year or two, while as you pointed out, a very bad scenario could still have the company on its feet in 4-5 years, or 10 years if they stretch out payments.  Regardless, low valuation now, paired with a reinstated dividend later will likely lead to some very rewarding total returns for patient investors.  Count me among them, as I'm long PCG.Thanks for the great post!",

"Sorry, I made a mistake.  Their forward dividend rate is 1.06 per share and their share count is 5.93B so the forward dividend payout is 6.29B.  Their current cash flow is 6.15B and their cash flow 6 months ago was 6.81B so their forward payout ratio based on cash flow may not end up being too good.",
"Thanks, according to Yahoo Finance, they had 6.15B of cash flow TTM and their forward dividend yield is forecast to be 5.7%.  Since their market cap is 21.782B, the forward dividend payout is 1.24B.  So assuming their cash flow stays the same (conservative assumption I think), the forward payout ratio based on cash flow is 20% which looks great.  Could higher ST rates in the US be a tailwind for investment results since premium monies will be invested at ever increasing rates due the zealous Fed?Despite all these positives, Brexit makes me hesitant.",

"So far this article and the subsequent one released by Hindenburg yesterday afternoon after 5:oo p.m have had only limited impact on the stock price today.

As one of the largest players in the Canadian green rush I would expect Aphria's Mgnt to operate professionally and with integrity befitting it's stature.

"Basically to summarize all of this the affairs are pointing to the shady reputation of two individuals : Honig and DeFrancesco. What i am questioning is how well-reputed experts both in their field of expertise , as Mr.  Vic Neufeld and Mr. Ronald Schmeichel , got involved in this,  I trust they both will be very busy since this publication to act and respond accordingly .I must agree this article is detailed and well written - we need these kind of investigations - yet i am not charmed by the factual news , being heavely invested LT in APH. The fact that this article is written by a person short on NUU (and will roll over to APH) is not giving more credibility to stated information , it's giving an overall feel and smell of dirty garbage bag filling personal interest.",
With the NUU acquisition closing this Friday looks like major news is coming our way next week with APH's Vic scheduling an interview with media on Wednesday. Will he announce AI's spinoff then ? Is that why shorts are getting nervous ?,
"Before shareholders who are and have been LONG Aphria back out of their positions, I encourage you to do your own due diligence and research and not react immediately and sell based on the information provided in this article.For those attempting to analyze the validity of Hindenburg Research's provided information, I suggest looking at some of Hindenburg's previous articles, most of which are written to instill fear and uneasiness in the reader. Notice just how many of Hindenburg's articles use ""Red Flags"" in the title of the article and also take note of how the articles are structured very similarly as this one. Further, Hindenburg Research has no problem slamming Aphria for lack of disclosure, and yet take note of how Hindenburg does not have a public website / they require an email just to gain admittance to that sketchy site. That should raise eyebrows for any reader contemplating the contents of this article.I am long Aphria",
"Is there any chance that Aprhia cn back out of this, given the maelstorm of criticism that might seriously affect Aphria's reputation?",
Dumped all my shares at 10.95. Doubled my money but will sit on sidelines until they sort out mess.,
"You guys do realize that the first line under Hindenburg's profile description is ""Hindenburg Investment Research specializes in forensic research and activist short-selling.""?They are using a lot of speculative language here and admit to shorting Nuuvera?Hello? Flag anyone?",
Great article,
"I still believe on Aphria, but really they should soon fire the board members who were responsible for the nuuvera deal and go to justice to cancel nuuvera's deal, because of fraud.",
I'd be very interested in what Ted Ohashi thinks of this. He knows the most about the management involved in the big cannabis players. To outsiders like me this article looks a bit speculative and founded on rumor but it does raise red flags worth further research,
Vic has never been in any issues like the others that I could find.  I believe in what he has built and I don’t think he would jeopardize it and himself.  They for sure overpaid but look at aurora what would you call that!  Overseas is a bigger play than Canada and way more profitable. Look at the population size and how much more liberal it is out there.  Sometimes you got to spend money to make money but I don’t agree with the amount they paid.,
"Great article! I am long Aphria, but this seems troubling. Would love to hear more thoughts on this. Clearly Aphria overpaid for this company, but what was the KEY reason they went after them in the first place? And who was doing the due diligence?",
I dont know how to react to this,
Doesn't look good for Aphria,
Total BS. You are short and spewing toxic waste.,
Did you look into Ron Schmeichel's background beyond Concordia? Wondering about that and will do so myself.,
Convinced me! Out at $11.00. After reading about Riot Blockchain it was a no brainer to cash out of Aphria.Have to really question the management of Aphria. Very shady all the way around!,
835 million is too much for too little why not Abccf or,
I have heard those names before and it turned out bad. That makes their USA co a sell also,

"I like how Antibe have hired a group of people who have made some bigs deals in the past, to focus on partnership deal. I know they will not come out in a new release and talk about the progress but I'm sure they are hard at work behind the scenes. When I think about how the stock went down and how long its been down, I think about them earning there money.",
"Whenever I feel like an investment is taking time to get going I always try and remember  this quote: ""Successful Investing takes time, discipline and patience. No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: You can't produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant."" - Warren Buffett",
Such a long road!,
"It should be noted,After Phase 2B Part 1 there was inhibition also observed with the two lower dosage (200 mg and 150 mg). As a result, Antibe decided to expand the Phase 2B Part 2 study to 360 patients and they will also be doing full analysis of the 200 mg dosage as well. This has bumped up the cost of the study by 1.65M and part of the reason to raise capital. The good news that Antibe seems highly interested in the results of 200 mg which could mean it's effective at an even lower dosage. A few other takeaways:Antibe expects to commence Phase 3  in Q1 2020 - expected to take 2 years and approx 30M ATB-352 IND-enabling studies have commenced and are expected to conclude in calendar 2020.ATB-340 IND-enabling studies are expected to commence in 2020.",
Closing of bought deal announced today.Also Enrollment for Phase 2B Part 2 Study (effectiveness) to start in March. Top line data expected in Q3 this year. The next couple quarters for ATE will be exciting times.,
They are doing a bought deal at 0.25 - it's natural to see the share price recede to this level. Many people who are participating in this private placement may sell to net out the same position but hold warrants. That fact that they traded more then 5M shares (1/4 of PP) and held 0.25 CAD for the most part is encouraging. The main catalyst is still Part 2 results. This won't material change anything one way or the other in the end. Simply another great buying opportunity. Just my humble opinion.,
Now they are fully funded to wait out trial results.Next 2 quarters will be very interesting for Antibe.,
Also:www.cantechletter.com/...,
"s1.q4cdn.com/...New updated from Zacks, mostly the same.Also Antibe expects to start Part 2 in Feb 2019 as they are waiting for approval from health Canada which takes up to 30 days (my understanding). So expect a NR next month saying they are starting Part 2. Results still anticipated by Q2 2019.",
"Yes it was in CAD, Also they updated their Investor presentation:www.antibethera.com/...",
"Thanks CC.  Can you comment on how this affects a company like Prometic, a Canadian company facing a cash flow crunch, and how that differs from a similar sized-US company?",
"@C. C. Abbott . Thanks for keeping us updated. Having read the presentation... what could go wrong? Obviously I assume they have to sell their products in their presentation, but It seems it's a top drug in each important endpoint that need to be achieved to go to market. It seems they are fully confident that it will meet the goals since they have evidences from the previous phases,  Do you see any risky point from now on?  Apart of being aware that these kind of investment are always risky. Do you see any technical / statistic concern? like you pointed with TNXP or PLX?  Any critical phase to achieve before being too optimistic? Thanks again for your contribution.",

"CC, thanks for pointing that out.  It is a little confusing though.  Is the implication that at lower levels, H2S may be gastroprotective/ intestinally favorable, and at higher levels, may be damaging?",
"CC/ Disruptive/ Jefferam: Seems like one of the key issues will be safety/ toxicity, since H2S is known to be toxic at higher levels.  Wondering thoughts on the issue of H2S association with GI Disorders...

Thanks for thoughts.",
"Hi C.C. Abbott,I'm a little disappointed with the financials last week, mostly the milestone payments are not as lucrative as I was expecting to see. This does bring some concerns for their financial picture to make it to end of Q2 2019. Especially since we are near the warrant price due in Dec which means some may not get executed.What is your take on the results announced? I can't help but find it missing data to draw any true conclusions. How significant is the following comment ""marked inhibition was also observed with the two lower doses""? To me we are missing key information to understand to what degree the lower dosage has at succeeding.",
"OK thanks.  Is that 0.22 CAD?Despite being a penny, its been quite stable of late.",
"There is like 8 million warrants due at 0.22 in December I believe.Likely be some selling.Plus this is a penny stock,all penny stocks have volatility. Especially since the big news we are all waiting for is in Q2 2019, that's a long time to wait. There will be some who sell because they are not patient.",
Jefferam1 I noted you suspect some dips before year end. Wondering your reasoning?  Thanks.,
"Ahhhh I see now.  So the specific data is not presented, in terms of the actual transaminase elevations?",
"Thanks.  Appreciate it.  Also... are there any other drugs you are aware of that utilize an H2S moiety, either in development or to market?",
I think I missed it... there were comments on the Liver toxicity but I cant find that data?  Can anyone advise?  Thanks.,
"I think the market is reacting negatively to the Liver readouts.Even though antibe seems to chalk it up as insignificant, isn't it a pretty big risk? I mean many NSAIDs have side effects, don't think the FDA is looking to approve another one with side effects. But all that being said, if they can have similar cox inhibition with lower dosage like 150 as they are suggesting in the trial, that should significantly lower liver risk correct? If they determine go to market number is 150 or even 200, that might be all they need to prove to FDA that it is safe and well tolerable? I'm no Doctor or scientist, but it seems like the only thing standing in the way from this being a major success story is the possible liver side effects which might be resolved with lower dosage. Do you see any other major risk areas?",

A little update from the company website. Cash is better thanks to some warrants being exercised. Debt has been reduced also. http://bit.ly/2EIDuUP,
"Thanks for your 1c Hal.  First, the company has already had a successful Phase 2b trial.  It already appears ""their drug succeeds"", so what is the view on the current valuation? Second, ""massively undervalued"" doesn't quite do it for me.  Dude.  The f.d. market cap currently is about $80 million USD. How can the article suggest the stock is ""a buy"" without any indication of what the stock may be worth in the future?  Investing is about risk (and anyone like you knows what the downside is here) and reward,  weighted by subjective probabilities, over a certain time period.  How much reward does the author require over what time period to justify her recommendation of the stock as a ""buy""?  How much revenue might this drug generate and when?  How big is the market and what share might this drug obtain?  What might a pharma pay for it does she think?  What might a licensing deal look like economically? At what price would she be a seller of the stock? What risks remain and what is the probability of ""success"" here? Etc. This kind of analysis is biotech investing 101.  The article is long on description and some nice info on the science etc, whch is much appreciated, but there is zero analysis or opinion of the financial reward in the ""risk/reward"". So-what's the view on potential valuation?  Bueller? Bueller?  It's a very simple question, actually.  And I would suggest that someone without a decent estimate of such valuation is actually the one with ""no clue"", and someone I am happy to take advantage of in the market for microcap biopharma stocks.GLTA.",
"mrskeptical if you're trying to value a microcap biopharma in phase 2 you have no clue what you're doing here. There are no revenues, these little companies burn cash, you're investing in looks 2 or 3 years down the road. This isn't Pfizer or Boeing. Basically, if their drug succeeds, they will turn out to be massively undervalued. If it fails, they were massively overvalued. Lol that's how it works in small bio dude.",
"The Management Discussion and Analysis dated 2/26/18 states the company expects their commercial division, Citagenix  to benefit materially from general key initiatives, with an anticipated result in growth and improved profitability for that division by fiscal 2019.  If successful, that should add leverage to funding efforts.",
"Error, wrong stock",
"Given that the several pain studies have found a combination of one Ibuprofen (200mg) along with one Acetaminophen (500mg) far more effective than 15 mg of Oxycodone or two tablets of Percoet (5mg), I don't understand why in the world doctors and dentists are still prescribing Opioids with the high risk of addiction/death and other unpleasant side effects (constipation etc...).This bodes well for the future of Antibe.",
"Anyhow,   outlook inspired me to buy more ATBPF  in Frankfurt.",
Maybe that Yahoo is not the best free source to see what´s driving a course. Antibe down by 9%.Downgraded by a reputable source? Buying opportunity?,
"Great article C.C. - These type of stocks seem to be like airplanes trying to take off before they run out of runway. But there is usually money for good ideas, so they'll be able to get some type of funding. The easiest (and most dangerous) would be convertible preferred. These types of notes carry a small interest rate (which seems attractive) but have a major flaw as they allow the holders to get a free short on the stock. (i.e. they can ""cover"" their short by the convert nature of the note). If they don't get repaid - that's ok because the equity would go to zero and they are hedged by the short.I would rather they just issue equity and align everyone's interests.",
"Not to mention the next study will be to determine the go to market dosage. This efficacy study will help determine the minimalist effective dosage to go to market. It will by virtue further validate the previous study on how effective it is.Even though they have already proved there was statistical significance in the efficacy of their previous study you are concerned about, feel free to stay on the sidelines till this next study is complete with the expected topline data to be available in Q4 2018. I know I'll be happy I didn't stay on the sidelines for this study.",
"Here's the thing: The Antibe study compared 250mg ATB-346 once daily  vs.  500 mg of naproxen twice-daily. So basically they gave people 1/4 of the amount as the control group and they claim ATB-346 has a better ulceration rate? Well duh. They gave a signficantly lower dose of ATB-346 than the naproxen group, so of course the ulceration rate was much less. This doesn't prove anything. A real comparison would be 500mg of ATB-346 twice daily vs  500 mg of naproxen twice-daily. The only way this study makes sense is if 250mg is proven to be equivalent to  500 mg of naproxen twice-daily for reducing pain, but I don't see any study that proves this effectiveness as they didn't do a controlled study of this as far as I can tell. They just have a tiny study in 12 patients that says 250mg of ATB-346 reduced pain effectively based on the WOMAC pain scale. There was no control in this study, so it's not relevant really. They can't claim based on this study that 250mg of ATB-346 is proven to be equivalent to  500 mg of naproxen twice-daily for reducing pain. Scientifically, why would 250mg of  ATB-346 be equivalent to 500 mg of naproxen twice-daily for reducing pain?",
"No idea what this company should be worth, but they currently have approximately 250 million shares  fully diluted (including all options, warrants etc) and had only $1.5 million in the bank on 12/31/17. With a burn rate of $1.5 million a quarter, that means they are presumably out of cash in a few weeks. So whatever you think it's worth in the future, they still need to raise tons of cash right now to stay in business and continue trials etc. Probably best to wait till they sell a bunch of shares before getting in.",
"Why did this even Tanked so hard today, Does not make sense! Im down huge :-( geezus!",
"C.C. Just so I understand correctly,""Given the ongoing opioid crisis in the US and globally, the non-additive property of ATB-352 can play a significant role'Should non-additive be non-addictive? Thanks.",
"Hi C.C., I am baffled by the simplicity of this patent and as why Bayer would not have thought about it during the development of Naproxen. What H2S drawbacks could have stopped bayer to do it in the first place. I was wondering if this could be detrimental to the potention valuation of Antibe as the intellectual property do not seem very solid and easily replicable. Furthermore, ATB346 is not FDA approved yet so that gives us a limited period of time before the patent expire hence a limited buyout value.Do you think this has the potential to become one of those drugs that could reach sales of 1B$ in its first year.Thanks for your article and I am looking forward to your reply.",
"Many Thanks CC for your update!! Just one question....Is it already proved ATB-346 efficacy as Anti-Inflammatory? Which are the other goals that ATB-346 have to achive in the Q4-2018? Again, Grateful for openning us this biotech world from science perspective.",
Any other drug companies trialing similar drugs?,
What are the views on an appropriate valuation for the company given this successful 2b trial?  what might a royalty deal look like in terms of revenue to the company?,

Many thanx for this tip. I bought in @0.9 after your first article where you said this is one of your most promising stocks. Glad I followed your advice.,
"Given that opioids prescriptions are likely going to be drastically cut in coming years, this looks like a very good speculative play.",
Very nice article Ms Abbott!As a long time dog owner we have had several dogs that over the course of their lives have had to take Rimadyl (Pfizer) which has a complete stranglehold in the veterinary market as a widely prescribed arthritis and general pain reliever.  As you may or may not be aware Rimadyl is extremely harsh on a dogs stomach and liver. I believe  Antibe's lead drug candidate ATB-346 while no doubt will be a major player for humans. It is my hope that they might also recognize the tremendous opportunity that the Veterinary market could also represent as I believe their new drug  could potentially dethrone Rimadyl in the Veterinary market which I think would be huge.,

Facebook could potentially be on the hook for 2 trillion dollars when you add up all of the liabilities for each user it could face for compromising their data there are very real risk here and the market knows it which is why Facebook is selling off on the highest volume on the chart I don't think this is just a short-term blip and next week everything will be fine again,
The people buying FB need to think about this;The new EU regulations coming (which could easily be adopted in the US) will restrict the amount of data FB can onsell to advertisers - which will then reduce the value/price of advertisments on FB by an estimated 60%......,
Zuck and Sandra should stop jet setting across the globe as social justice warriors forcing their liberal policies on everyone and pay a little more attention to the company that they supposedly run. I will also wait a bit before starting a position in FB as I think there is more downside.,

"I'm hoping a tech expert will help to educate me. I've had some thoughts about how Facebook could improve their data security, but as I'm not a tech expert I'm probably wrong. Reports that Cambridge Analytica harvested profiles suggests that Facebook sends out personal data. I don't see any need to do that, except when required by courts or sometimes when national security is involved. Maybe Facebook could build a system where firms run software on Facebook's servers, set up so they only get back info relating to the success of targeting adverts. Suppose a firm designs an advert aimed at American women in their forties. They trial it in a few locations, using their own software but running on Facebook's servers. The servers would be in a zone where the only allowed output to the client is triples of - data about the advert, the selection criteria and success rate (click-throughs). Of course big data is a lot more complicated than that, with variation in the advert and the selection criteria, guided by statistical analysis, evolutionary algorithms, and artificial intelligence. I'm supposing the ""triple"" principle could still apply. The bad guys could find ways of signaling personal data or smuggling it out in the 'triples'. Hopefully, that would result in a suspiciously high data rate when applied to millions of profiles. By keeping copies of all the clients' code used on the system, Facebook would at least have proof of a serious breach by a client, after a data breach was discovered. It wouldn't be perfect, but neither are anti-malware products, and they're still worth using.Is that do-able, flawed but fixable, or just a load of amateur nonsense?",

The SEC should look into the millions in stock suck sold before it dropped 11%. dead cat bounce then down some more folks.,
"Zuckerburg should go to jail.  Facebook has ruined so  many lives with all the backstabbing and lies that people spread about each other.   Democracy certainly has not been enhanced by social media as far as I am concerned.  Putin and Trump love fake news as it keeps their sheeple right where they want them.  Full disclosure, I do not and never have had a Facebook or Google+ or MySpace account.",
"Don’t rush in.  Lots of time and bad press yet to come.  This will probably retest bounce at $155, before it recovers.",
Yup.... buying opportunity,
There is no precedent in our US history for how to deal with a corporation handing over the presidential election due to looking the other way on campaign ad sales of $70M. Penny wise and pound foolish. Not sure what possible punitive financial impact we could see that could justify the sell off. And I don’t think users will deleteFacebook.,
"This is all about the legacy media attacking FB to try and stop the continuing loss of ad revenue, and mind control.  The reality is all major websites collect and sell personal data in some form or another.  In addition they have “Ts & Cs” that they would refer you to if you start asking questions on how it’s used or sold.  Think browser cookies for example.The real narrative should be asking the question about how ALL internet based applications use and sell their data.  You know what they would say “Read the Terms & Conditions.”.Everyone should start asking questions to ALL internet based applications.#DeleteUsingPersonalInfo",
"Nice report. I disagree about the bad headlines, they are going to be around for awhile. This is out of FB’s hands right now. Independent people need to be brought in. I agree with the fundamentals presented, but $170 was breached, an important support level..it needs to get over that level in a hurry, to make this price movement an aberration. I see downside to $150 area. I would put buy orders in at $152.  Downward moves in the market can happen so fast, the only way to get filled is to have your limit in. Looking to get long lower. Honestly, I’m kinda pissed first Equifax and now this. I just feel that absolutely everything is known about most people.",
No end in sight.,
"Couldn’t agree more. The public has a short attention span, and in the world of corporate scandals, this one has to rank right near the bottom.GM faulty ignitions, unintended acceleration (anybody remember Toyota... nah it was 4 years ago!!), exploding phones banned from planes, fraud at Wells Fargo. People actually DIED in some of the above? Anybody remember or care? No. Facebook allowing another company to use information that everyone already knows is public, is not exciting news. I’m surprised it has gotten this much airplay. The news cycle is short, and in a couple of days, everyone will be tired of hearing about this story. Once out of the news cycle, it will be out of the consumer’s, and investors’ minds. Sure we’re gonna see congressional grandstanding in the coming weeks, but nobody watches those. Anybody think a law is going to get passed? How did that drug-pricing legislation go? Oh, they haven’t gotten around to that one yet? Just tough talk? Shocking.2 months from now the narrative will be back to FB having the best management team in the world. This is the flimsiest scandal in the history of corporate America.",
bought some shares yesterday and today. 👌🏽,
"People forget that FB has pricing power, if their costs go up, then their ad space prices will rise in correlation; just like every other business.  Prices are passed along.",

"@ Montana""Tesla will aim to achieve a burst production rate of 2,000 at the end of this month. It will announce that achievement either in its delivery announcement or soon thereafter.""Why would Tesla not disclose a 2k production rate at the time that it discloses the rest of its deliveries on April 3(ish) ? The total Q1 Model 3 deliveries are abysmal. Musk would want to distract from the poor delivery numbers by simultaneously disclosing the ~2k production rate, no? I just can't think of a scenario or reason why Tesla would want to disclose the 2k production rate after the delivery announcement.",
"Sherm78No one can give you a definitive answer to that question. Tesla almost never reacts like other stocks, or on the fundamentals, or what any chart analysis might predict. Almost 100% of the time, it has gone in the opposite direction to what I believed to be certain, on the next trading day.I can tell you with certainty that the Tesla supporters will vigorously defend every technical level, and that Tesla tends to go up on the worst of news, if there is a single glimmer of hope included.So technically, Tesla should certainly test $300, and probably should go down to test massive strength at $280. This could well take place if the markets start the week horribly. However, you need to realize that Tesla has a greater than even chance of rallying back up over $315, if the market bounces back on Monday morning. Tesla could well jump up $10-15 even if the markets continue to swoon. It is that much of an unpredictable crap shoot.",
"Does the fact that it has closed below the lower end of 310 of the previous trading range the last two days, and somewhat significantly below it on Friday, mean that the next leg lower is imminent?  It’s also been below the 200 DMA for awhile.  TA people - help me out!",
"Hmmm, so in the last few weeks of the ""crunch"" quarter, when TSLA is ostensibly supposed to reach 2500 M3's/ wk, Musk, it seems,  is nowhere  near the Fremont assembly plant. Does that ensure ""plausible deniability"" for Musk in the case seemingly good production are released and then determined later to be inaccurate?  [e.g. ""we produced 2500 M3s/wk  at the end of Q1, however, upon further investigation it has been determined many of said vehicles required substantial rework (taking several more weeks to complete) prior to being delivered to customers"" ]",
"Thanks for the article & section about bear trap is much appreciated. A bear trap could for example be spending too much time in the comment section of bear Tesla articles. Probably in same way that bulls could spend too much time on Tesla Motor Club investors threads congratulating in between themselves expecting the imminent push through $400. For example there were a few articles about poor Q1 European sales. That lead me to believe that Tesla March sales in Norway would be poor (you know, new Jaguar I-pace, coming Audi e-Tron etc...), on the contrary Tesla registrations are doing very good those last days, totally unexpected by me. So to both bears & bulls: beware of soaking up too much in your own juice.",
"Can't judge the possibility for a short squeeze but it seems to me that Tesla is slowly but surely running out of fools. There have been many things in the last few weeks that in better times would 've gotten the muppets excited again. These include peaks in stock price which imo are artificially created. Maybe the people who invest on emotions have been tricked into investing a few times too many, only to sell again when the price dropped again.And those who've done their homework, both on the long and short side, will they be impressed with a few thousand cars more or less?In other words I expect the Q1 deliveries to come and go.A possibe rating downgrade is another thing of course. as would be the CFO leaving or whatever still might happenSticking with my Tesla is running out of fools theory, I also don't expect the next capital raise to be equity.",
"Learn a lot reading these articles. Fun too!Story from Norway. There is a lot of incoming Teslas these weeks since it is end of quarter. Up till recently the ships carrying Teslas has docked at Drammen Harbor which is well situated some 20 miles from the capital. But now Tesla decided to unload the cars in our neighboring country Sweden instead and use carrier trailers from there. Operated by a Lithuanian trailer company which probably was very price competitive.Add winter and what could possibly go wrong.Two weeks ago came the first reports of trailers full of Teslas being stopped by the Norweigan authorites  The vehicles were not allowed to be used on Norwegian roads because of technical deficiencies like running on summer tires and brakes not working. The public also picked up on the fun in Teslas being transported on old crap trailers with Euro3 diesel engines which pollute 10 times more than the current Euro6 engines. When asked, a Tesla representative said that they couldn't use the more convenient harbor at Drammen because of temporary capacity problems. As for the shoddy trailers Tesla stated  that they would contact the transport company.Yesterday and today it happens again. Trailers with Teslas are stopped and prohibited operating until technical problems are fixed. This time the press has done a little homework and found out that there has been no capacity problems at Drammen Harbor so that couldn't be the reason for not continuing using Drammen. When confronted, Tesla stated something like ""By capacity problems at Drammen Harbor we really meant capacity problems other places IF we chose Drammen Harbor"". As for the sorry state of the trailers Tesla just repeated what they said two weeks ago and said they would contact the transport company.Bonus: One of the Lithuanian trailers evaded the technical inspection at the border and slipped through without being checked. That trailer was later that day involved in a collision with a van.",
"I see today as of this posting that The Elon has launched his latest attempt to rally the stock. It's a tweet showing a Model X pulling a boring company car. I am sure it will do something for the ""TESLA IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!"" crowd, but surely people are starting to see these stunts for what they are. Merely stunts, besides I seem to remember a commercial with a pickup towing a jumbo jet, still didn't make a dent in F-150 sales so yeah.",
the rumour is that elon is trying to get a 10.000 M3 runrate in the final 4 seconds of Q1 ...what if that 10.000 M3 runrate lasts for 6 seconds?,
Thanks Montana. I am a ltille bit confused by this article. You mention a bear trap but what you are expecting is actually not a bear trap but a bull trap: a steep but short lived recovery of the share within the downtrend.,
"Montana:  Fantastic article, seriously, well written.  You addressed a question I was pondering regarding deposits. As you will know, there have been M3 cancellations and I have heard that processing will take 3 months, so conveniently past the March 31st reporting date, having said this, one fully paid roadster can cover a substantial portion of the deposits which are again, not conveniently broken down to models.  Furthermore, I have heard you can cancel your reservation, obtain your deposit back and still hold your reservation which I thought Tesla could manipulate only stating reservations, NOT current reservations WITH deposits.  You quote a Moody's covenant as follows:""if the level of Model 3 reservations supported by $1,000 deposits fall from the current level of 455,000 to below 350,000.""The keyword is ""supported by $1,000 deposits"" ...Obviously Tesla will not disclose this if they don't have to, but is this in fact a hard covenant that they will have to disclose to Moody's, and if disclosed, how long will Moody's take to act upon such information??  Tesla will not advertise this, the fan boy banker analysts on the conference calls will NOT asked this, but does Tesla have to make a public disclosure of breach of a rating covenant or just disclose quietly to Moody's and beg no immediate action is taken??Once again, great article, keep up the good work.",
"With regard to M&A, but Tesla only (not a potential suitor), can somebody comment on the Solar City acquisition?  If Solar City / Tesla solar is a shrinking and / or unprofitable business, at what point is Tesla forced to do a write-down (from a GAAP or SEC perspective)?Tesla paid $2.6 billion for Solar City.  While the cash consequences are basically nil today, the GAAP profits consequences are huge.  And could a ""forced"" Solar City write-down completely change the narrative regarding Musk / Tesla (the goose-that-lays-the-go... narrative)?CoverDrive / Montana Skeptic are leaning towards a near $1 billion GAAP loss for 2018 quarter one from Tesla operations (not M&A failures).  How much bigger could a GAAP loss be when the Solar City bailout / business debacle is finally accounted for (written down)?  $1 billion quarterly GAAP loss (for operations) would be a record for Tesla as your article attests.  What will the quarter look like (GAAP) when Tesla writes-down the Solar City bailout?Do companies generally get away with not writing down failed acquisitions like companies generally get away with not writing down failed goodwill?",
"Maybe some good examples (of what could happen to Tesla) are1.  Microsoft's rescue of Nokia.2.  HP's purchase of Autonomy.3.  Google's acquisition of Motorola.We've all heard of the ""falling knife"" phenomenon.  It occurs not just on the individual stock level but on the M&A level too.  It is a risk to bears of Tesla I think.",
"Montana Skeptic:Is there a chance that Musk and Deepak have spent most of the last month looking for a buyer?  This would not be a buyer of Tesla at $300 or above.  It would be a buyer of Tesla below $200 (or well below $200).  There have been rumors of a Chinese suitor.  Tesla has a premium brand name and a large, loyal following (both in the cars and in the stock).  Could a buyer come in and pay a premium to a fallen stock price, just to get the brand name and Musk and whatever future business envisioned?We know no one is considering rescuing SHLD (Sears / Kmart).  Sears and Kmart brands are awful.  SHLD is going to zero, the only question is the timing.  But Tesla could be bought out after a going-concern crisis (a pre-bankruptcy crisis).  The creditors would support such a move (the buyer would presumably have capital and experience in the car business).  The buyer would only have to believe that the brand / business (that they would fix) would be worth more than the (fallen) market cap (e.g. 20 billion or 30 billion).  Since Tesla is worshiped by so many with a market cap of approx $50 billion currently, could it not be worshiped after a big drop in the stock price to get market cap to $20 or $30 billion (by somebody who thinks they can get it to $100 billion with their capital and expertise)?I'm trying to think of a real world example of this having happened in the past.  Recently VZ bought Yahoo, but Yahoo was a tarnished brand.  Harley Davidson has a small, loyal following and is looking for a suitor (for primarily its brand name as its business is not very good).  Others here may be able to come up with better examples.The worst thing that can happen to bears is for a bigger, more capitalized idiot to overpay for a company that is in a desperate situation (headed for bankruptcy without help from the bigger company).  Bank of America bought Countrywide Mortgage and lost a bunch of money on the acquisition (with only $4 billion plus to purchase).  But the Countrywide Mortgage bears lost money too.",
Montana don’t forget Tesla will pick up $500 million in equity this quarter due to a credit to retained earnings for revenue recognition.   Therefore book value won’t decrease by the full $850 million loss.  This will also result in a $500 million decrease to liabilities and the deferred revenue accounts.,

"Who the heck is cover drive? And if he is so prolific in  notes to MS why doesn't he write his own articles? MS you quote him as if he is expert and I see no bio, no identity, zip, nada! So why is he your openly quoted expert?",
"Another stellar article, MS.""So, forget about 300,000, and forget about even 200,000. Tesla will be lucky to hit 150,000.""I've been saying the same thing for 12 months or more.  I said 250,000 would be the most optimistic sales number for all models combined, S, X, and 3, and 150,000 most optimistic for the 3.  Past behavior does sometimes predict future results, contrary to what some bulls think.  Musk has always been way too misleading about future operations. I view the positive operating income and cash flow this year that he has forecast as the same crap.   Predictable and based on past behavior and performance.",
""" outside a mall overnight to reserve a car that retails 50% over the marked price, with delivery in ~3 years.""Not surprised if some of them dont order a Tesla and forgot the 1 K in Tesla accounts.",
The guy actually had to go to the dealership to reserve it? Why can't you do it online? What is it 1980? Maybe it is to try to sway to buy a fossil car?,
Tesla doesn't have the demand for a 2.5K production rate let alone a 5K production rate because there's no such demand for a $55K model 3 variant. So forget about the 2.5K production rate it won't happen. There's no demand for that car at those prices. What are they going to do? Produce those cars and let them sit there? The demand is for the 35K variant which doesn't exist.,
MS you mention in your article that Moody’s might ask Tesla how many reservations they have now.  Can they make Tesla state that?  Also is there a way Moody’s might know or find out but not reveal?Just curious as obviously you know more about bonds and their regulation than I do or care to.Thanks,
Twain on Tesla: “The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.”,
"Thanks for the update MSas always makes for a great reading and also filled with a lot of issues to consider and act upon too.I too believe TSLA will post a horrendous first qtr for 2018The prospect of selling more than 125k Model 3 cars this year is very slim and i would place an upper barrier of 150k Model 3 sold for this year ( i see this as a very optimistic upper barrier currently).The way things look like now and the way TSLA has been excelling in botching execution and performance efforts of production I would not be shocked to see 100-110k Model 3  sold this year.My take of the problem is two fold..1. Execution issues2. Lack of demand at the price point the Model 3 is offered at currently.Since I believe TSLA will desperately try to postpone and delay any sales at 40-35k (due to it leading to MASSIVE further losses) I do not see a way for them to ramp up sales much above that $125k a year - at best!I see a Moody's downgrade in the near offing (not longer than 3-4 months IMO).TSLA's credit is probably a weak CCC by now and given another quarter or two of very large losses it would be a weak CC in 4 months.Thus the Senior HY credit should trade at a yield of at least 8-9% IMO.Re the bear trap theory (and warning) - TSLA has been known to use any and every trick in the book to try to manipulate the stock price.Problem is, their efforts have been less and less effective over the past 9 months. Positive announcements have been less meaningful for the share price and with much shorter shelf life.Thus, I will keep my MO of using the stock swings to trade short term options (with a clearly bearish view).For those who have interest I have been posting some of my trades as close as possible to real time and below is a link to the latest string under your previous CoverDrive projections article https://seekingalpha.c...",
"For example, the agencies are definitely getting data on M-3 reservation numbers, since they publicly stated they would downgrade if reservations fall under 350K, as you note in IIB of the article.  The banksters are likely all over the agency analysts with all these ""but, but, but..."" arguments, and may even be massaging the data.  I hope the agencies have some thick skinned analysts on Tesla, the Junk Bond Issuer.",
"""There's a better chance of me standing on the surface of Mars this year than of Tesla going bankrupt in the same time frame.""Tough statement. :)Anyway, as Muks says, the probability that we are NOT living in a computer simulation is 1 : 50x10^9.",
"Montana, let's agree first --Yes, this quarter will likely be bad financially.  Everyone expects that.Yes, Tesla will announce their best burst rate in their investor letter.Yes, Tesla will raise more money.Now for the fun stuff.There's a better chance of me standing on the surface of Mars this year than of Tesla going bankrupt in the same time frame.This year, as the Model 3 story grows, people will line up to throw money at Tesla just as the head financier of the Little Rascals demonstrated.  http://gph.is/19Vw3DRSo -- if we agree on all of the above, the most telling difference is in the bull/bear view of your Jaguar story.I read --1.  A company that has no idea how to take an online reservation2.  A company that requires you to visit a brick and mortar to fill out paperwork and hand over a credit card.  Is this 1970?3.  A 3rd party dealership that has no communication from corporate as to when or how these cars will be delivered.  Rendering the aforementioned customer's field-trip mostly worthless.This is not dissimilar to buying something online from Best Buy, checking the box ""Will pick up in store"", and then showing up, waiting for 15 minutes to get someone's attention, and waiting another 15 minutes for some other disinterested slacker to fetch your item from the same shelf you could have accessed 30 minutes ago.  This is an utterly embarrassing, dystopian clash of past and future.  Is it any wonder why most brick and mortar are dying?  And why most in Big Auto similarly have no clue?Just this week Tesla quietly released their silky-smooth autopilot update, with no fanfare nor even a single tweet from Musk.  Despite enormous delays and still no FSD features, owners are ecstatic.  How?  Why?Because here's how their competition handles the ONE thing they can update  They charge $139.99 ($20 off) for the privilege of UPDATING YOUR IN-CAR MAPS.  Yes, your smartphone does a better job of navigating, and your in-car maps are static, slow, and on a frightfully small screen, but you can update them once a year.  (Do they still mail you a DVD?)http://bit.ly/2FYqID2This is Best Buy vs. Amazon.  And Jaguar is no different.  They're now Best Buy with an ""online ordering system"", to be picked up in store.So you see, Tesla isn't just Tesla, it's the ""future"", as viewed by its customers and investors.  And, as such, they will be given an enormously long runway for takeoff.  Longer than most can imagine.",
"Moody's and S&P will tell you the ratings are intentionally ""sticky"" and are very rarely changed quickly (under a year or so, though there is no hard and fast rule).  I believe S&P already has them on Outlook Negative, which is one step short of what Moody's calls ""watchlist."" I think Moody's will put them on Watchlist Negative before the actual downgrade, but agree that a downgrade is inevitable given Tesla's piss-poor financial and operational performance since the rating was initially assigned.  At the current low rating levels, the agencies are probably in no great hurry, but the time is definitely coming IMO. I know equity investors sometimes find the rating agencies' slowness frustrating, but they do hold meetings with the CFO, CEO and other key operational  before they change a rating or outlook to give the issuer a chance to address concerns.  And then the ratings go through a committee process where the lead analyst present his/her case for a particular rating, and senior committee members pepper him/her with questions.  Further, I know for a fact that agencies receive nonpublic interim financial and operational data. Oftentimes, though, especially with a dog credit like Tesla, the banksters that the issuer's hire will make the analyst's  life hell in order to prevent a downgrade.",

This means retarding M3 production yet again and again.One plus two equal this:  Elon Musk, i. e. Tesla personified,  has no way to undo his own two years-plus of bungling and neglect of the Model 3, not even with Twitter.  His only choice is to offer more equities.

It would be the same as not disclosing their cash balance, and in fact should be broken out as a separate line item by a truly responsible and transparent corporation.

I expect 22.5% .As of today: March 2018 deliveries in Norway are 649 vs 747 in March 2017.

I can see an announcement of achieving 2500 cars per week total between all 3 models.I can see a model 3 announcement that they have achieved that rate momentarily and blame suppliers or others for it not continuing at that rate.I can see pointing out they sell more EV's than anyone on the planet and that the model 3 is the best selling EV in the world. I can see claiming that the growth story continues because they sold more vehicles than last year ignoring the model by model comparisons.5000 per week as an absolute maximum is a pathetically low rate of automotive manufacturing. It isn't unusual to have 2 10 hour shifts building cars 6 days a week for a high volume product. That works out to 120 hours of production per week and 5000 divided by 120 is a paltry 42 cars per hour. We have run as high as 80 cars per hour at times. We have run more than 120 hours per week when it was necessary too. I don't believe his line was designed to run at anything less than 70 jobs per hour.,

I am no automotive expert but I am guessing that a 40% rework rate for parts has to be catastrophic for margins.If it is true that Tesla can't raise capital by equity then its game over by year-end.  Another attempt to raise $1.5B in debt will panic already nervous bondholders.  This will start a negative feedback loop of equity selling causing further bond selling.,

"Agreed it will be a mess...and that investors won't care.  They'll care about when the III will be in volume enough to measure gross margins and whether Tesla can scale their Op ex.  I think Q3 will be the answer to at least the first - with less than 15% being, a believe, a lethal blow.  But if SGA also increases on an incremental basis more than 2-3K per car, it will also be a blow.  Right now, per Cover's forecast for Q1, the absolute Op ex per car is 33K in Q1 and down to 16K by Q4 - still way too high...but the incremental Op ex per car in his model ends up being 2-3K.     You can imagine Tesla being a going concern if they can scale production at 15% margins and incremental op ex of 2K per car (5% of 40K).  Again - valuation aside here - but at least the bankers could look at this and IMAGINE they'd get their money back.",

“ I’m short Tesla via long dated options” only way to safely play this Idabble in options infrequently ... but this may be worth a review as the bubble has to burst at some point Just my humble opinion,
"Hi Montana, thanks for the article, I appreciate the point of view.What caught my eye above was the 'bear trap' element. TSLA has been both resilient and resourceful in raising capital, but relying as they have on debt is risky. It is puzzling to me that they have not employed what ought to be their cheapest form of capital - equity - to do a raise. Fears of dilution? Perhaps. But I can't think 'more debt' is the answer, even if it were feasible, and I wouldn't think private equity types would be interested until they see better metrics around the M3 ramp. So, how to issue more equity as efficiently as possible? Well, the scenario you lay out above, or something like it, seems plausible. I'm short via a long-dated put bear spread. I'm very patient.Best of luck to all.",
"So the question heading into earnings then becomes - yes, they may hit a delivery record, but at what cost? Keep in mind the record is still _vastly_ under the projections that Tesla has given to investors. Model 3 margins/capital are extremely detrimental to the bottom line. A Moody's downgrade and Fed raise make the debt market impossible to go back to. So equity raise it is. But will the market take this into account when earnings are released?",
"$900 million loss sounds about right, but I agree with the idea that this could be a bear trap. Bursting up to 2000 vehicles in the last week won’t get questioned until the Q1 financial call, if at all, so the stock has a lot of time to come up even if that number is disingenuous.

"What a load of BSJetlines is publicly traded.  Their cash balance as of Sept 2017 was less than C$4mm.  There have been no material transactions indicating that they have raised any new capital since that time.  If there had been, they'd be material and would have to be reported to and filed with the regulator and would be available for everyone to see on SEDAR.com.Other than press releases, there have been no financial filings since they reported their Sept 30 finances at the end of Nov 2017. No capital means they have nowhere near the c$75mm required by the Canadian regulator to show prove they have enough $ for all start up costs and 90 days of operations. Remember that Roots Air started in late March 2001 and was gone 6 weeks later after burning through c$34m.Without cash, Jetlines have no way of leasing the aircraft they require.

Right beneath it was a story how he was trying to use the courts to force some native Hawaiians (because Mr Z respects native peoples so much) to sell their property adjacent to his so he would have no neighbors. How he was constructing a 20 foot wall around the property which was 700 acres (because he believes in an open society) and hiring more armed security and getting permits so they could carry fully automatic weapons to guard his family (because he is a big believer in gun control but not for him).  It appears to me most people are just fine with Mr. Z making an extra couple billion selling data as long as its used by the political party they support as simple as that.  That party being (right now because obama is out of office) not trump or republicans.

"First of all, thanks to the author for the article. He is at least half-right.I held FB before this recent news. I quickly sold it (at a nice profit). I may buy it back when the dust settles. I am not a Facebook user.I would make 3 points:- I absolutely agree with the author that this does not constitute a ""data breach."" Language like that only obscures the real issue.- Facebook's response has been abysmally weak. By concentrating on  defending itself against the charge of a ""data breach,"" it has made the debate about that instead of addressing the real issues. These concern FB's use of user data, some of which is  highly personal. What data does it sell? To whom does it sell it? Does it do due diligence on these companies? Does it do due diligence on how they will use the data? Does it have adequate measures in place to ensure that data is deleted after a certain period or when that is a contractual requirement? Facebook's measures in these respects may well be excellent, or not, but public clarity seems to be lacking.- The apparent use of Facebook data in the 2016 US campaign - and in the UK Brexit vote - has introduced a political element into the news. Whether or not such use is proper, regulatory and legislative investigations in the US, the UK and the EU will probably ensure that the current publicity will not disappear quickly. Combined with FB's earlier announcement regarding changing their content model, this may keep the share price stagnant for some time.",
"Excellent article Joe. At today's price, i can't view this as anythiing but a great buying opportunity. So many of these headline stories tied to politics have a half life shorter than that of francium. Nothing fundamentally wrong with Facebook other than a deplorable contractor. Oops.",
"Thanks for the article Joe. Many of the points that you have raised seem reasonable, but of course, a lot of uncertainty remains regarding various issues. Here are a few additional points which further support the feeling that what we see in the media (and the market) is a disproportional hysteria:1. Does anyone know how many of the said 50 millions users were/are American citizens? This number is not clear to me at all and I won't be surprised if many of them were/are actually not American citizens (it is well known that a lot of facebook users have facebook friends from abroad). Moreover, among the users who are/were American citizens, how many were old enough to vote in the 2016 elections? Again, this is not at all clear, but it won't be surprising to know that this number is significantly less than 50M (since there are many young people who use facebook). 2. How aggressively have the said 50M users been targeted? It is not unlikely that many of them have just received a small amount of insignificant ads. And even if this was not the case, still, how many people do take seriously ads related to elections (any elections, everywhere)? Not many, as far as I know. 3. One of the most distorted issues here, at least in my opinion, is actually related to the mainstream media and not to facebook. Consider for instance the Guardian (the media outlet which reported this affair): this is a big British media outlet, which also has an American edition, and has been very biased and obsessive against Trump almost since Trump joined the election race in the middle of 2015 and until this very day. So, on the one hand, the Guardian and many others have highly criticized the fact that a foreign entity (Cambridge Analytica) was somehow (legally, it seems) involved in the 2016 American elections, and yet, them and many others consider as legitimate the fact that a powerful foreign entity (the Guardian) will interfere, in a very aggressive manner, in the American elections and in the American politics. Moreover, this intervene has been done by a media outlet which, at least if we regard it in the eyes of classical journalism, is expected to be unbiased (but obviously this is not true for many years neither regarding the the Guardian, nor regarding the majority of  media outlets around the world). This issue seems to me not less severe than the Cambridge Analytica affair, no matter if one supports Trump or not supports him.",

There is a lot of uncertainty about how these changes will affect their revenue. Rightly so - what other business can so fundamentally change their  business behind the scenes overnight?I agree that it's likely FB will weather these storms and surprise, as usual, with strong profits during next QR. But I'm out for now - the negative press in this case is a lot deeper and more fundamental to the business model than the other examples cited. And as a growth stock, FB has a lot farther to oitebtially fall before things improve.",

"Joe, first let me say that you are 100% correct in your thoughts about FB and the misuse of the data by CA.  I'm a software developer, and have created FB apps and can vouch everything you say.  The problem is simply that this is now truly a political issue only. Correct there was no data breach of involentary information.  This was simply surface graph info merge with some CA data.

This is a ""tempest in a teapot"" due to severe overreaction due to the political factor.Thankfully the market will eventually see that there will be no mass deletions of individual accounts, no government fines or added regulatory restrictions especially in the Republican led executive and congressional government we are in right now.I  have seen these ""quizzes"" used before by both parties, to gain somewhat personal information on voter sentiment. As I have said before in my previous posts, and confirmed by you in this piece, there were no addresses, no credit card numbers, no passwords, no social security numbers breached. As a matter of fact, there wasn't a breach like the hacks of the past like Home Depot, Target etc.So, as a long FB share holder, I agree that this will blow over, and I think buying this dip is going to be very profitable.I agree that Cambridge Analytica has broken the rules by not destroying the data and transferring the data.",

"This is all about the legacy media trying to discredit FB in order to stop the ad revenue bleeding, not to mention the loss of mind control over the population.  They know exactly what they are doing, Ignoring the facts and generating their own.  The legacy media magnates (aka the 1%) see their influence disappearing and they believe now is their opportunity to attack.  What they fail to understand is that chance disappeared years ago.  The narrative should change to question exactly what data does the legacy media collect and how do they use it.Think browser cookies!",

"Thanks for the reasonable voices during a time of political-induced panic. I also noted that the MSM have been unusually harsh toward FB during this event, probably also a political thing.",
"Where was this backlash when Obama used the same tactics that Cambridge did to win 2012? This is simply political perspective that legitimately accessed data helped Trump and that's unacceptable to a media population that is biased left. There is no difference between Cambridge's use and Obama's, except the party of the winner of the election. The fact that the same tactics can be used to benefit conservatives could result in enough political noise to force a change in the data that is accessed, thus the FB business model.  I haven't heard of any major advertisers running for the doors yet.",
I guse FB is innocent because EFX ANTM HD and TGT did it too. data is data,
"This is the best article I've read on the topic so far.  This Cambridge Analytica scandal is just the latest manifestation of the ongoing search for someone to blame for the 2016 election results.  If you've paid attention to the political discussion then you've noticed that the target has moved from one scapegoat to the next and Facebook is currently the latest target.Regarding the investment impact of this scandal, if United Airlines can beat a passenger and drag him off a plane and still pack flights a year later, then I'm pretty sure Facebook will be forgiven by both users and advertisers for any perceived violation of user privacy.  This CA scandal will be forgotten in 6 months.",
FB 100 a good buy,

"Excellent and balanced commentary.   This is contrast to the hysteria we have heard from others of late.  For example Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of Yale yesterday called FB a ""monster"".  Another commentator called for the break-up of the company.What has happened here (use of targeted data) has been going on for many years, by many, many organizations.  FB is just better at targetting.",

"""It's hard to see advertising revenue affected"" - just curious, how do you know total FB revenue will not be impacted??Consider Cambridge Analytica - presumably, it wants to know FB user details, detailed preferences, likes, etc. because of its marketing value, even though this is a breach of privacy ... surely this must have follow on benefits in monetary terms to FB isn't it?Now, I agree there are a lot of people who might get rubbed by FB in the wrong way, so there is strong incentives ... if that type of revenue is eventually shut down, wouldn't FB total revenue be adversely impacted?Hence, I am curious to know how you know there is no adverse impact to FB future revenues.Also, what if the outcome of regulatory investigations is higher standards of compliance costs?  What if they demand that every future apps must meet certain more stringent requirements? Couldn't this have some adverse impact also to both increased costs and lesser revenues?Sounds to me, the future FB business model might be slower than before - trouble is so many things are uncertain at this juncture, but probably actual damage will likely to be much smaller than a lot of the fears but to say no impact is also not quite correct I feel ...",

If for some reason the iPhone falls out of favor amongst consumers, the stock will plummet. Now, it’s clear that Apple is slowly starting to shed the skin of the “one trick” pony label, but until the “other products” category and “services” portion of the company become 50% or more of sales, Apple will never get a PE valuation higher than 20.   The market views Apple as just to risky, with one product accounting for 65% of sales. If Apple can keep up the trajectory of these other categories, than yes, I truly believe we can get a valuation in the mid twenties in the next couple of years.",

"ccnc3: If I were to stay with FTR long term, my objective would be the same as yours. My stock portfolio involves 7 high dividend stocks from four different sectors. Dollar cost averaging/drip works well. FTR will not be that stock in 3 months. However, It is tempting to take 1 more bite of the apple before that last huge dividend and that might still become a reality especially if FTRPR dips to around $10.50. Good luck to all of us.",
Is the FTRPR dividend still being paid?,
"Ya so even the bond experts say bk will have to wait till 2021. In the mean time revenue goes flat co. becomes profitable, 4 bill more in cap ex and at least 1.3 bill in debt paid off. It will not take much of an improvement in margin or revenue in order for $FTR to run the table on the debt. $FTR can buy the debt below par. too!",
Wow that was a very good exchange between fliper and Gridbird  Thank u.,
"Wow, what a fascinating exchange of ideas from Gridbird and fliper2058, I have a question about FTRPR for any of you experts out there. Has there ever been another convertible preferred that converted into the common where they were both severely distressed like FTRPR and FTR? This seems to be a unique situation especially with the huge preferred dividend.",
"fliper, my main worry is be aware of what is in an actual trust prospectus. Im not sure you were familiar with this. I have done some research on trust preferreds and some things can go very wrong (to detriment of trust holder, not brokerage or trustee). Always be mindful of what your buying when getting trust issues. I would check to be doubly sure about what bond value you would get in your earlier scenerio. I havent checked details as I decided not to buy a long time ago, but that area would be ripe for a certificate holding screwing too if assumption was wrong or wasnt explicitly laid out in prospectus.",
"flipper: My take on your 2 posts above is:1. The unsecured bonds are as distressed as the stock due to different factors.2. Due to the pressure on bonds new money into bonds has less down side and greater upside the same as new money (with good timing) into FTRPR has the same factors vs old money in FTRPR or in the bonds. 3. Using the 7 year term indicates your belief (hope) that the 2022 wall will be eliminated or moved back and that the 2025 wall is the next real problem.4. New money into FTR bonds needs to factor the cost of the bond, the interest rate, and not so much the term of the bond as all unsecured bonds end up in the same boat in BK regardless of maturity date.5. The farther out bonds have a greater potential recovery (in rise of price not in BK) %, the shorter bonds have a greater potential of being redeemed at par with less potential (risk?) % increase. All of the unsecured bonds in BK have the same recovery in BK what ever that turns out to be.6. Whatever bond used for a hedge against FTR should be chosen to attempt to receive at least 60% return of initial investment in the next 5-7 years, if possible.7. If the 60% return is compromised one needs to add to the position at a lower bond cost, if possible, to return to that level. As has been pointed out on SA before a position in FTR bonds can be used to hedge a position in FTR/FTRPR. Dr Owl likes PIY for that hedge. Looking at PIY given the last close at $17.20/$25 = 68.8%. For the same hedge a bond with a price of less than $68.80 with the same or more interest rate gives the same hedge as PIY currently, given a 5-7 year time frame, regardless of the term. Correct? I understand that PIY gives $29+ protection in BK, just trying to do apples to apples. If the above is correct I may have to become a bond guy whether I want to or not. Fidelity has a limited selection of FTR bonds so that doesn't help.Thanks for your time and information.",
Owl says 75 mill profit 2018 or .95 a share didn't you read the article. The analyst do not work for me they work for some one else. The fact is consensus was off  over .50 last quarter Owl was right only off a few pennies. Who should I believe for 2018! I'm not an analyst but I can read and can add if you take Q4 -.59 and add .60 common div savings you get .01 Q1. Now I know that Q1 is a weaker quarter for $FTR so I may be wrong but that will be closer than -.97 Q1 consensus. Lets figure this another way you take ave beat last two quarters of .33 subtract that from consensus plus the savings from common div you get .-97 - .33 - .60 = -.04 This would be my prediction Q1 .01 to -.04 lets see who's closer the wall street guys or the retail guy!,
i cant say i am long FTR because i want to be at this point. LONG FTR.,
"Some of the really long unsecured bonds now trade at $50. This really is not ""debt"" anymore but quasi-equity. At a 7% coupon at $490, is collecting 14.28% a year. In 7 years you have collected enough coupon to give you a zero initial cost ($49/$7=7). The bonds are now starting to price in a potential very low recovery in the future. The additional $1.6b secured bonds now moves the expected recovery to the unsecureds to extremely low is what the market is saying......",

"True value of $FTR will be reflected in the stock when the shorts leave. In order for the shorts to leave debt needs to go down or the retail investor needs to come back. When I say sorry bk crowd you wil have to wait I am talking to the wall street guys and so are you. But what will bring the retail guys back is earnings. The retail guy looks at the chart and see's value reads the ""drive by news articles then looks at the negative earnings and says ya bk it's true. But if the retail guy looks at the earnings and it is .05 then 'this is a turn around story"" Whats you Q1 number? Consensus -.97 is wrong. The wall street guy have yet to add in the common div savings .60 per quarter. If you take Q4 -.59 and add div saving you get Q1 .01. If you added the ave beat last 2 quarters of .33 or the improving earnings over the last 3 quarters of .20 then you start to realize this co. is on its way to being profitable. Yet still the analyst still show losses through 2021. Management would want nothing more than to change the bk story and bring the retail guy back. Putting some green on the board would change it from a bk story to a ""turn around story""! That would be the catalyst to move the stock higher and we known that will happen this yr. 491mill debt due 10/1/18 So for right now earnings will be the more important driver of stock price in the short term.

True cash flow pays down debt. But most people will not buy a co. that's does not make money. As far as the bk crowd goes well of course there going bk after all they are not making money.That was the reason I passed on $ELNK when trading in the $3 dollar range. Then ay went up to $7 and why were they trading at $7 because the were paying down debt but still losing money. So I shorted them. Made a little money too much momentum and not enough time or guts to follow though on the trade. $ELNK went to $9 then back to $5 I believe was bought out by $WIN. Point being. If you have a good story and enough money you can push a stock to were you want it to go. Shorts will have to leave in order to find out true value of $FTR,
Love your analysis and have enjoyed reading your points. Hoping you are right long term. My average is 10.2 With a smidge of wiggle room to lower it. Definitely crossing my fingers. I'll have to take a pretty decent loss if things don't turn around in  the next few quarters.,

"I am in complete agreement with Owl's contributions and analysis for this company. Anyone who criticizes him for having lost money is being very unfair at best. Although I have not been able to read all his articles and definitely not the one when the price for FTPPR was $75. I think at the time he would have had one quarters results after the VZ acquisition and going by the company's track record of how well they integrate newly acquired businesses with their own, you cannot blame him. He would not have have known that the integration of the VZ asset would prove to be difficult one for the company.Yes the company lost customers and the revenues di not match up to their pre acquisition expectations. However, the good thing about this company is they have a grip on their CAGR.With declining revenues they have managed to reduce the CAGR and also the Capex. Most companies fail because they are not quick to contain costs  when revenues are declining.Unfortunately, all telcos' are experiencing such perennial declines and so do most all companies one time or another. However, FTR being a rural service provider would have created a new market of 775,000 potential customers by 2020 in rural USA. This could be the saviour for the company and now having removed the debt wall can also capitalize on their FIOS assets. In a few Qtrs' the story will reveal itself.",
"Owl,Thanks for the sharing your pile of work you have prepared. Lots of good numbers and rational behind your assumptions. If only a fraction of SA contributors would put in the effort you do we'd all be a lot smarter.I can't say I will agree or disagree, your level of knowledge is far ahead of me. Management has answered to the things I was most upset about in a matter of a month, cut the dividend and do a Distressed Debt Exchange. As a credit buyer this is what needed to obviously happen if their goal was not to file.As bizarre as it seems, ""tossing the stock into the wind"" and buckling down on debt means to me they ARE serious about staying out of court. Not just talking about how great things will be.As much as I'd like to see lots of long term bonds taking out cheap, I don't see it at this point yet. Do you know their secured capacity left after the sale of the 2nd lien? When you buy a 2040 bond it will reduce the interest payment and reduce the EV of the firm, good stuff, but the cash is gone forever. So attacking near term debt that could potentially be devastating is the right move for now. I do feel debt for equity exchanges (cashless) make sense for long debt removal. I assume they are going to want a quarter where a BIG debt removal number hits the balance sheet for a ""wow"" effect. This one could be it. Of course if they use more secured debt the unsecured will continue weak, a catch 22 when you are trying to gain access back INTO that traditional financing arm.",

"You say the co. will be profitable in 2018. Nobody believes you! Except for me. You were right on your Q4 earnings call of around -.55 consensus was -1.06.

What is your 2018 Q1 number? Right now consensus is -.97. I think co. can do .05 management needs to change the story, being profitable is one way to do that. Total debt with subsidiaries from Dec 2016 to Dec 2017 is down 310 mill. The number the co. has to hit for debt reduction is 500 mill. yr. with the 250 mill. div savings this is not a problem. 750 mill would be better, but a 250 mill cushion every yr. gives co. flexibility to make open market purchases or just add to cash.",

"Really two steps need to happen before they can seriously think about buying the deeply discounted debt. First step was the $1.6B 2026 funding the buy back of 2020/2021 debt - dropping the maturity values to very manageable $227M in 2020 and $319M in 2021. The next step is paying off the 10/2018 $582M maturity and 3/2019 $434M maturity (FINRA Bond info). Until the March 2019 is paid off, they really cannot pursue other purchases so I suspect we are a full year away from FTR buying any heavily discounted debt.Pretty tall order to knock out $1 billion maturing in the next 12 months - I suspect that is closer to $900M now as the 4Q buy downs are probably not included in the FINRA data. With $360M cash and the preferred conversion juicing FCF ability in June - they look to have this in order without a ton of room for error.",
"When the dividend was eliminated I went away. FTR has some compelling positives but whether or not they can stabilize remains to be seen. What I have come to increasingly realize is financials matter little, it is the hostility of the banks and financial markets. One need only to read the earnings call transcripts to witness their level of hostility. With more core cutting(excellent articles in USA Today-3/21/18), FTR share values could be compelling. Yet, there are few, if any, commercial enterprises that can function without sources of refinancing. That is especially true with the likes of AT&T, VZ which have enormous debt, their dividend, capex numbers are far greater in proportion to cash flow than FTR.

"Hi Owl,I don't think you can assume cost reductions leading to an improvement in EBITDA anymore.  If that were true, we should have seen an improvement in EBITDA margin from previous cost reductions.  We did not, so I would throw away any ""cost reduction"" benefit and instead go with an assumption that EBITDA remains 38.5%.Regarding capital allocation, I agree articulation of a strategy would be very helpful for investors.  However, spending cash on capex is a risky endeavor, paying off debt is not.  Furthermore, I assume management can at least to some extent focus on market buybacks of debt at a discount rather than paying off at par the average debt.  So the reality is capex expenditures need at least a 16% expected return to be justified in my mind (even there I feel I am being generous).Fiber assets have sold in the market for 5-7% yields (see Uniti purchases of fiber assets).  Selling a couple billion of their fiber assets, or doing a sale leaseback at those yields, and using the resulting cash to buyback discounted debt would go a long way to getting the snowball moving.  Managements lack of debt payoff to date is VERY disappointing.Disclosure - 5% allocation to Frontier: 0.8% in FTRPR, 4.2% to 2022 and 2023 bonds",

"Another thought about Spotify on Day 1.  Since Spotify is bypassing the underwriting syndicate, does anyone think that there will be some well-heeled companies that have lots of prior experience taking companies public who will feel threatened by Spotify?  They could lose out on future fees if this offering does well and is a template followed by others.  Those companies could  potentially decide to short a bunch of shares to try and suppress the price.  Would they be able to do this on Day 1 or would they have to wait til settlement to be able to locate shares?",
"I'm confused about something and that is the remark in the article above that Spotify doesn't have a wide moat.  They do have first mover advantage.  In my case, I currently have 129 Playlists with a total of over 1,000 songs on them.  I spent dozens of hours putting this all together.  I can't imagine what Apple could do to entice me to start all over with them, even though I am a happy iPhone user.  I am very happy with Spotify.  Why should I (or other users) want to switch?  For someone starting from scratch, maybe they'd consider Apple, but I'm happy with what I've got and am recommending it to a bunch of my friends as well.I wonder which of these songs I will play after the first day of trading:We are the Champions. (in the event of a good direct public offering)Another One Bites the Dust (bad first day)",
"Thanks for the article, just wanted to point out a few things that were coming to mind as I was reading through:- The article argues that Spotify should be more like the music social network; imo, that's exactly what spotify is already. Besides browsing artist pages, people have created millions of playlists that others can listen to.- further to above point, I agree with previous comment that selection isn't everything. Spotify is becoming also a huge content curator; they are doing a ton of AI to get you to listen to what they think you may like based on your historical listening activities. The 'Weekly Discover' and 'Daily Mix' playlists are examples of that. Apple has been doing it before with Genius on Itunes but I don't remember using it as much as the Spotify feature, because it's honestly pretty, pretty, pretty good. This capacity, combined with a strong brand, can constitute a competitive moat. It's not if but when Apple will become market leader anyways, but that's because Apple is Apple. Whatever Apple does, they'll end up in the top players of a market if they're willing to spend enough money on the matter given their huge user base. Being a solid number 2 in a growing market is not necessarily the end of the world, so I think Spotify will be fine. Besides, if things heat up they can constitute a good M&A target.- Lastly, the volatility and pricing points, which are the ones I disagree the most with. Having some background in capital markets and now as an investor, I actually feel much more comfortable taking part in Spotify's direct listing (if I do, which I may) than an IPO. All the reasons given by the author outlining why an IPO is safer are all the reasons why an IPO is one of the most artificial and restricted phenomenons in finance. Price set by banks and offered to only a few select investors, trading desks pumping the stock up to get a pop on the first day (and let retail investors worry about buying an overpriced stock), current holders not able to sell for months, etc. Granted, what Spotify is about to do is likely going to be more volatile (whether up or down); but volatility in that context may also present an opportunity for the astute investor who exercises caution buying into the stock (basically not buying all at once if things are moving up and down). In fact, I'd argue that Spotify's direct listing may end up being a landmark case of market democracy. Finally a stock listing that everyone can get from the beginning, with no investor getting preferential treatment, no artificial buying and selling, etc. If Spotify's listing is successful (and I believe it may, over a 6 month horizon), other companies will surely follow and shortcut the IPO circuit, assuming they don't need the cash.Again, thanks for the article, it's always helpful to read someone's else analysis to further one's own. If I may just critique one point in particular, I found the comparison with Pandora quite misleading, even if acknowledged. I know that Pandora is a competitor (and I haven't looked at their financials), but the fact they have a $1bn market cap. is irrelevant to discuss Spotify's valuation. Spotify's valuation, if discussed, would require a dcf analysis or maybe a multiple analysis -- comparing market capitalizations between companies doesn't offer much of an insight re: cheap vs. expensive.",
"Good article, I am a fan of Spotify and think the product is very sticky and very global with huge potential.  I would push back on your comment, that song selection is the driver and that Spotify having 30 million songs is an issue vs Apple having 40 million.  Other than one album by Beyoncé and a Weather Report album from the 1970s, I have noticed very little they do not have.  Likely Classical and Jazz they are weaker, but they have 30 million songs and for the vast, vast majority of potential users they are completely satisfied or amazed at the selection.",

Spencer; thoughts on the $41.50 offering price? Seems higher than others may have expected especially in consideration of recent price action.,
"There was definitely some sort of shenanigans leading up to these results however strategically it does make a lot of sense to dilute on this news, it really does put the company in a much stronger negotiating position for either partnering or buyout, or worst case if Arena Mngmt feel BP are undervaluing the co. they are well able to go it alone.This buys plenty of options.",
This had darn well be the LAST time they dilute - $500M in cash is more than enough to get both drugs through FDA approval process unless management spends money like it's going out of style.,
Seems like last weeks price drop was in anticipation of the dilution. Up in pre market.,
"New Arena management has now doubled the number of shares since they took over.  Do they really need $500MM+ in cash?  Will they put that money to good use, manage it well, or squander it?  The long time shareholders who have held this miserable stock through the worst leadership in biotech under Jack Leif were hoping that new management would turn their cards over (cards they had nothing to do with discovering and only recently developing) and find a buyer at the best possible stock price. Other than the 3 dilutions, new management has done a good job, for which they are being well compensated.  They had plenty of cash for the next year + and could have let the stock price run before selling shares.  By telling the market they were ""going alone"", institutions, hedge funds got a free run at selling or shorting the stock.  It's a no-lose proposition; if the data are weak, they win.  If the data are strong, they take the new, cheap shares, thanks to dilution and cover their sales, or shorts.  Arena execs need to be more Street savvy and stop giving all the gains to the institutions.  The long term shareholders take substantial risk and are getting NO REWARD.  Who wants to own stock in a company that dilutes every achievement away?  Amit and the BOD need to consider all options to maximize the ""SHARE PRICE"".  That's what they are being paid for, not for rebuilding Jack Leif's failed kingdom and diluting shareholders in half.  Make some BD calls, JNJ, AMGN, Novartis, Abbvie and others should be interested in owning E.  Many companies would be interested in owning R and 371's value is soon to be determined.  R and E each appear to be superior to similar drugs for which large bio-pharmas paid $5-7BB. This is more than a small company like Arena successfully manage.  They need a strong, experienced clinical team and a powerhouse marketing and sales team to maximize the potential of these compounds. Execs should carefully and fully consider all options and start focusing on the stock price, not their bank account and long term employment.  IMO of course.",

"Chris - First I would like to say great article. Very well written. I reread both the LITE and IIVI transcripts and it appears both companies get about a third of their revenue from telecom and data centers. More now for LITE since its announced acquisition of OCLR. I previously said it looks like LITE, IIVI and FNSR are being under priced relative to growth potential in 3D sensing. Yes I think each company has significant exposure to the data center/ telecom side of the business but this slowdown is being more than compensated for by 3D. I think part of the problem is that these companies (especially IIVI and FNSR) keep their numbers so close to the vest. On the IIVI call analysts were even trying to get growth  (beyond the next quarter) from planned optical capex expenditures and this is what the CFO said:""Let me just address the second question first. First of all, I sometimes remind people of this that for the optical communications business in 2013, actually 2016. We expanded the business 35% on those three major product lines and never said a word about it.""I think thats the problem with these stocks, its like a puzzle and you the investor are missing half the pieces. The FNSR call was even worse. On a yahoo message board I saw a comment to the effect of ""If Tesla was valued Iike LITE or IIVI it would be a dollar a share.""  Unlike Tesla where investors see millions and millions of Model 3's (but the day of reckoning  on production will soon come), the market wants to see actual growth before they give LITE, IIVI and especially FNSR the benefit of the doubt. Its kind of frustrating reading these transcripts to see the dance being played between management and analysts to try to get some information for the time beyond the next quarter. I understand there are competitive and regulatory reasons for not disclosing more but it makes it hard for the market to try and discern when for instance will the slow down in telecom and data center finally turn and start to pick up. Are china orders going to come back or not?? How fast will the 3D business ramp?? I think these are all questions holding these stocks back and if they were valued like Tesla (instead of tesla being valued like them)  each would have a zero behind their respective stock prices today. Unlike tesla the market wants to see actual growth in current revenue versus assuming it will just happen. I think it will happen and LITE and IIVI are actually cheap now on any pull back. FNSR is being valued as if sherman wont happen. If sherman starts to pull any meaningful revenue and it starts to really ramp up, I think FNSR is an easy double from here. On the other hand if there is any hiccup, the stock will be punished. I can only say this is what its like when you get in on the early innings of a new technology like 3D sensing. Its a roller coaster ride combination with bumper cars (I am dating myself now).",
"Good article!I am already a LITE bull, heavily invested. Besides that the general trend in fiberoptics looks pretty OK for LITE and OCLR, I think the market is underestimating 3D sensing, and it looks as LITE is superior at revving up capacity there fast.The only other companies that can deliver the complete optical module for 3D sensing are FNSR and IIVI, and neither of them sounded upbeat on their last calls. This is difficult stuff.FNSR said that they may asymptotically approach 100MUSD/q capacity a few quarters after the Sherman factory is up and running, meaning sometime 2019. Lite was shipping 200MUSD already in the dec-17 quarter and are talking about increasing their capacity significantly. Apple watchers keep saying that all iPhone will have 3D sensing on all phones in their September release. That means somewhere between 500M-1BUSD of VCSEL arrays only for AAPL in CH218. And Android will pick up soon. Not surprising the LITE management were so bullish on their CCs.Obviously LITEs non-vertically integrated manufacturing model works much better than the competition.Adding OCLR to the pie seems good, many synergies, and also an excellent company at execution and development. Also less dependence on one customer.I think LITE will deliver huge upside surprises later this year, and believe the stock is bound to cross the 100 line this summer (northern hemisphere!).",

"They approach the market in two very different ways.

There stores are usually free standing.  They are more rural where they are the alternative to driving for an hour to a Walmart or major grocery store. They are now testing smaller inner city locations which could be a great new growth runway for them. Their customer is more lower income than the Dollar Tree customer. Family Dollar (which Dollar Tree bought a couple of years ago) was more similar to a Dollar General in location, market strategy, and customer demographics. I suspect they are struggling a bit to find their core customer with the two very different formats and customer demographics, which is why I invested with DG (back 2 years ago), as well as for the dividend.Almost bought some DLTR after the sell off last month but just missed my limit, and it has risen far beyond that point.

In an era of higher employee scarcity and cost, this is a huge advantage.Secondly,  DLTR's acquisition of the under-performing Family Dollar stores can skew comparisons in the short term.

Apple(AAPL) shares are up 24% over the past 12 months, while Fitbit(FIT) shares have dropped 8.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , of which Apple(AAPL) is a component, is up 18%, compared with a 14% gain for the S&P 500 over 12 months.",

"Review: The new Fitbit Versa is better at sports than smartsMARKETWATCH 8:00 AM ET 3/26/2018Symbol	Last	Price ChangeFIT	4.91down	-0.03 (-0.61%)QUOTES AS OF 11:52:07 AM ET 03/26/2018Communication tasks are frustrating on the Versa smartwatch, but the fitness features work well for a reasonable priceAs a fallen Apple Watch user, I've been in search of a wearable I would truly love using. The Fitbit Versa isn't that, though it's a suitable smartwatch for anyone mainly looking for a health tracker.There are a number of things to like about the Fitbit Versa, which I've been reviewing for the past few days. Its sleek, ""squircular"" shape is a welcome departure from the boxy designs of years past. Fitbit Inc.(FIT) continues to do health better than the rest, and the Versa's on-device, animated workouts are a nice touch. At $199.95, the Versa is immediately more reasonable (https://on.mktw.net/2u...- expand-user-base-2018-... than the $299.95 Fitbit Ionic, without sacrificing much, and you still get more than four days of battery life.Still, the watch has its frustrating elements, especially when it comes to traditional ""smart"" capabilities. Though the Versa looks like an Apple Watch, it doesn't play so nicely with Apple products. iPhone users can receive texts on the device but not send replies, which is more frustrating than not seeing these incoming messages at all. Fitbit(FIT) says that Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) closed ecosystem prevents iPhone owners from sending messages on these devices, though the company is looking at potential workarounds.The Versa would seem to be a better bet for users of phones running Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) (GOOGL) Android software, who have the ability to send quick responses from a preset list, though I wasn't able to test out this feature as an iPhone user. Neither iPhone nor Android owners can send or receive emails on the Versa, which also lacks cellular connectivity. There aren't many times I urgently feel the need to text from my wrist and can't get to my phone, but during those couple instances a week when I do have that urge, I'm disappointed.On the plus side, you get more than four days of battery life on the Versa in return for being Bluetooth-only; I sometimes couldn't get a full day of battery life out of my cellular-connected Apple Watch.In today's smartphone ecosystem, I've come to take apps for granted, a luxury I don't have with the Versa. Fitbit(FIT) has been steadily boosting its app offerings since the Ionic's debut last fall, but it still feels like there aren't enough. Wearables in general are best for things you just need to glance at, but you're out of luck if you want to, say, view your fantasy-team progress on the Versa. Other apps, while neat, don't totally work on a smartwatch screen. A tennis app created by Fitbit's(FIT) Labs division, for example, did a great job at tracking forehands and backhands, but it wanted me to input who won each point, something that's cumbersome to do in the middle of a match.Fitbit (FIT) says it has more than 550 apps and clock faces, though many of the clock faces looked somewhat amateurish.Health and fitness is where Fitbit(FIT) excels, and that was showcased with the Versa. I enjoyed how the Versa interacts with Fitbit(FIT) Coach, a subscription product that provides on-device workouts. In the cold weather, I liked being able to do a variety of new exercises without having to leave the house or contort myself to see my phone in the middle of stretching.The Versa has a few free video workouts built in, but the $39.99 annual subscription gives a host more, for various levels of difficulty. There's also a ""dynamic"" workout customized to my abilities, based on how I rated a bunch of exercises I tried.Compared with Fitbit's(FIT) Ionic smartwatch, the Versa is a better bet for anyone who's not a die-hard outdoor runner. You save $100 by forgoing GPS, and you end up getting a much more stylish watch. I tried out a rose gold model with a peach sport strap that Fitbit(FIT) said was a play on the ""millennial pink"" trend. Fitbit(FIT) also makes black and silver models.In terms of appearance, the Versa is the watch Fitbit(FIT) should've made years ago. Onlookers remark that it looks like an Apple Watch, but that's OK, because Apple's look largely works. The Versa's design is less sporty and better for everyday wearing. In addition to sporting the peach sport band, I also tried out a white sport band and a black metal mesh band. The latter was light and stylish, though admittedly not the best match for a rose gold face. I'd imagine it sits better with the more neutral models.Swapping out bands is quite the challenge if you're not familiar with pin systems--or perhaps even if you are. It look multiple Dow Jones staffers about 10 minutes of fiddling with the straps to figure out how to change them. A tip: Slant the strap as you adjust the pins.Fitbit (FIT) intends for the Versa (https://on.mktw.net/2G...- after-ionic-disappoint... to be its first mass-appeal smartwatch (https://on.mktw.net/2u...- hopes-new-smartwatch-w... and it offered enough to potentially make it worth trading up from a simple fitness band. The ability to listen to music through Bluetooth headphones, which is not the smoothest thing to set up, as well as the benefit of apps and workouts on your wrist definitely make the Versa more useful and fun than a standard tracker.For iPhone users who are mainly looking for a smart device that handles communications, it's worth paying up for an Apple Watch. Even the older Series 1 model, starting at $249, lets you send texts and emails via voice and touch commands. But if health and fitness are your main concerns, the Versa is the Fitbit(FIT) smartwatch to choose.Fitbit (FIT) shares are down 8.4% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 has gained 10%.-Emily Bary; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 03-26-180900ET Copyright (c) 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.<<>>Sounds like the Versa is more an expensive glorified fitness tracker than an actual smart watch.",

"@Iky & @HaveFaith, I share your sentiments re: digital healthcare, and the future value of nexgen wearable technology (I'm also long FIT with a $4.44 basis--I sell calls and puts pretty actively on this name). My main concern is that FIT will not end up being the leader, or even a meaningful player in the space.  Their last several iterations of 'innovation' have been greatly lacking.  They just released a smart watch in 2017, a full two years after the apple watch came out, which itself was already several years behind the Garmins and Pebbles of the world. All that to say...I'm nervous (hence my frequent call-writing on this name).  I want FIT to succeed, and I definitely think this space (healthcare/wearables) is ripe for innovation.  I would much prefer FIT to be the leader in this space since it is a pure-play on wearables as opposed to an AAPL or GOOGL (who, in reality, are likely to be the eventual dominant players).  Unfortunately, they've just shown nothing in product development, vision, and most importantly management leadership/vision.  Ironically, my biggest position is short TSLA and yet what FIT needs is someone like an Elon Musk visionary-type driving this company forward.  There is an amazing narrative and world of possibility in this space that we need to be dreaming about and chasing.  It really feels like this management team was a one-hit wonder, somewhat enamored with their own success, and has no idea what to do next.",

"@Iky. I am with you with regarding Digital health trends. I am in forefront of Blockchain initiatives. I see digital health as one of the major emerging topics in the industry. Fitbit doesn’t know yet but Fitbit devices/IOT and Blockchain are set up as a perfect storm scenario. Perhaps Samsung or Amazon or Google are seeing this. Once they see this and how Fitbit is perfectly set up to capitalize on this emerging theme, $1.2B valuations is too CHEAP. In this space right now, Fitbit is the only player who can capitalize on this. My estimate is at least $12B.",
"This is a very safe article to write.  Yes, we know FitBit is not a good investment as a consumer product company.  A more meaningful conversation is around digital health, cost of healthcare, quality of life, and etc...  The 20th century problems were basic need and communication.  We are overly saturated with basic need such that we are fat, dumb and happy, hence the obesity epidemic, and hence the opportunity.  Telecommunication is saturated with phones services, internet services, and on demand solutions like video, data, etc..., hence the means to integrate a solution.  The next market (problem) is healthcare.  Healthcare business is traditional and ineffective and one might even say inefficient.  It will be disrupted by technologist.  FitBit is working on their platform/core technology to do this.I'm long FitBit not as a wearable but as a digital healthcare startup.  If you think of FitBit as a digital healthcare company with a positive free cash flow from wearable to support their digital health innovation, FitBit becomes much more compelling.",

Rumors are that the direction of the combined company is disjoint and there is resentment  by BHI employees relative to high handed GE management attitude. Don’t know if these rumors are real or whether they are coming from a small group of disaffected individuals. Since the oil glut occurred, doubling down on the oil and gas business seemed like an inept decision to me, especially in the face of a looming cash flow problem. Remember, we were told by the former management that the decline  in revenue would reverse when the oil barrel price stabilized at $60 or higher. That seems to be the case, but we have not seen any improvement in the new company stock. Perhaps the first quarter numbers will reveal an up swing, but i’m In the show me skeptical camp now.",

"One funny observation about this author, where he writes an elaborate, rational, well thought out argument that the stock will be up 59% in due time from his date of publication, when the stock just a few days ago was over 14 bucks.

These volume spikes can last a while at major generational bottoms.  The volume spike on FCX, freeport mcmoran, lasted about 3 months, and then the stock went from 4 bucks to 12 in a year.  Not saying that will happen but these sustained volume spikes are a good sign.  Love this stock in the 13's.",

Assuming management, which has some excellent, world class businesses, is not a total phouck up, I think the stock can rebound here, as they get the rot out of the culture.

The price may be built into the trading for guarded outlook, but that reflects the unfortunate state of GE.

We wont know the bottom in GE until we have a stressed market and GE stops dribbling out bad news. GE has been living a lie for several decades. I do suspect GE makes its low in 2018 as it slowly comes clean with investors.If I did what GE has done I would be in jail. Probably the biggest risk is if GE has to cut or eliminate the dividend. Clearly it is still cash strapped. As usual few understand the GE Capital segment and its status. My guess is that GE cannot borrow any money without lowering its credit rating. So investors are left with the question of cash flow meeting capital and dividend needs. Analyst Tusa is the one voice that has integrity though time will tell whether he is too negative.,

"Currently you can buy Eaton and Siemens on a 5% FCF yield to Enterprise Value.Why buy GE?For me, GE has a broken balance sheet worth a $100B.GE generated FCF of $2.5B in 2017 and the feeling out there is that this figure will do down in 2018. OTOH, GE is a company that in recent history was generating $12-$15B in FCF per year.I would only consider buying GE at a 6% FCF yield to EV. Why buy GE if I can buy Siemens or Eaton today on 5%.Market cap of GE is $118B. Its enterprise value is $218B given its poor balance sheet that is burdened with huge debt and pension liabilities despite large cash and long term security holdings.Let's say we assume GE can generate $8B in FCF. I am being kind in this assumption.The FCF/EV is only 3.7%. This is not deep value terriory. I can buy great companies like MSFT, GOOGL, PYPL, AAPL, MU, ORCL for  much better value than 3.7% in all cases right now today.For GE to get to 6% FCF yield on $8B in FCF it must trade at market cap of $30B. Its c. $120B today. So I think you should expect to see a 50-75% drop in GE from here. There is no logical reason to hold or buy GE IMO",

I do not think GE will go completely bust, we need to keep in mind the value of GE's various businesses. One of these days, we will see a volume spike and later learn a guy such as Warren ""I'll buy GE at the right price"" Buffet has jumped in. We are thinking to wait it out for the catalyst to hit and harvest some short call premium.",

"""At the same time, it doesn't appear RV sales are going to slow down anytime soon. In fact, Thor Industries is reporting a backlog of $2.8 billion which is a 34% increase over the prior year. While Camping World Holdings does not report backlog numbers, it would be unlikely that only Thor Industries is seeing an increase in future orders.""Do you understand how cyclical markets work?  Toward the peak of the cycle, demand outstrips manufacturing capacity and dealer inventory.  The manufacturers dump a pile of money into expanding capacity (CapEx, overpriced acquisitions, rapid expansion of workforce at higher rates).  Retailers and customers face delays, and the more they sense this, the more they double-order and the more they pull future demand into current orders (better to get an excess delivery now and hold it in the warehouse or on the lot, than run short what with the sensational customer demand).When the cycle turns, inevitably the manufacturer has taken on a ton of extra cost at just the time revenue begins to fall -- which creates a double-speed compression of margins.  And the manufacturer rarely realizes until it's too late.  Why?  B/c they believe the order book.  Then they find out that the order book is double or triple the size of the actual end-demand, b/c their customers have double- and triple ordered.And on the retail front, all the dealers (like CWH) who over-ordered so they were able to meet demand, get the double-whammy of expanding their inventories by the maximum amount, just at the time end-demand begins falling.  Then, drowning in inventory, they chase the market.  If they bite the bullet and blow out the inventory at losses, it hurts.  If they do like homeowners in a softening market, and lower a bit at a time, even as the offers go lower at just a step ahead of them, it's a long and painful ride.""While the market is not always rational, there is usually some semblance of a reason investors become less bullish on a stock. In the case of Camping World Holdings, the reasons seem to have little to do with performance or fundamentals.""And there you have it.  You believe you know more than the market.  It's the market that's wrong, not you.  It's the market that's irrational, not you.  The price performance has ""little to do with performance or fundamentals""?  I would suggest to you that you've got it exactly backwards -- that the price performance has everything to do with performance and fundamentals of the business.  Here are the fundamentals you need to track: (1) DSOs (days sales outstanding): (2) ratio of inventory to daily sales; (3) Order obligations (deposits required by Thor, etc); (4) Percentage of sales financed; (5) Length of time from first customer contact to final sale.With the benefit of hindsight, you're going to come to realize the market isn't ""irrational"" -- it just knows more than you do about future demand and where we are in the cycle.Again, back to your original comment: ""At the same time, it doesn't appear RV sales are going to slow down anytime soon.""  Ask yourself what metrics you are watching that would enable you to see whether this is a true statement or whether this is just something you believe, but for which you have no rational basis.",

"I'm a Camping World customer, unfortunately.  Actually a former customer.  Camping World is great at buying up new dealerships and stores, and also at promoting and marketing themselves.  They are terrible at actually running the dealerships they have recently bought.  It seems to me, at least at the Gulf Coast dealership where I happened to buy a camper from them, since they were the only one within 200 miles that had the particular model I wanted, that they have an extremely high employee turnover rate (the most common thing I hear from one of their employees is ""oh, well I wasn't working here then, I've only been here a month), and they can't begin to get the service department organized well enough to deliver the necessary level of customer service that it will take to retain customers.  They will have you bring your camper in for service thinking they have the parts in stock, but when you get there, turns out the parts aren't in stock and you hauled your camper there for nothing.  They order the wrong parts, then they will rob the right part off their new camper inventory, then they sell those same new campers not even knowing that they lack certain key parts needed to go camping!  Does that make people happy?  I can tell you it does not.  These guys are growing like crazy purely on marketing.  They are unable to hire and retain the needed skilled labor to run a quality service department, and also their sales practices are beyond sleazy (they ask for you permission to sell your email and other contact information to spammers; without asking you they will hand a phone to you with an insurance salesman on the other end; they sell you on a finance agreement that is so lucrative for them that they will give you thousands off the camper if you will finance it rather than pay cash, even if you tell them you're going to pay the loan off in a short period of time.)  Much of what they do borders on the dishonest.I predict that CWH will be successful for a relatively short period of time.  Their reputation is spreading rapidly and it isn't a good reputation.  They will ultimately be worth next to nothing.  If you want to get into the explosion of interest in RV'S buy THO and not CWH.",

"Hi Vlad.As usual very interesting article.Regarding Middle East Gulf- a year ago I said that there is a lot of activity and Jack up segment will be the first one ( and maybe the only one) to enjoy market recovery. Here rigs are operating on 30 ft water depths 😃, companies are employing a cheap but qualified enough crews from India, Pakistan, Philippines, rarely white expats. They are working for a fraction of the salary whites normally gets on deep water floaters.Everything here is much cheaper, upfront investment, operation costs, manning.I hear the break even cost is 14$/gallon here. How any UDW 6 the generation DP beauty could compete with this ? Deep water drilling is very expensive, you can't skip the certifications and survey costs, must have highly qualified crew, much more expensive equipment and budget to maintain it. Up front costs and operational costs drilling on water depths >1000 m are tremendous. I still hold to my bet that increased activity on shallow water and shale drilling will be a barrier for UDW segment to recover.Here and there the newest rigs are getting some job, but that's not enough to say market is recovering. Still short therm contracts on poor day rates.Here in Persian Gulf I see a lot is going on.ADNOC consolidated all those NDC, ZADCO, ADMA. They are just came into agreement with Total and Eni to further development Zaker and other fields to boost production.They are going to build a huge petrochemical complex to get more involved in final product.So, my bet is that it may take little longer for deep water drilling to recover.",

Ultimately the stand alone shares will be 40-50 cents as they show progress toward re-opening the TN operation.The final value in June is around $2.50.  So much of the delta is Canada operations.I think by the time of the deal close in mid-June it will back to $4, since good chance the strike will also have been settled.  They said that they could start production again in May and be at full capacity by year-end.  That should help.",
Im not an expert.  Just spent awhile reading Q&A on the strike.  Seems the primary hangup is between what HL calls a nid system of worker assignments versus a progressive system.  When I dont understand someone elses choice of terms I simplify it for my simple mind.  If Im seeing it correctly its about favoritism versus merit.  Allegedly the workers are striking until the company agrees to let them dictate certain kob assignments.  I would generally lean toward workers but if thats really what this is about I would stand with the company.  Id rathet have my career dictated by my deserved merit than by whos butt I have to kiss any time.,
Thanks for the update on how the workers at strike for Lucky Friday are surviving. It does seem the author is more clear on his comment reply's then the article itself. It is hard to be a writer. I suppose then these miners will have no problem holding out for another year if need be based on the list of tricks they have up their sleeves to keep food on the table for them and the family.,
Worth noting that Hecla used to own the Hollister mine and sold for $60 million back in 2007.,

"If I understand the Klondex Q4 preso correctly, AISC per equivalent ounce gold was $1143 and AIC (all in costs) was $1284. For 2017 YE, AISC is $1149 and AIC is $1348. There is some room for profit at higher gold prices, but right now they appear to be a break-even operation. Hecla appears to be acquiring ounce totals in preparation for a higher gold price and probably also hope to realize some operational cost reductions over what Klondex was able to accomplish. A good time to acquire more ounces but this one is costly. Brilliant move if gold continues upward, which a lot of us expect it to.",
"HL is being punished by the arbs. They would sell it to zero if there was even a fraction of a cent in the arbitrage. Happens every time. You could have tripled your money if you bought Kirkland a year ago when it was going through the same thing. HL is a great deal now, and if the arbs keep selling it down, it just gets to be a better deal. Bought a 1/4 position today at 3.26, and might get to fill it out cheaper. Who knows. But in the long run, I think HL will prove to be a great deal here.",
"According to HL CEO they paid 460M$ to earn 40M$ p.a cash flow. That is a 8,5% yield. Not bad.",

"Good article. Agree.Can anyone explain how the workers of Lucky Friday can strike a whole year? I don't quite understand. They have family, they need income. Where from do they live? It is about 200-250 unionized workers, each might earn 50000-100000 dollars per year. This strike costs the union millions of bucks. Unimaginable!

According to todays Barrons the consensus eps estimates for Swir are 87 cents this year and $1.25 next year. The reason for the depressed expectations for this year was a weak first quarter in which they made only 9 cents. The company claims that this quarter was caused by unusual one time items. The midpoint of the second quarter guidance which was 21 cents backs up this assertion. Lets assume that they would have made 20 cents in quarter 1 without these special items.. Then eps would have been 98 cents this year. If we believe the Street estimates for next year then the eps growth would represent  a 27 percent eps growth rate from 2018 to 2019. If you back out net cash of about $2 per share then the stock is only trading at a price earnings multiple of 13 times 2019 eps ex cash. . If they make these numbers the stock is dirt cheap.,
I just read the article on page a12 of todays Investors Business Daily. The article discusses the formation of multiple funds dedicated to participating in the growth of the electric and the autonomous car markets. Since 100% of all autonomous cars have to be connected and Swir has at least a 35% market share in the auto connectivity market it seems to me that sooner or later some of these new funds will buy swir as a direct play in the autonomous care market.,
"After listening to the Swir presentation at the Jeffries conference I have concluded that Swir represents a long term play in three areas. First it is a play on iot connectivity. The giant contract with VW which will start to kick in during the second half of this year is an example of this part of the business. Second, it is a play on growth in the edge of the internet. Swir defines this as helping companies manage their connected devices. The margins in this business are 50% higher than in the core iot business the the growth rate in revenues is about 3 times greater than in the core iot connectivity business. Mke Dell who claims that the opportunites  in the edge of the internet are not appreciated by the market loves this segment. Also as much as 50% of the revenues in this business segment are recurring revenues which a rational market would award a much higher price to sales ration to than  is currently the case. Finally it is a play on autonomous  vehicles since all of these vehicles need to be connected. Only 30% of new cars are currently offering connectivity. Nividia is awarded being awarded a huge valuation premium because of the expectation that it will participate in this trend but Swir which will have  at least a 30% market share in the modules which will be requried  in this business is not even mentioned in the conversation. Dell should just buy this company right now.",
Swir paid more like 2X AND with 900K shares they bought back for $12/share and flipped for 29.60.. I’d say they bought really well and once the market see’s solid growth in IOT services the shares should react accordingly,
the main reason that the stock is trading at these depressed levels is that every 3rd or 4th quarter some hardware issue in  the oem division  rears its ugly head and destroys the consistency of earnings growth. Now hardware only represents only 70% of total revenues.  The  other 2 divisions which sell to the edge of the internet have margins which are at least 50% higher than the hardware division and growth rates at least 3 times the estimated growth rate of the oem division which is probably between 5% and 10%. In addition these two divisions generate a lot of recurring revenue which does not exist in the oem divison. One of these divisions grew 52% year over year last quarter.  The stock is trading as if these 2 divisions do not exist. I cant believe a private equity firm does not offer a 50% premium and buy this company,

"I am amazed that nobody who is going on the Air or writing articles about Sierra Wireless have picked up that SWIR has an estimated 5-6 Billion Dollars booked over the next 60 Months beginning in 2019..  If you look at the current run rate of 180 Mil per qtr, that is only 3.6B!!  layer in Toyota and VW wins adds another Estimated 1.8 Billion.. This does not include any NEW Design wins that will start in the next 5 years which we are not aware of... Back that out and you have a significant ramp coming starting in May 2019 (first full report of VW in Q1 2019) Layer in Toyota (assumed its Toyota) in late 2019 and off we go... Unbelievable opportunity to dig in now at 16 with such a massive pay out which will rise over the next 12-36 months... Seems pretty clear to me with what management has already announced as of today.. Imagine the coming proliferation of 5G and other programs which will layer over current bookings.. FirstNet, eCall, LPWA, etc..None of this is baked in the stock today and coming in Months... I would like to see a secondary NCIB this next QTR for about 500K-1MM shares which should help the share count be close to 2016 levels (prior to the recent completed  NCIB) and offsets further the NMRX purchase.. SWIR essentially purchased shares at 11/share and traded them at 29.60 to NMRX and has an opportunity to buy some shares back for 16-18 range if they act fast.. The reasons the stock is down was mainly due to the initial Drop from NMRX and the timing of that created an opportunity to sell SWIR shares to offset gains from the broader market.round 2 of that came once NMRX major holders received the SWIR shares and those investors used the Lower Share price to offset gains in other areas of the portfolio.. This is an amazing opportunity for those who see what is unfolding..Disclosure: Long 36,575 shares and still buying here...Do your own DD, ask questions directly to the company and Follow the money...

"It will take a strong board and engaged individual investors to hold off an acquisition.  With 25.7% of shares held by institutions, and approximately 1.5% held by insiders, the individual holders have the votes to hold off an acquisition, but they will need to act if one is offered.  The IOT market is getting into position to take off with the other pieces maturing fast.  Big Data analytics is growing very fast (CLDR and HDP) which is where the data collected and transmitted is monetized.  In my opinion when those two stocks take off with both sales and EPS companies will not be able to connect things fast enough.  The problem is the new tax law has made a lot of money available for acquisitions and I'm certain that SWIR is on a number of acquisition lists.  Could very well be a bidding war for this company.  The self driving car problems will have no negative impact since cars is 1 tenth of 1% of the connectivity market.  I believe the current price is due to the NMRX acquisition.  Too many think it is a short term drain, however SWIR has opportunities to increase it's North American sales due to the NMRX sales staff.  NMRX could potentially provide a quick uptick in sales if their old 2G customers decide to upgrade technology through SWIR.  I've owned this stock three times and I have been satisfied to the company reacting to market changes.  In the early early part of the last decade they guessed right with the aircard and did well.  They adapted as aircard was obsolete due to embedded modules and were early to identify IoT which at that time was called M2M.  I like others got tired a few years ago constantly hearing about design wins, but what was missing was actually broad market demand for connectivity while at the same time the standards were sill being developed.  Many of those growing pains are gone and I like many others would not like to see higher long term gains sacrificed for a quick acquisition.",

"@Nick Cole.Thank you for a great article on Apple in India.  I want to add three points.  First, it is hard to judge sales of Apple sales in India due to the high tariffs that India imposes on imported products.  A majority of Indians buy their Apple products overseas to save money.  I suspect that millions of iPhones are being purchased overseas and brought back to India because of the 20% price difference due to the tariffs.Second, a thriving black market for used and refurbished iPhones competes against new iPhone sales.  You can see this on Amazon India.  Almost everywhere you go in India, stores are advertising repairs of iPhones and refurbished iPhones for sale. No iPhone is thrown away. The used and refurbished iPhone market, like overseas purchase of iPhones by travelIng Indians, is largely invisible to organizations tracking iPhone sales in India.Third, India recently imposed a 20% tariff on components that Apple imports to India, including batteries. Even when made in India, tariffs on imported components add to the costs of iPhone SE’s.  The incentive for Apple to manufacture iPhones in India is low.  They can’t get away from the tariffs even when they assemble the iPhone SE in India.In short, I think iPhone sales and use by people in India are much higher than what sales figures in India suggest.  Most Indians buy their iPhones overseas and bring it back to India rather than buy the iPhone in India and pay the 20% tariff.  Almost all iPhones in India are resold as used or refurbished (officially or unofficially).  These sales are probably not registered in market share numbers.  Finally, Apple gets hit with tariffs on imported components when they make the iPhone SE in India and therefore has little incentive to move manufacturing to India.",
"India will become a significant market for Apple in 3-5 years. It is taking all the right steps to establish a firm base in the country and the fruits of its efforts will increasingly be seen in the years ahead. And, yes, Indian millennials are no different than their counterparts elsewhere in the world.",
"Apple may be releasing an iPhone SE v.2 near the end of this year... that would make it the cheapest iPhone available, and the smallest. If Apple does this, it could provide huge dividends regarding customer acquisition, which in turn manifests into customer retention, which all contributes to Apple's other services benefiting as a result of using it's products (music, apps, AR, maybe cars, etc.).",
"India will be slower developing than China but the same factors are or will be there.  As the youth and economy changes, disposable income will find its way to aspirational products and services.I think that’s the big Apple bump of the early 2020s.  There will be a breakout year  there like in China a few years back.  You want to be holding Apple when that shoe drops.",

"In this meticulously researched and written article, there is little or no attention paid to recent changes in the management and organization of Pandora. John Malone, the multi-billionaire owner of Liberty Media, twice tried to acquire Pandora. In 2016 he offered $15/share at a time when I believe that Pandora was selling for about $10. Twice rejected, Malone settled for a strategic investment of $480 million, which was taken from the coffers of SiriusXM Satellite. Liberty Media controls SiriusXM through ownership of about 70 percent of the latter.In return for the investment, SiriusXM received a stake of about 20 percent in Pandora and three seats on its Board of Directors. Malone placed his own CEO of Liberty Media, Greg Maffei, as Chairman of the Board and the other two seats were taken by top executives of SiriusXM.Malone has made a career out of snapping up distressed media companies at bargain rates and turning them around. SiriusXM represents his latest triumph. SiriusXM was on the brink of bankruptcy, with its shares selling for (so they say) a nickel each, when Malone loaned the company enough to keep it afloat in exchange for about 40 percent of SiriusXM. Malone increased his ownership of SiriusXM through purchase of shares on the open market until he took over voting control. The price of SiriusXM shares has increased from that nickel to over $6.00 and last year SiriusXM generated $1.5 billion in free cash on revenues of $5.4 billion.Malone coming to the aid of SiriusXM was rather analogous to the United States coming to the aid of Great Britain in World War II after the fall of France.What does Pandora get from now having such rich relations? Liquidity. A license to spend freely to improve itself. Legitimacy. Berkshire Hathaway has a ten percent stake in SiriusXM. And presumably guidance in its dealings from experienced managers at the top of their game.Of course almost all assume that Malone's ultimate intention is still to acquire or control Pandora. This might not be as simple as it was in the case of Malone and his Liberty Media gaining control over SiriusXM. SiriusXM agreed to purchase no more Pandora shares for 18 months. At the end of that period, which comes up in December, I believe that SiriusXM is still restricted from taking more than a 31 percent stake in Pandora without the approval of the Pandora Board of Directors, with the SiriusXM appointed directors not participating. But ultimately it is still believed that Malone will add Pandora to his small media empire.Meanwhile, what might the association of Pandora with SiriusXM bring about to help Pandora? SiriusXM CEO and now Pandora Board member James Meyer had this to say last July on the earnings conference call:""We also will be able to learn more about the subscription interactive business and how our two companies might work together in the future, be it on upselling, cross-selling, sharing content, or sharing technology. I caution you that our deal still needs requisite government approvals. We will only be a minority investor in Pandora, and our investment is not predicated on any kind of cooperation or synergies.""""That said, we look forward to working with the team at Pandora and we will be able to talk more about this exciting investment after the closing of our agreement expected later this year.""To my knowledge there has been no specific talk yet about this ""exciting investment"" (which of course received approval). We have been told that the two companies are still in the state of getting to know one another, but specifics will follow.Any joint marketing with the SiriusXM juggernaut can only help Pandora. As to content, we are left to speculate. SiriusXM has many music channels, including some with exclusive content or hosts. Some of the most popular channels could be bundled with Pandora on a permanent or rotating basis.Perhaps it might be more useful to look at all the non-music channels on SiriusXM, covering news, business, sports, talk, comedy and entertainment. As there is really little to distinguish the on-demand subscription services of Apple iTunes, Spotify and Pandora Premium, the addition of popular non-music channels would immediately set Pandora apart. These channels, unlike the music channels, have limited advertising. The others might be left scrambling to catch up.But I confess that I'm really not qualified to discuss the ways that brotherhood with SiriusXM could benefit Pandora. I do know that they exist.My apologies for hijacking the comments section.",

"What a wickedly thorough piece.  And although I do not follow GE anymore its poor performance over such a long period can be explained in four words: ""Jack Welch's manufactured earnings"".  When I did follow the stock at the end of the 90's it was quite clear Welch and his accounting cohorts were cooking the books to manufacture earnings so they would beat the street, no matter what the earnings were.  By means of the four accounting horseman: FIFO, FILO, LILO, and LIFO and other quasi-chicanery methods he could take or give earnings from a  current quarter in a manner that showed consistent growth.  In doing so he essentially rigged the stock in a legal but highly unethical manner.While he was not alone in this dipsy-doodle, irrespective of the 2008 debacle, GE continues to get punished for having to quietly unravel that scheme-which can take decades to appropriately window dress.  So I can not put all the blame on Imult, but rather on a malfeasant accounting culture that took years to bring it back to sanity,GE is a great example of how companies in protracted bull marketscan skew their earnings to look like they are experiencing seamlessgrowth.  The problem is just like GE was everybody's darling in the 90's,Amazon or Apple or any high flying company that allows analysts to dictate what they need to keep the runaway trains from crashing can hide transparency by making sure magical numbers are manufactured late at night in a conference room filled with accountants(I am not suggesting Amazon or Apple does this).Not knowing anything about the current stock,   I wish you and all GE holders prosperity.

"With due respect, all of the math done and trying to discern long term performance based on the publicly available information on this company, with its truly opaque financial reporting, is hardly reliable.  That’s really the problem.  We keep experiencing one more shoe dropping after another on the financial reporting.  When Flannery had to drop the bomb on the multi-billion dollar adjustment to reserves associated with the GE Financial screw-ups (or true ups for actual risk) it was for me just another dead canary in the GE coal mine of putrid financial gas.  He may be a fine man, but anyone counting on a GE lifer like Flannery to lead the charge on positive cultural change (like telling the truth internally and externally) is taking a real leap in my view.  I do want GE to succeed, I just remain skeptical about that prospect without real, meaningful change at the top.",
"Selling power is a nonesense alternative and transportation is poor performing by what measure? The sale of appliances is really a case of a management which is so anxious to do port folio management, it has lost its ability to be logical. Selling a business which to many has characterized GE to so many and permitting the buyer to use the GE name seems like desperation. The company that bought major appliances is a Chinese company. I also don’t understand the government’s logic that prevented the sale previously because of anti-trust considerations agreeing to a sale to the Chinese of an American Icon. Further, major appliances was profitable. One should ask, did the money received from this sale get put to use to produce as much profit?

"Thanks to the author for this interesting write-up on GE and his sum of the parts valuation. One minor criticism I have is this statement: <<The worst performing segment of GE, GE Capital, will have to be sold or closed down.>>As most followers of GE know, a portion of GE Capital is long-term care insurance. Long-term care insurance, as the name suggests, are policies of insurance usually purchased by middle-age to older individual customers who have not yet had to move out of their own homes, condos, or apartments into assisted living or nursing homes. These policies have a long-tail exposure. A fifty year old customer who buys a long-term care policy might live another 30 years or more.If the sale of long-term care policies were made with certain underwriting assumptions in place ten or more years ago, such as Hepatitis could be a death sentence within a few years of diagnosis, or most types of lung cancer were not treatable and there were no good drugs to even extend life for another eight months or so, then likely the long-term care policies GE Capital sold were sold with faulty underwriting assumptions. GE Capital, therefore, cannot just be ""shut down"". If GE is not going to be the payor to honor these policies, GE will likely have to pay another financial institution to accept this book of business and the long-term exposure the policies inherently have at risk.Insurance companies issue policies because the policy holders want to shift the risk of loss to an institution which have the financial means to pay a loss, even if the loss were to occur years in the future. Shutting down an insurance book of business is not an option as such action would run afoul of state insurance regulators throughout the country.",
"Believe that David is on the right track - GE needs to run what they own with best practices. Say GE sells Transportation - then the $800 million of operating income comes out of cash flow which further pressures funds available for dividend, debt pay down, pension obligation support, etc. Likewise, throwing BHGE overboard gives up on any rebound. Seems that best practices should do much better than 1% margins (see prior years on lower revenue). As with Power, is there a staffing plan that streamlines that organization?As the author points out, there are only two ""locomotives"" for growth - Aviation and Medical. The other potential strength - Power is too wounded for reliable projections. For example, how is the division functioning after the almost 20% layoff. No doubt project deliverables will slip until the new organization comes together. Possibly customers could go elsewhere causing revenue losses.I also question the use of EBITDA on these businesses since the allocation of corporate expenses, annual pension contribution obligations and LTD are not reflected. In standalone companies all are included in one place. In addition, expanding Renewable Energy might require major Cap Ex, yet earn margins of 6-7%. That is not a good foundation for building free cash flow.",
Basing your valuations on 2016 #'s makes no sense at all to me as I'm sure we all understand that GE' problems have increased by an order of magnitude since then.,
"Remember Warren Buffet is one record recently indicating he'd buy GE at the right price and that it was a big strong company.  This was in January 2018 when GE was 18.61. His follow up interview in Feb he stated GE was a wonderful company when it was at 16. I don't know about these analysts, they always seem a day and a penny short; but i would take Buffets blessing over their analysis any  day of the week. Oh, also look up insider buying back in November and you will see atleast 4 insiders buying substantial shares. Now i know insiders can try to manipulate and show confidence by buying shares but did director James Tisch really have to buy 3,000,000 shares at roughly $18 per share for $54 million?! Long GE",
"GE is now down to 13.70.If it falls to 9, I will buy more shares.",
Transportation is a cyclical business. Selling it when it is down sounds like an Immelt move. I would suggest selling it when the rail market (locomotives) rebounds. In the meantime GE could still benefit from the high level of profitability transportation division generates even in a down market cycle.,
"Thank you for your thoughtful article.I take a somewhat different view though, naturally enough, I have no influence on what GE's management chooses to do.I would like to see GE focus on running its existing businesses better rather than focusing on reshuffling the portfolio. The problem with selling underperforming businesses is that you rarely get a good price for them. Investment bankers like to speak about ""unlocking value"" but we should remember that these were the same people who five years earlier were pushing the company to do synergistic acquisitions.Everyone is down on GE Power right now, but this is not an intrinsically bad business. It was just mismanaged and became bloated. As for GE Baker Hughes, there is every reason to believe that if these assets are well run they will be able to significantly increase their financial performance over the next few years. The fact that Jeff Immelt and the Board felt so comfortable selling low and buying high has destroyed a lot of value for GE shareholders. GE Baker Hughes isn't going to magically turn into a great investment if we simply wait long enough. But the losses due to bad deal making are a sunk cost that is never coming back. That doesn't mean that GE Baker Hughes can't earn respectable returns going forward.GE is going to sell assets. I get that. But I would rather have them rebuild the balance sheet by cutting or eliminating the dividend while avoiding selling assets at fire-sale prices.Best wishes,Davidbuying GE at current prices.",
"nice work, thank you for your effort. In the next weak days I will buy my final, third tranche of GE. The average price will then be 16$ and I will wait until 20$ because the dividend is at least 3 p.c. in the meantime (with potential in 2 years....).",
"So in other words, do what Immelt did and sell low on underperforming assets.Yes, they're not attractive businesses, but you somehow think someone else will pay anywhere close to fair value for the same junk you want to unload?Baker Hughes is underperforming because energy is in a valley.

"An important point to note here which seems to be lost on most except those of us who work in the tech industry is that almost all Apps (and websites) that rely on ad revenues collect data and apply unique user IDs and/or cookies in order to better understand profile behaviors and utilize for retargeting advertising messages. There is a whole industry worth billions of dollars focused on helping marketers match different data sources and refine audiences for retargeting, often across thousands of websites and apps.

"""the process used by Cambridge Analytica and allegedly Steve Bannon and the Trump campaign to collect information on 50 million Facebook users ""This is a horrendously inaccurate and seeming intentionally misleading statement, seemingly influenced by ""fake"" stories in the media that attempt to create a link to Trump that his campaign participated in this collection of data. At best, it could be suggested (though still not yet known), that while the Trump campaign used CA for online/social media advertising, there is zero evidence that there was any participation in this data collecting by the Trump campaign - which would obviously be understood when one realizes the dates that this  personal data was collected - well prior to Trump even being a candidate.I expect such efforts by the US mass media, after all, they attempt to make it appear that any bad event that happens is somehow related to Trump.  Much like their comments about Russia collusion and their next sentence referencing indictments of Trump campaign officers (leaving out the fact that the indictments were based on actions many years before Trump was even a candidate and that the indictments had nothing to do with collusion). These comments, while factual, are in fact fake news - meant to mislead the purveyors of that media.That said, this whole thing (FB/CA) shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody who understands the internet, the value of data, how much of the revenue is generated by so many of these ""tech"" companies, and the increased value of ever more specific personal data. Of course, we all (most) freely and openly give away this data - and to some degree it does benefit us in doing so.

Facebook gave the Obama campaign access to the personal data of users in 2011 because the company was in his pocket. How did the stock react then? Oh wait... no one cared.,

Data was collected from unknowing individuals via FaceBook and was transferred to a foreign entity, who then turned around and sold the data to the highest bidder. And once the data is out, who knows what else was accessing it. I’m sure the Democrats were also doing the same thing. Par for the course. Still, I would like to know how much FB sold this information for, or any political data they collect, and also who else did they sell political information to. And this is on top of them profiting off of Russian bots trying to throw the election. It seems they have no sense social responsibility and will sell data or allow data to be propagated in their ecosystem for any price. No scruples. I think the American people need answers here. I’ll feel guilty, but I’ll buy at $100.",
I don't get it? Facebook is what it is a very profitable social media platform with over a billion users. There is no other advertising media one can use to reach this size audience for their sales pitch.

Why doesn't this same logic apply to national advertiser's stocks who sponsor Fox and right wing radio  or MSNBC?  Why aren't their investors selling their shares since their programming is basically free campaign advertising and in the case of Fox and Hannity and Limbaugh full of lies and false talking point.   Unless Facebook starts to lose 10s of millions of users  it is a great buying opportunity now.,

"This situation is being blown up by the legacy media as an opportunity to try and bury FB to try and recapture the revenue drain of advertising going to social media.  In addition social media has become more influential than the hodge podge of legacy media outlets.  Times have changed and left legacy media in the dust.  If you consider all the other hijacked data, Equfax, OPM, etc, etc, you will see this was minimal and wasn’t even done by FB.  This all the media, and it’s 1% owners.",
"This is how you make money:step 1: buy a problem.  not just any problem. one that is easily fixed. For instance, if $100 billion is knocked off the market cap of Facebook over some problem that facebook addicts do not even care about, it may be a problem worth buying. you buy the problem because in sunnier days Facebook went for over 20x sales. Now it goes for under 20x next year earnings.step 2: you wait for facebook to solve this problem. It won't cost $100 billion to do so. step 3: you profit from the stupidity of others. Rest assured the axis of evil (Russia, Trump and Facebook) will fall into line. If the Russians do not fall into line, they'll be a new arms race benefiting the people who are drumming up all this trouble. The people in the deep state that spy on us 24/7 and know the tiniest detail of our lives and have stripped us entirely of our privacy and dignity are the ones going after Facebook for third party privacy violations...and the deep state is going afterTrump...and making up lies about Russia. So long as America continues spending hundreds of billions on war and arms, everything will be alright.

I am not even sure if this was unethical forget illegal. Surveys are done all the time and it is for the person holding the knowledge to decide to share that knowledge unless he or she is under a Confidentiality Agreement.Facebook is just another victim because it helped Trump's campaign. Just like the burger and pizza firm that delivered late night food to the Trump Campaign enabling them to stay late at work.When you provide information to someone, even in the form of a quiz (remember those dinner quiz called survey), you are providing information about yourself and your neighbors and friends and neighborhood. That is not leaking. When we create a portfolio on Seeking Alpha or respond in messages. Expect that this data is being crunched by servers and statistcical rpograms of where the activity is.

BTW, Trump appealed to core values held dear by old school democrats - namely jobs, protectionism (unions) and patriotism.  Also, I don’t think he could have won against any other democrat candidate.  Hillary was the undoing of Democrats in 2016.Facebook is the scapegoat for democrats mishandling of the campaign.

Furthermore, she openly claims that Facebook gave the Obama campaigners a pass because of their political affiliation.Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing,” Davidsen wrote on Twitter.""""Mark Zuckerberg’s company saw its shares plummet after the news broke that the Trump campaign had utilized Facebook data during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.If Davidsen’s accusation is indeed true, it could prove a serious problem for Facebook. In the case of the Trump campaign, Facebook’s allowance for the misuse of its data was an accidental oversight; as far as the Obama campaign goes, it appears that it was completely intentional.""Now what is troubling is that Facebook knew that this issue with Cambridge Analytica  has been heating up for over 6 or more months and Mark Zuckerberg sold a lot of stock since January 2, 2018 knowing that the stock could tank at any time when the news of this political missile hits the news.   I think that the SEC needs to investigate what did Faceboook, Mark Zuckerberg and others know at the company as he personally manipulated shares by selling ahead of this news hitting the media..",
thanks for the crystal clear analysis,
Thanks for the explanation.,
The democrats got caught by Facebook in 2012 and Facebook who agreed with the Democrats mining of date then was complicit and gave them more access. This is all about politics. Democrat politics. They assisted and give them access after being caught because it fit their politics. Cambridge Analytica did the same thing and Facebook didn't agree with their mining as it undermined their political views. Did Cambridge Analytica hack Facebook or did they just go online and mine they data that was in the public domain. Does Facebook have the right to control what is out there? We have seen facebook censer what is posted but can they block anybody from using date that one can seize on their own by mining it. Seems this is all part of marketing and knowing what is there.This is nothing more than another way to focus on Anti-Trump / Russia gate.   American's are tired of the political crap and that will eventually be the demise of a site like Facebook.  It pits friends and family  against each other when their political view are different.,

Everyone talked about the first Netflix originals because it’s all that we had as a society and it was shockingly good. But now the other players are doing the same thing and ganging up. Fresh original content is springing up everywhere. What value will Netflix Originals content retain as viewership dilutes? The sheer number of titles being released will cause the age of pop culture to drift further away from media.Yet they trade at the same PE as Amazon? Heck no.

"Whitney that's actually some great advice.  I'm very bullish on NFLX and think the business is still underlevered - I am conscious though that my view is at one end of a spectrum of opinion.  I would fill my boots if offered stock at a 10% discount.  My guess is that the issue would be many times subscribed and that the adjusted post-rights price would rapidly prove to be highly accretive.  There are many who do have concerns around NFLX's leverage and FCF and a large rights issue would put those worries to rest, setting the stock up for another leg higher.  Lastly, better to raise equity when you don't really need to, rather than waiting for the HY market to throw a tantrum, which it does occasionally.  However, as NFLX can raise funds at 5-6% by issuing bonds, it isn't an obvious call - arguably the fact that they haven't launched a rights issue is the most bullish signal of them all, as it indicates that management are convinced they can generate enough internal capital to deliver their business plan...",
Now would certainly be a great time to issue stock. NFLX is in somewhat better position than Tesla since they can cut back on content spend if growth slows.,

Firstly, they continue to confirm and provide further detail on the extent and continuity of the complex breccia mineralization below the proposed pit,” said Greg McCunn, Chief Executive Officer. “In addition, the hydrothermal breccia structure that lies south of the proposed pit continues to show mineralization over wide intersections near surface and may turn out to be a second mineralized breccia pipe altogether.  We are looking forward to seeing the results from the next three drill holes to see how this develops.”  The Company has initiated an extensive exploration program at Ana Paula which includes in addition to the surface drill program:Exploration drilling from an underground decline targeting an extension to the high-grade breccia below the proposed open pit and a skarn target below the breccia (decline construction commenced with drilling expected in Q3 2018); Surface drilling to test a high priority target that is 100 metres north of the proposed open pit (drilling to commence following the completion of the surface drill program in Q1 2018); and Regional exploration work on the 56,000 hectare land package including an airborne magnetic survey targeting further breccia or skarn targets (ongoing in 2018).

"Tom, in short, I think - ALO decision is unreasonable at best and works against shareholders if to believe some rumors out there. I look at this in a simple and logical way - with 100M loan ALO would spend 30M in interest cost at worst in 3 years. Right? Then shareholders would keep all the AP profits + SF profits.But with this proposed suspicious deal - we lose 29M, lose 50% of profits on AP and 50% of profits on SF and WE DO NOT GAIN anything with price of gold below $1100 and I would argue ALO shareholders can lose the company!Gold can really fall below $1100. It is VERY PROBABLE. I actually consider it as a real target for December EOY level. Gold in my opinion will most likely be $1100 end of year not higher. I am so convinced about it - that I am betting on it actually. ALO strength is low AISC at AP - that is going to be thrown away in few weeks. The more I think about it - the more I see that some opinions people have out there may be correct. This deal is unreasonable and exposes shareholders to risks of major loses. But that would be nothing new for ALO shareholders since the new man took helm.",
"Aside from the above - what concerns me - is the gold price in light of the FOMC policy changes. There is absolutely no guarantee - the market can withstand the current rates. Right now San Francisco is profitable down to maybe $1030, but we really cannot rule out a possibility of gold falling under that level in case of a severe market downturn. I would like to remind you of law changes to how the FED responds to systemic market problems. It will not be like in 2008. They now reconfigured their definitions of systemic banking risks, and they may not issue money like they did in the past. There is no guarantee gold will stay up here with the QT policy. So agreeing to this merger is very very dangerous. You merge in May, gold falls down in June and this is ALO game over.Merging for future cash flow is more risky for investors than taking a loan from a bank to develop AP mine. Now question remains - why ALO management is pursuing merger instead of the loans. This would be a good question to ask them.I believe it is safer to keep AP control, take loans and benefit from $500 cash costs, rather than take on a load of gold in ground that can't be cashed out if gold prices hit $900 and spend half of AP profits on that aside from the 29M cash.",
"Gentlemen, I see a lot of enthusiasm, and little reason. Let's sum all we know about this ""merger"". Let's divide those into 2 categories - known and unknown.What's known for a fact now: 1) ALO profits now. ALO AP project, costs, future cash flow, cash deficit, everything.2) After merger - HALF of those profits are gone to other people, who aren't ALO shareholders now. Merger is an ultimate dilution of ALO shares.3) Rye Patch Gold has debt and it is 57% of ALO cash on hand.4) Rye Patch Gold has low grades of 0.4 g/t5) SF has 0.543 g/t and is running and bringing money in.6) There is a very significant dump of shares on the market. (Why?)What's unknown:1) Rye Patch Gold costs and profits in 4Q2) Rye Patch Gold consolidated audited data for 20183) Rye Patch Gold future real projections We really know nothing about Rye Patch Gold.How do you know they make any money? Is that because they told you so?But they did not go on the record! That's a public company and they did not publish!It is 1 thing to say - and another to say it on record. We have no record. Think about it.Look - you got shares of ALO that needs a little money and ALO is just about to blow that money on Rye Patch Gold - without having any sustained and confirmed operating profits! That is not good. You don't part with money for a promise of a future cash flow that may or may not happen. ALO is not a hedge fund. ALO is a miner. ALO should not buy options like that. This merger really is an option for future cash flow. Spend money now - and maybe make money on it later. If gold falls to $1000 - the money is gone and there is NO MONEY FOR ANA PAULA. Think about it.Now my question is - how do you decide about the merger having the above unknowns?If you had a working business - would you accept a 50% partner based on his unaudited word of how good he was? I would not, sorry. I think some people out there are correct - this doesn't look good and that's why we are seeing such a massive dump of shares. I think you need to reconsider what you think about this proposal. I think this plan is risky - even if you take their word for it. In a worst case scenario - it is a suicide.It would be a very major mistake to vote for it in my opinion. Very unwise.Also - think what they did to ALO shareholders a year ago.They first advertised R/S as a way to increase the buyers group - and then right after shareholders voted for it - they issued 22.5% of the stock at a price lower than market causing the price crash - that we continue to see. Now they are telling us to trust them again and approve their plan.",

Why? The only explanation is the administration needs to create disruption with a trade war to pay off the campaign promises of the president. So the market sells off as there is huge uncertainty on what effect if any the ongoing trade wars will have on the economy at large and company profits.A trade war with China will adversely affect Apple as China is the largest market in mobile computing and the source of manufacturing for the world.

So when is AAPL coming out with a 8” foldable phone?,
I prefer share buyback as dividend need to pay tax!,
"Apple has lots of money that is unlikely to all get efficiently used.  For that reason I would be ok with a special dividend although I know it’s unlikley.  That much money can lead to irresponsible mergers, loose R and D spending, or bloated capital projects (like the new Apple headquarters).Apple could return $10 billion ($2 a share I believe) and it wouldn’t impact their plans at all.  But share holders would be rewarded and the waste potential would decrease a degree.",
"Bill, agree with your assessment. Any price weakness is probably met with share buybacks, and hopefully buyer(s) that quickly took price from 150s back up to 180s was Apple itself, as you suggested (Buffett as well). That being said, I firmly believe that share price stability and increase would be enhanced by a simple doubling of the dividend which would get yield to about 3%. They have the cash to do this, plus do buybacks. I, for one, would be disappointed with the usual 10-11% dividend increase. Investors getting 3% would be less prone to looking for exit price...and if that yield then gets pushed down to 2-2.5% by increasing share price, mission accomplished. Next yr, increase dividend again to 3%. Except for increasing cost of ongoing buybacks, I see no downside and some upside to this...but not a one time special dividend. Bill, what am I missing with this theory?",

Community edition is free and enterprise edition is a fraction of the cost of their DB.  MySQL is ubiquitous at startups and usually competes with less expensive alternatives like MSFT SQL Server.  For nosql key/value store workloads, they recently worked with Datastax to introduce Data Hub Cloud Service (Cassandra as a service) to supplement Event Hub Cloud Service (Apache Kafka as a service) and their upcoming Autonomous NoSQL Cloud Service (Oracle NoSQL as a service ).

"I started my career a long time ago as an Oracle DBA, and have been following the company for a few decades. I have two concerns about Oracle, which have not been mentioned here: First, Oracle does not support smaller companies and just focuses on larger ones. I see this as a major flaw in their strategy. For example, they have priced their entry level database product out of the reach of most of most startups (about $20K) and it is rare to hear about a startup company that chooses Oracle as their database. Compare this to Microsoft that provides SQL Server for free for new startups using the BizSpark program and the myriad of free databases systems in the market. This approach will certainly hurt the company over the long term.The other concern is Oracle support: Comparing it to other support structures, I think it leaves something to be desired.I am not currently bullish on Oracle, although from a professional perspective, I know that their database engine is the best in the market.",

Fast forward 5 years and super-mini computers like the DEC VAX, HP 3000/9000 came along and kicked the crap out of that.  There is no moat here.

"Large enterprises running big apps like SAP on oracle db are pretty much locked in to Oracle due to heavy conversion costs. Oracle is now selling a service that seems to treat on-premise customer installations as if it was a virtual cloud service with Oracle, but retaining the equipment locally.  This is a tremendously complex thing to achieve as each customer's own data center environment is somewhat unique in it's configurations, particularly network.  On the other hand, there is a significant benefit to this approach in that all the data remains within the customer's own physical environment, in physical proximity to all their other data, allowing for faster data transfer between disparate applications, etc.  That local application to local application interaction is best executed within a single data center.",

"The issue (which another contributor wrote an article about earlier) is that it's going to be very difficult to convert their on-premise database revenue (which is a significant part of their on-prem revenue) to cloud. There is really no reason to move to IaaS, most likely you have to win the SaaS business, which makes it really hard. A company may have a ton of Oracle databases that are running apps could get replaced with SaaS solutions, possibly from Oracle, but possibly not. Oracle are innovating in some areas, but Microsoft is doing well because they allowed lift and shift to their cloud. Oracle does as well but they are late to the party and really an also-ran in that business. If you are trying to win the SaaS game, there is a heck of a lot of business for Oracle to lose to others, and a lot to go right just to maintain.I guess for those customers that did lift and shift Oracle to Azure or AWS they are still paying for those licenses, but there is just so much competition in cloud.",

Even we assume that the data at SITC was not that encouraging, the reported data was for then highest dose of 800 mg/day only. The ongoing study with higher doses of 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg daily has not been reported. So the higher doses may generate better results.

"March 19th Vuzi was trading in and around $7.50, now less than $6.....based on fundamental performance I think the prediction of $0.50 and delisting will come to fruition at some point.  But Vuzix has a long history of attracting investors based on forward looking promise.  Back around 2010 they were talking about 2,000 developer kits placed...that was when it was an OTC penny stock before the 1:75 reverse split took the share count down to around 3 million.

"It seems to me that if VUZI was a fraud, every credible institutional investor would have already dumped it.  Institutional holders include Vanguard and Black Rock.  The due diligence that these guys do is extensive and intensive.  Surely they would have tested the devices themselves at each stage of investment, including the most recent rounds and at CES.  They would have talked with customers and prospects to satisfy themselves that VUZIX is viable and on a favorable trajectory.   So if we Longs are operating on blind faith as Richard Pearson suggests then a lot of people with more knowledge than we have are blind as bats and stupid idiots that enjoy losing money.  I.don't.think.so.",
"Amazing to watch the people in this thread absolutely bashing Richard.  Clearly, blind longs who invested on fake news, refuse to see the evidence before them and get belligerent instead of providing any counter-arguments.  I've seen this movie so many times.  The more anger in the chat the more likely the company is a fraud and those who are wed to it like religion or politics are screaming the loudest with the least amount of facts.  No Richard may not be right 100% of the time and your idiotic arguments showing him being wrong here or there do nothing to discount his current argument.  If if the Alexa functionality works is that in any way mind shattering?  Has Amazon not made it childishly easy to use their developer kit to incorporate it in to a toaster if need be? Vuzix has spent about $18 million in R&D in the past 3 years compared to Google's R&D spending on Glass whitch probably run upwards of $100 million+.  Google hires the best, and the brightest and couldn't get Glass to market in a meaninful way, you think a couple of podunks who spent 20% of that R&D up in Rochester have the scecret sauce???

If one wants to argue that only reason the P2 trial was a success was luck of the draw, then one should do the math. Assuming the 428 is a placebo-like drug. What would be the chance of the two ""worst"" patients being randomized both to the placebo arm and the two ""best"" developing patients to the active arm. I am not a gambler, but strikes me as below the 1 in 20 confidence limit!",
"KCM,Interesting series of comments and assumptions with how you've presented your interpretations.  Although it appears that you make a strong case, there are a few assumptions which aren't as solid as you project:One interesting point with the PII data - the one treated patient that saw a significant decrease in their outcomes was also the one who didn't take their antibiotic treatments.  Infections are directly correlated with significant decreases in ppFEV - without that the overall patient group improved by an average of 3.22% points.  The other patients in the placebo group are relatively weak, yes, but as you said - based on the variances seen in regular populations, the larger treated group should have had more variability as well - which they didn't. http://bit.ly/2GgNh60Moving into your mRNA comparisons - there are many issues with your presented argument here.  First - using a paper from 1991 to support the idea that CFTR mRNA is hard to quantify?  Wow.  There are currently methods (now, 27 years later....) which can detect single mRNA copies in a sample (if there are 100 or 1000 cells present then you're easily within range) which include BioRad's ddPCR platform (easiest and most sensitive), almost any decent RT-PCR platform or the Illumina platform (all of which are very accurate).  The improvements in the mRNA levels should have been reported- yes - but your arguments against what has been shown is weak on 2 different counts.  First - disregarding improvements which are presented (100mg) just because the placebo also increased (significantly less) as well as the follow-up analysis which demonstrated that mRNA levels had improved with dosing.  Disregarding these as noisy is naive - as the variations in dosing is the main goal of PI data (not efficacy - not sure why you harped on that so much here).  With the semi-independent study:  The significant improvements when using PTI's compound cannot be disregarded because you don't see enough of them. The improvements reported were significant and well analyzed.  Furthermore, the supplementary data which you lambaste also demonstrated no significant improvement using VX-809 - which you have lauded as a success elsewhere. Finally, comparing the mRNA level changes with this study to the PI study data is uninformed due to the complexities of single samples and small groups.  There is always a need to compare improvements to a background (ie. vector) for each study and determine significance there.  Both studies did this with improvements reported, and both demonstrated significance.  The total difference in mRNA levels isn't directly comparable (although a guide) due to variances in measurement methods and handling and the p-values are not either (aside from establishing significance) with such small studies.  It is important to note that both groups demonstrated improvements in mRNA levels, which were significant (that's the key point).  Larger studies will either support this further or call it into question - but your method of analysis for your argument here is faulty.  Your point with sweat-chloride levels is increasingly supported, however.  So it would be good to see that addressed by the company.  My only caution with that information is that the sweat Cl levels are associated with lung function - they do not necessarily dictate if the lungs can improve without improving sweat Cl levels.http://bit.ly/2pHiqtg",

I am unfortunately long PTI and down on my investment.  I wish this study and article had come out earlier. It would have been a good counter balance to what PTI put out.  I wish PTI success however I am now skeptical. Kerrisdale why not publish your findings much earlier?,

I am impressed by the length of the article and the nice graphics.  I hope they get paid by the word.,
"So here's the thing. Even if the placebo rate of change over 28 days was, let's say for the sake of comparison, -0.5% say, you still have a drug arm that has 20 patients, which had an improvement of 2.5%.So, your task is not to show that the relative improvement over 28 days is much lower than 9.2%, but to show that over a longer time span, let's say 6 months, that +3% improvement (+2.5% vs -0.5%) doesn't turn into 19%.

"This KCM started their short campaign on March 13th... so when it shot up again a few days later started sweating! .. or salivating...Nothing is certain in biotech, not PTI...  not anything ""small"". Anyhow, the data quality minder is not the FDA or the analysts, it's the CF Foundation itself who pick and choose and they get all the data from everyone. Anyone that can beat Vertex combo in most dels is a 15 B stock, only question is does PTI even have a chance...  then do the risk reward. Only question at this stage is, is 428 showing biological activity...Now for KCM it's a different game I imagine. Their ""clients"" likely bought at 6-7, so any cent they get the price below- and get out-  is their profit. Now with this campaign they can get huge volumes and if they get the offering price down enough can cover in the offering.",
"couple of ambulance chaser law firms announced investigation based on this short report.  while I appreciate the info shorts provide,  the timing of all this seems like a coordinated attack to keep the price as low as possible for buyers if the secondary.  the offering price will determine where this is headed",

"I value the FDA’s opinion, not the report.  They granted 3 designations to PT-428 last week",

"This is a professional job.. even proof-read!Cf is an unusual space. The money has been in being long Vertex. There is 14 B of value at risk there and there is a whole industry out to protect it. Then, there are patients... these flows are controlled by the CF foundation networks. Vertex made the CF foundation 100%. PTI crashed when a 10k said they were not being supported. Now the data won TDN support, which guarantees patients... so they can get financing. Hey presto, stock up. And that makes them a risk to Vertex again.So, yes P1 are safety, no data. P2 are bits of data to see if there is a chance of a P3 working. And some other trials have had a steep drop in placebo or sham side: it's the stress of being in a trial.",
I bet after the move today kerrisdale has only a token position left on.  They are in the. Lack on this position and probably have a multiple bagger via put options.  So going forward from here worry about what you are gonna do in PTI vs what the street does.,
FDA approval and orphan drug status are both wrong?,
I only hope PTI performs half as well as Straight Path (STRP) did last year.  Kerrisdale was one of the biggest shorts in that stock before it was bought out in a bidding war.,

"As we get closer to a 5% yield, I become more interested.",
I am forward looking. I think the forward dividend is $3.16 making MO yield 5% at  $61.20. It's very possible that Mo increases the dividend another 16 cents for July and then 20 cents for the October Dividend. At 55 price would be 5.74% yield.  It's almost like the FDA's hand is being guided as to how to hurt tobacco companies the best with an attack on menthol flavor......a lobby group? ......................... when you see the whites of their eyes...........,
I have reached the conclusion that the FDA has decided to allow the sale of IQOS products after reading comments by Gottlieb. I have also concluded that they realize this will be a boost to Altria’s share price as it opens up a new market which may take off improving profitability as it has in Japan. The daily attacks by the FDA first on lowering Nicotine then on banning Menthol are designed to drag the share price down so that positions can be established by those in favor before the big announcement.This is simply my opinion based on nothing more then my four decades in the market and simple logic. Let’s see when the announcement comes from the FDA and what Altria’s share price is 30 days later.,

Nicotine hooks acetylcholine receptors and raises dopamine levels in the brain.  Smokers derive real pleasure from smoking - in addition to what many would describe as ""positive"" effects.  All because of nicotine.  Limiting nicotine just means users - even new users - will have to smoke more cigarettes to achieve the same benefits.  The government must know this - so are the proposed FDA regs just a clandestine plan to drive more cigarette sales and therefore more tax revenue?",

"So let me see if I can summarize the ""logic"" in this article:- ""When something looks too good to be true, it usually is not true."" Profound, really profound. - ""Amazon.com does not make a product. They are a delivery business for the most part which runs a massive computer server farm which is constructed to allow consumers to buy goods on-line and have them delivered."" Actually that is a product. And running a ""massive computer server farm,"" in addition to making me laugh out loud, seriously oversimplifies a business that turned in revenue of $5.11B and a profit of $1.9B in Q4 2017 alone. Heck everyone should get themselves a massive computer server farm since they sound like easy money. - WebVan failed almost 20 years ago so Amazon will likely fail. Okay, may as well all stop trying. - Free cash flow has fallen and that is bad. That's going to happen when you spent $13.7B to acquire Whole Foods for cash. But then again, you now own Whole Foods. - Amazon's not paying a fair price to get 30lbs bags of dog food delivered and 'I talked to this one guy I know and he says it's getting worse.' Solid analysis going on here. A few more data points might help. - Our President, who has no say in the operations of the USPS, and has a history of playing fast and loose with the truth, tweeted out an angry message, therefore Amazon might lose their their deal with the USPS and that would be bad. Based on this logic should Hillary be worried about going to prison? - ""A fully costed delivery model definitely would throw a spanner in the works at Amazon going forward."" So would a large meteor taking out Seattle. And let's be honest, a large meteor hasn't hit Seattle in thousands of years so statistically they are due.The only thing that was left out of the article that is a staple of almost all the other ""Amazon could be doomed"" fluff pieces I have read is the ominous, ""Competition could pick up as <insert competitors name here> isn't going to just sit by and do nothing."" Of course they're not. But it's not like Amazon's going to suddenly decide to take a couple of years off and stop innovating either. What did I miss?",
See amzn at 1000 soon,
"There is little doubt that anytime a government entity becomes involved all logic and profit seeking behavior is out the window.  This may or may not change but obviously AMZN is moving towards their own shipping network.  On a side note I would argue that the USPS hardly even delivers packages in some neighborhoods.  If there is a central mailbox (which is the growing trend) and the package is too large (which it increasingly is) they just keep the package at the post office and make you pick it up.  I waged war against Amazon over this very issue.  If I have to go pick it up it isn't delivered.  Based on this I would argue that the package ""delivery"" costs for the USPS aren't as high as argued because they aren't actually delivering many of them.",
"I think this argument fails to recognize and connect all the dots, such as customer habits, loyalty,and preference for effortless convenience, and the tenuous quality of the Trump administration.  Moreover, other service divisions beyond package processing have become the primary cash cows for Amazon.  The scenario your essay suggests would more likely be a temporary blip than a lasting revaluation.",

If most americans are like us, we hardly receive physical mail - we literally go to our post box every two weeks and then dump most in the bin at the postal service.    We send nothing by physical mail - maybe a courier package twice a year, so pickups are also irrelevant.what % of USPS operating cost is the Amazon contract????",

"The article focuses (wrongly) on the USPS arrangement, and forgets everything else about the company.  And at the end, he has a link to his book in Amazon.com!!!!",
"I guess instead of USPS deliveries Amazon are currently trialing Drone delivery so they could be running their own delivery franchise and then USPS could receive 0 delivery dollars from Amazon deliveries.

Trump is annoyed that Amazon got the Postal business (and yes, it is private) and all he got was a lease on the building!",
"Great article -  but you don't even need to look at the corporate-welfare aspect to see how overvalued Amazon truly is:Amazon's current market capitalization of $750 billion dollars is now equal to the combined market caps of Wal-Mart, Costco, CVS, Walgreens, TJ Maxx, Target, Best Buy, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Kroger, QVC Group, AutoZone, Kohl's, Burlington, Advance Auto Parts, Macy's, Wayfair, Ollie's, Casey's General, Dick's Sporting Goods, Etsy, PriceSmart, JC Penney, Supervalue, and Sears Holding.To give you a perspective of how remarkable this ""equivalence"" is, in 2017 alone this  non-Amazon group of companies generated a combined $40.6 billion of net income on $1.37 trillion in sales through the operation of their 80,799 retail locations globally and the efforts of their 5.339 million employees. For comparison purposes, in 2017 Amazon generated (including AWS revenue) $3.03 billion of net income on $177 billion in sales through the efforts of their 553,000 employees.All else being equal, investors currently believe that $1 of sales generated by Amazon is roughly worth 7.5X more than $1 in sales generated by the list of ""old"" retailers above.Now for some fun with basic math:Let's assume that Amazon will grow it's total net sales (including AWS) by 25% every single year over the next decade, and will achieve a 3% net profit margin, and Amazon's shareprice/market cap will increase (a relatively meager) 6% per year over that timeframe -(keep in mind that starting from $177B in sales, this type of persistent >25% revenue CAGRover the next decade would be the most remarkable feat in the history of mega-capitalization companies, but we will assume Bezos can accomplish it)Using today's valuation as a starting point, if Amazon achieves this unprecedented growth scenario over the next decade, it will still trade at 27X earnings in 2027, which is double the 150-year average the S&P500.For some additional perspective regarding what it would take for Amazon to achieve 25% annualized sales growth for 10-consecutive years starting at $177 billion in sales: Every 12 months, Amazon must add approximately the equivalent of of each of the following company's annualized sales to it's top line revenue, plus duplicate prior year sales from all existing customers: 2018: Delta Airlines (~$44B)2019: Aetna (~$55B) 2020: JP Morgan (~$69B) 2021: Costco (~$87B) 2022: Home Depot (~$109B) 2023: 3M (~$136B) 2024: Proctor & Gamble + McDonald's + Cisco (~$170B) 2025: United Healthcare (~$212B) 2026: Apple (~$265B) 2027: Johnson & Johnson (~$331B) Let that sink in for a second. Said another way, remember earlier where I said Amazon's market cap was now equivalent to those 25 combined retailers? Well, based on the math I've outlined above,  Amazon's 2027 sales of ~$1.3 trillion will need to be the equivalent of those 25 companies current sales combined - you may recall that those companies achieve these current sales using 80,799 retail locations across the globe and employ over 5 million people.That means Amazon will capture all of their sales from retail operations, credit services, memberships, warranty services, walk-in clinics, pharma sales, auto centers, etc.I find this hypothetical outcome nearly impossible to believe - but by paying 250X current earnings a company that already has a $750 billion market cap, this is the exact future that Amazon shareholders are betting on (whether they know it or not). Only time will tell if these shareholders are correct.",
Why do these SA people write about companies they have no positions in?,
"lot of good thoughtful comments, thanks to all...",
"Long AMZN & long Prime- still worth it after all these years, and getting even better.",
"Not all of the items are free of shipping charges.  I wouldn't guess the percentage, but it's noticeable. Plus, I notice many times the ""Prime"" free shipping items are priced higher enough to cover the shipping, especially items that require about $4-$25 shipping fee.  Adding the Prime membership cost into the equation makes the actual cost of free shipping  for the company a good question, but I suspect it isn't as much as one would think at first glance.  I have the Prime membership, $99 per year, and I consider it a good deal, free shipping or not,  considering the free movies, large selection on new and used items, competitive prices, and customer reviews with feedback and product questions available. I own a small amount of the stock, my purchases are usually in the $10-75 range, with occasionally a $100 purchase, and over the years I could average  as many as 35-45 purchases a year. I've only made one return, an there was no problem.",
"Amazon has lots of options on the table, including higher prices. There are many delivery services out there, and Amazon can still negotiate a good price. They may decide not to offer free shipping on heavy items. They have a solid and loyal customer base, which gives them a lot of flexibility in the precise options available to buyers.",

"AMZN to my house (Houston Metro) is only delivered by USPS about 25% of the time.  Most of the time it's a contracted driver.  They drop the package on my front porch, then take a photo of it in front of my house for proof of delivery.  (side note:  3rd party drivers haven't lost a package for me yet.  USPS loses or mis-delivers my mail at least once a month.)  I think AMZN is already way ahead of the curve in developing alternative delivery methods, and we're probably not far from the day that you can ship a package UPS, FedEx, or Amazon.  (Long AMZN)",
I think that's why amazon it's taking place opening in a near future their own delivery company,
"Thank you Daniel...Add to this USPS debacle that AMZN just announced they will compete directly with both of their other facilitators; UPS and FDX.  Discounts and ANY collaborative efforts should disappear, war has been declared! Another datapoint; ask any Sunday delivery driver for AMZN what he/she is paid per delivery...peanuts!  This is a nightmare initiative for AMZN which even AWS won’t be able to hide!",

GReat article thanks,
Such a weak and unscientific argument. AMZN over the next 2 years should double in value and revenue and will from inorganically through further large acquisitions. All of this while causing big retailers to close shop or get much smaller.,
USPS is stupid to enter into such a contract.  Why blame AMZN?,
"Love the company (and my Prime account).  Hate the stock.  It's a 24 year-old company - a bit old to be propped up by investors who do not require the company to generate a profit, while those same investors will punish another retailer for being a few cents off on their EPS.200 to 300+ P/E no longer makes sense for AMZN.  It's time they started paying their actual bills and making actual money.  Wouldn't touch it at current valuations.  It's like Bitcoin at $19K here.",
echo of David Allen on USPS;If USPS(again not government funded but civil service nevertheless.) chooses to deal with any company or individual by any agreement so be it.  Give Amazon credit for getting USPS to adjust costs to a more realistic level!ie;  why have postage stamps increased in price so much over the last ten years?  Don't tell me about cost of operations because just like a government bureau there is far too much waste and it's a culture of seniority not merit((( look at the teacher's federations and the NEA ...I rest my case))),

Hey, Amazon can move the business to FedEx and UPS like they have already done or simply deliver by drone. Maybe it won't matter. One day we can all print what we want with a 3D printer.And most of those packages are not 30lbs of dog food. The USPS is doing its best to use their carriers and save their business now, that letters and bills come on line instead of to your mailbox.

It is an government sanctioned monopoly created by the US constitution, but it no longer receives government funding.Therefore, the whole premise of this article is incorrect.The president doesn't like Jeff Bezos and spouts off about things like this, but he doesn't really have any authority over the contracts the post office negotiates. As for the post office itself, it is operating essentially as an independent business, it struggles with its budget but it is managing to get by, and there is no evidence that the Amazon contract is hurting their finances.BTW, I am not an AMZN shareholder and I agree it is overpriced.

"Fun Trading,I get the impression that ""GG"" doesn't pass your securely solvent going forward, unlike the other 3, but you like the prospect of improving fortunes. The Silver and Base metals being a bonus. One issue that seems overlooked and minimized is the prospect of Gold prices NOT continuing to run upward. Another is that miners have intrinsic human-rights issues deserved or otherwise, especially when operations are in unstable government's in the developing world. These are all non-issues, seemingly, until they become issues. That tends to favor companies with most of their operations in North America and/or having multiple countries in multiple sites. It also makes diversity of minerals important due to the counter-cyclical nature of the Platinum family of metals versus Gold, Silver, and the entire range of base metals. This would seem to favor investing in either BHP Billiton or Rio Tinto for similar reasons one might consider Exxon or Chevron first before going after ""Supporting"" and ""Speculative"" positions. All 4 of the above, look like ""Supporting"" positions with a Multinational Mega-Cap as the foundation for Mining investments. For instance, we are very Energy Overweight to the point of being Overbought. Nevertheless, ~1/5 of our total investments in stocks, are Exxon and about 1/2 of the Energy Sector, not including Large-Cap Multiline utilities, and other Regulated purveyors of Energy, such as Black Hills Corporation, who operates Upstream Coal, Gas, and Oil assets primarily for their 7 State Regulated Electric Utilities as well as Gas. MDU as well, which could be considered a diversified Mining play although its a Regulated utility. In fact, the Material Mining and Fabrication into Finished Construction Materials is larger than their Regulated Utility Segments.My point is this; would one build their mining positions from a combination of these 4? Or would one begin with a Multinational, Diversified mining like Rio Tinto or BHP Billiton, both who pay tangible dividends unlike these 4 mentioned in the article. We don't have any of the aforementioned mining stocks. We had enough aggravation with Freeport McMoRan between 2014-16. Others also.",

I sold NEM (my 'favourite' miner) at about $40 as I thought it fully priced, and GG because it has been a terrible investment to date (look at the 3 or 5 year chart) - I got out at a minimal, if any, profit after a long, desperate and sweaty hold.1. Do you really think that GG will turnaround and finally become a profitable vehicle for investors? History says otherwise - what do you see as the catalyst for this turnaround (apart from the fact I sold)?  Have an atheistic management finally 'found God', or something similar apocalyptic?2. You mention the insurance factor of gold, but as shown by the recent minor sell-off in February, gold/miners can sell off as much as a GE or Tesla in a correction, AND at the same time. This kind-of made me think that perhaps gold/miners is not the insurance against a crash that most people say it is, and may simply tank along with everything else. So when you say it acts as insurance against a crash, you mean against a certain TYPE of crash (ie a crash with a weak dollar and high inflation)? My guess is that the next crash will result from the over inflated stock market bubble due to years of insanely free credit rather than due to a housing crisis etc. etc., so that stock markets may crash by a great amount while 'real-life' global economic activity largely continues. Individual investors will lose massively and perhaps jump out of windows as their 7 billion dollars in assets are reduced to only 3 billion, but sweet shops will continue selling candy as before.

"It isn't all about population growth, it's about investing capital and return on capital.It is great to see JOE finally spending some money rather than sitting around and waiting for buildings to magically grow up from the ground by themselves.  However the company doesn't have the resources to do much more cap ex than they've planned.  They have just over $300M in cash and are inexplicably spending this precious capital on share buybacks rather than investing it in something that will earn money for them.  And they don't have enough buildings or property to borrow against and so won't be able to raise any more money once they spend what they have.  Their only option at that point will be joint ventures, which they have not had a lot of in the past, perhaps because their land isn't really as valuable as they think it is.GOV is a commercial/industrial REIT with a market cap about the same as JOE. JOE has 800k square feet, GOV has 17.5 million. The cost to build out commercial real estate is $100-150 per square foot.

"From your numbers St Joe has spent approximately $259 million from the sale of timberlands for $562 million.  How much of that has gone to stock buybacks?What portion of the 177,000 acres of remaining land is Gulf frontage?Thanks",
Any estimate of the market value (as opposed to book value) of the company's land? It seems like that is the central question if you are trying to value the company.,
insider buys have been flooding in too.,
Berkowitz used JOE cash to buy Sears and Freddie Mac. That is all you need to know.,
"Coach, It is good to read positive remarks about St. Joe (JOE).Over the years St. Joe has had many transformations, from being a part of the Dupont Trust, as a private entity, as a railroad operator (Florida East Coast Rail Road), up to its current definition. My first real exposure to JOE was eating lunch in Bunnell and seeing the FEC trains headed South, filled with tanks and trucks headed to Miami during the Cuban missile crisis.  1962 was many years ago.Have bought and sold JOE several times over the years.  Kept watching JOE.Have also kept a watch on Bruce Berkowitz (Fairholme Fund).  He is a serious long term player and worth following.  When he took a major position in JOE it got my attention.  Some of Berkowitz's other moves with JOE.  Local government zoning and restrictions can strangle business growth.  JOE  mainly operates in Bay and Walton Counties.  Over the years JOE has developed a master plan in coordination with Bay and Walton Counties.  Both Counties have approved JOE's master plan.  Everything out in the open and written down.  JOE's valuable land assets are those holdings close to the Gulf of Mexico.  Further inland JOE owned hundred of thousands of acres of pine forests and farm land which generated a few dollars in revenue and created major distractions.  JOE bundled all this together and found a willing buyer in the Mormon Church.  If this puzzles you, Google ""mormon ranch florida"" and discover the largest cattle ranch in the Country/World ?, located between Disney World and the Space Coast.  Good neighbors.The funds from this sale provided JOE with the internal funds to fund capital projects without raising funds from external sources.  In addition, these funds allowed JOE to reduce the share count from near 100 million, down to 66 million.Transportation.  Panama City had a tiny airport, mostly suitable for small craft, with a single short runway ending at the bay.  JOE had lots of spare land.  JOE put together a joint venture, where JOE would contribute land (which had cost a couple of dollars an acre) right in the middle of JOE's holdings, and other entities would construct what turned into Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport.  And any development around an International Airport would occur on JOE's land.Transportation.  With the widening of the Panama Canal, large container ships from Asia, which previously had to unload on the West Coast and transship by land to the East coast, would be able to enter the Gulf of Mexico and unload in the Southeast.  A port along the Gulf of Mexico, with a railroad headed North, could fan out across the whole Southeast.JOE just so happens to have such a port, Port St. Joe, and has Federal permission to expand and deepen the port.When Berkowitz came into JOE's life, I had been looking for a place to invest some retirement funds and just forget them.  Purchased a few thousand shares of JOE.  Each time JOE takes a step they are laying the foundation for recurring revenue and profits.  Me, my children, and/or my grand children, will be saying thank you Bruce Berkowitz",St. Joe Is Getting Serious About Recurring Revenue

The market in treating oil companies unfairly and and pricing them unreasonably. Look at it this way. sLB is trading almost where it was last summer. Since last summer oil the commodity is up significantly but the oil equities are flat. Irrational and unreasonable. Especially since profits, dividends, FCF and buybacks all increase for these companies when oil prospers. I am not worried and look forward to the remainder of the year for my holding.",

"IMO the controversy is NOT about data and it's not about politics. It's about Facebooks complete lack of caring what is happening with the data or how it's being used.  Now, it could be argued that they shouldn't care or shouldn't be responsible for what people do with it (anymore than we can sue a gunmaker for a mass shooting). That said, even FB has rules about how the data can be used and stored and they are not enforcing their own rules. But there has been a number of these events throughout Facebooks history (the number of events is accelerating recently) and I believe some people, governments and regulators (and media) are simply getting fed up. facebook has been greedy. They do not want to spend the $$$$ it will take to solve these issues. But now they will have to. This is why the stock is down profits will start growing more slowly and margins will compress as FB now has to spend $$$ to combat these issues.

"The Chickens are coming home to roost at Facebook because of Politics.  Read this article from the Daily caller on .Cambridge Analytica / Facebook http://bit.ly/2FUqnB7""However, a former Obama campaign staffer has come forward to claim that Facebook turned a blind eye to the same issue in 2012.Carol Davidsen, former director of Obama for America’s Integration and Media Analytics, reveals the manner the Democratic presidential campaign was freely given access. Furthermore, she openly claims that Facebook gave the Obama campaigners a pass because of their political affiliation.Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing,” Davidsen wrote on Twitter.""""Mark Zuckerberg’s company saw its shares plummet after the news broke that the Trump campaign had utilized Facebook data during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.If Davidsen’s accusation is indeed true, it could prove a serious problem for Facebook. In the case of the Trump campaign, Facebook’s allowance for the misuse of its data was an accidental oversight; as far as the Obama campaign goes, it appears that it was completely intentional.""Now what is troubling is that Facebook knew that this issue with Cambridge Analytica  has been heating up for over 6 or more months and Mark Zuckerberg sold a lot of stock since January 2, 2018 knowing that the stock could tank at any time when the news of this political missile hits the news.   I think that the SEC needs to investigate what did Faceboook, Mark Zuckerberg and others know at the company as he personally manipulated shares by selling ahead of this news hitting the media..",

"Tech giants Google and Facebook are currently purging conservative content from Facebook and YouTube — They are hiding conservative stories on Google — They are shadow-banning conservative news on all social media.In February Facebook launched a new algorithm to ensure that conservative news would not spread on the social media platform.  This was after Facebook announced it was losing 50,000,000 user hours a day in the previous quarter.The algorithm change caused President Donald Trump’s engagement on Facebook posts to plummet a whopping 45%.  In contrast, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders do not appear to have suffered a comparable decline in Facebook engagement.  Top conservative Facebook pages with daily traffic in the millions have seen 75% to 95% drop in traffic.Yesterday, a former Obama campaign official admitted that Facebook allowed the Obama campaign to mine data from the social media giant because “they were on our side.”In a Sunday tweet thread, Carol Davidson, former director of integration and media analytics for Obama for America, said the 2012 campaign led Facebook to “suck out the whole social graph” and target potential voters. They would then use that data to do things like append their email lists.""They came to our office in the days following election recruiting and were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn't have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.""Gee...we would never have surmised that.  I'm just glad I never joined any of these rigged social media platforms.",

"On the FB issue today. Professors could be funded by or request for information from corporations and government agencies to conduct academic research.Most companies allow certain academia access to ""cleaned up"" data (privacy information removed), and/or to conduct survey or collect data. However, these access come with requirements and restrictions.In this situation, the professor breached his agreement/contract with FB to share the survey information with Cambridge Analytics. After this, academia will have a very difficult time obtaining information from any corporations In the longer run, companies (including FB) will start to restrict data access by anyone. This might be a good thing for any big data and software companies, but sad day for the academic community.This will not have serious consequences for FB. Corporations know what is going on.",
"Erich,Thank you for your comments. There are several items that you should further research and consider updating to your analysis. There have been several articles on the internet from CNBC, AP, BBC, Bloomberg....... that have researched this issue. It is of value to read all of these as there is a thorough in depth discussion of what has happened.  There are several key points that should be further researched. (Please note my comments below are based on paraphrasing these articles and are not a legal opinion).1) The GSR app asked and received permission from its users to access their information from the Facebook site. The GSR app mentioned that by gaining this permission, they will be obtaining information about contacts from the parties that gave permission. The GSR app paid the parties that gave permission. Therefore there is probably limited risk with the parties that gave permission between the GSR app and the Facebook's customers, and probably even less risk between Facebook customers and Facebook. The legal risk is whether the disclosures by the GSR app communicated that the Facebook customer's information could be passed on to a third party. If there is no disclosure, the risk could be significant from a privacy perspective.2) The fact that Cambridge Analytica performed services for the Trump Campaign is tangential to this issue. Many of the articles mention this, but only do so in saying that the Trump Campaign was a customer, not that they used this information or were provided information that originally came from the GSR app. (It is remarkable how mentioning Trump gains clicks.)3) The approximate number of customers impacted of 50,000 are located around the world. There has been no communication as to how many are located in the states.  4) Cambridge Analytica had informed Facebook in the past that once they were informed that this information was passed to them in violation of the agreement between GSR and Facebook that they discontinued using any of the information and destroyed it. The reason this issue has surfaced is that a former employee of Cambridge Analytica has come forward and stated that the information was not deleted. The key is that this current situation has not been substantiated by another party. In fact, Cambridge Analytica has formally denied that the information exists and is being used. And there has been no discussion about whether the information was used after Cambridge Analytica was informed of the violation of the agreement. 5) Most of the articles discuss the displeasure with Facebook and Zuckerberg, stating that there should be governmental inquiries and investigations as to what Facebook did wrong and that Zuckerberg does not show up for previous discussions of personal data issues, that he sends Senior Executives and In-house attorneys. Some even go as far as stating that there is disappointment with Zuckerberg that he spends time going around the country talking to customers versus in Washington. (A damned if you do, damned if you don't discussion.)",

Sure FB has disproportionate power and influence (along with Google) over the advertising world.  But that is ultimately up to the companies that spend their dollars with them.  Areas of regulation should focus on two areas:  Protection of constitutional rights and data.  The politics of FB's founder, management and most employees are embarrasingly one-sided and regulation should probably exist to make sure that people opposite FB's politics are protected.  Data protection is the other obvious one in the news today but people should realize that almost every piece of personal info is bought and sold in today's world.",

Companies rely on it. Of course there will be glitches when you have so much data, but 99% of users could not care less or don't even know about it so FB will march on.

FB sucks,
"Snore, snoreeee zzzzzzzzzzz snore. Humpf whaaaa whaaaaa??? Hillary lost the election?? How did that happen?Can someone explain why facebook is in trouble with the media finally?? I saw trumps digital campaign manager Brad Parscale on 60 minutes and other media at least a year ago explaining how he used facebook to target ads using data mining. He targeted very specific people for his ads. What I also remember was a flagrant act of journalism when the reporter asked him didnt the democrats do the same thing?? I seem to remember pascale explaining that he offered the democrats the same thing he did for trumps real estate campaigns that he handled with great success. This included using data to target specific buyers who were the most likely to be interested in a trump property. Pascale would mine data looking for votes. The democrats laughed at him. He then was hired by Trump. So now a year later Facebook is in trouble for helping republicans. The democrats could have done the same thing but chose not to because of ego and hubris. They could just as easily blame the loss on the decision to call back busloads of ""get out the vote"" street activists on their way to Michigan just a week or two before the election. Or on the decision by Hillary to not visit my state of Wisconsin even once. Hillary lost by some 13 or 14 thousand votes.  But I guess its easier to blame facebook. This story will blow over in less than a month. I dont follow Facebook, but this appears to be a classic buying opportunity and the story itself probably is making the facebook site more popular not less as people click to see what all the fuss is about.",

This was kept in secret (poorly kept) until FB bought the land from the development authority and a total of 42 BILLION dollars of bonds were authorized by a Superior Court judge in Morgan County, Ga., one of the counties involved in the development authority.  This is really great for the local economy as it will provide some high paid jobs--just not a lot of them.My concern is why the 42BILL?  That is a heap of money!  The first 5 year plan is to spend 785 Million in the first phase with the remainder over a 20 year period. It just seems improbable to spend so much money on buildings and computers.  Any chance the remainder of the authorized money could be shifted over to another firm, such as Amazon, as it searches for a new HQ?Comments, please.  thanks.",

"No one's name is tied to the data.  Data miners have no interest in individuals.  However, I am angry at FB because they are a threat to our democracy.

Then they allow political data mining group unfettered access to data from 50 million people.  Maybe Facebook is still a good investment, but they are bad for our country and our society.",

We're already seeing it all over outside the US with highly successful competitors gaining market share. As terrible as the weaponization of FB became during the election along with the other tobacco farmer in a t-shirt malfeasance it pales in comparison to how Facebook works with the oppressive Chinese government willingly. That'll be the next brick to fall. This company's cool has run out and the non-dividend paying stock will be dead-money rangebound for years before the inevitable regulation and bankruptcy. For me it can't come fast enough either. Facebook is now an enemy of democracy run by a tobacco farmer in a t-shirt selling peoples civil liberties to the highest foreign and domestic bidders. The tide has changed. Facebook's rules, regulations, advert spam, bans, email spam, suicides, bullying, more advert spam, fake news and lies have made the platform nearly unusable.",

"Gordon,there really isn't any correlation between being a domestic only airline and being more fuel efficient.In fact, LUV generated about half of the revenue as AAL in 2017, flew about half of the revenue passenger miles, but spent about 60% of the amount AAL spent on fuel.  Further, LUV had the highest fuel cost per gallon among US airlines because of bad fuel hedges, costing them about 30 cents per gallon more for a cost of jet fuel than AAL.  There are similar comparisons for DAL and UAL.  LUV is a well-run company but being domestic doesn't give them an advantage with respect for fuel.  In addition, AAL, DAL and UAL all get more revenue per passenger even in the domestic market; LUV works a lot harder to generate a dollar of revenue but is a very efficient airline and does very well being a domestic airline while the big 3 use their international networks to deliver revenue which LUV doesn't have access to.",Southwest Airlines: Best Choice Among Airlines Right Now

This seems like a clear distortion of facts to me....its almost as if your article tries to give the impression that Tesla did bad in the MotorTrend test.  It didn't.  Why didn't you point out that Tesla finished first?  Here's Motor Trends actual glowing review of the Model 3:  ""In broad-brush, the Bolt and Leaf are great cars but leaned-back EVs; they seem pushed onto the stage, hesitant in their groundbreaking roles. The Model 3 leans into the future with a reckless glee you cannot avoid noticing. Its infotainment and autonomous systems are still a work in progress, but new software features are being beamed in seemingly every night. Its Autopilot 2 is crazy ambitious; will it work without lidar? Electric cars are often dismissed for seeming soulless; the Tesla fills the void with human fantasies. You may need to talk yourself into a Bolt or a Leaf; you need to talk yourself out of paying the premium for this Model 3.  Taking all these factors into consideration, our finishing order in this first-ever comparison test of affordable long-range electric vehicles: Tesla Model 3 first, then the Chevrolet Bolt and Nissan Leaf. True, this is a $60,500 Model 3—but some say magic is priceless...."" The author has lost all credibility with me.",

That was just the second group to receive access to purchase a Model 3, after Tesla employees.""If correct, this take rate would be substantially worse than predicted by our July 2017 survey, which had indicated that up to 69% of S/X owners with reservations were likely/very likely to take delivery of their Model 3,"" Sacconaghi wrote.Using Bloomberg's Model 3 tracker, Tesla's disclosures and his own research, Sacconaghi reported Monday that 55% of employee reservation-holders bought the car when offered, while slightly less than 30% of Model S and Model X owners with reservations configured and purchased a Model 3 when offered.Sacconaghi retained a ""market perform"" rating on the stock with a $265 price target, and noted that Tesla has several ""levers to pull"" that could juice the rate at which customers are buying the cars, like releasing the all-wheel drive version or opening up leasing options.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this article.-Jeremy C.

Legal ProceedingTorchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and its subsidiary Torchlight Energy, Inc. has pending in the 429th judicial district court in Collin County, Texas a lawsuit against Husky Ventures, Inc., Charles V. Long, Silverstar of Nevada, Inc., Gastar Exploration Inc., J. Russell Porter, Michael A. Gerlich, and Jerry R. Schuyler that was originally filed in May 2016 (previous defendants April Glidewell, Maximus Exploration, LLC, Atwood Acquisitions,LLC and John M. Selser, Sr have been non-suited without prejudice to re-filing the claims). In the lawsuit, we allege, among other things, that the defendants acted improperly in connection with multiple transactions, and that the defendants misrepresented and omitted material information to us with respect to these transactions. The lawsuit seeks damages arising from 15 different causes of action, including without limitation, violations of the Texas Securities Act, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and tortious interference. The lawsuit also seeks a complete accounting as to how our investment funds were used, including all transfers between and among the defendants. We are seeking the full amount of our damages on $20,000,000 invested. At this time we believe our damages to be in excess of $1,000,000, but the precise amount will be determined in the litigation.  The case is currently set for trial on February 28, 2018.On April 13, 2017, Husky Ventures, Inc. filed in the above lawsuit a counterclaim against Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and its subsidiary Torchlight Energy, Inc., and a third-party petition against John Brda, the Chief Executive Officer of Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc., and Willard McAndrew III, a former officer of Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. (“Husky Counterclaim”). The Husky Counterclaim asserts breach of contract against Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and its subsidiary Torchlight Energy, Inc. and asserts a claim for tortious interference with Husky’s contractual relationship with Torchlight and a claim for conspiracy to tortiously interfere with unspecified Husky business and contractual relationships against Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and its subsidiary Torchlight Energy, Inc., John Brda and Willard McAndrew III. We believe the Husky Counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against it.On May 22, 2017, the Court granted Gastar Exploration, Inc., J. Russell Porter, Michael A. Gerlich, and Jerry R. Schuyler’s (“Gastar Defendants”) motion for summary judgment dismissing all of Torchlight’s claims against the Gastar Defendants with prejudice. The only claim remaining related to the Gastar Defendants is a counterclaim against Torchlight by Gastar Exploration, Inc. for Torchlight’s alleged breach of a release that Gastar Exploration, Inc. claims occurred because Torchlight filed this lawsuit against the Gastar Defendants. Torchlight alleges in its lawsuit that this release is unenforceable against all the Defendants including but not limited to Gastar Defendants.”",
"Maybe if they weren't doing some of these diversifying sweetheart deals with McCabe, they would have the funds to investigate the Orogrande.  Also, it is claimed, that common stock is not being diluted but common stock is being used to fund these acquisitions.  This is dilution.From the 8K:"" On January 30, 2017, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Torchlight Acquisition Corporation, a Texas corporation (“TAC”), entered into and closed an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Plan of Merger with Line Drive Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Line Drive”), under which agreements TAC merged with and into Line Drive and the separate existence of TAC ceased, with Line Drive being the surviving organization and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. Line Drive, which was wholly-owned by Gregory McCabe, our Chairman, owned certain assets and securities, including approximately 40.66% of 12,000 gross acres in the Hazel Project and 521,739 warrants to purchase our common stock (which warrants had been assigned by Mr. McCabe to Line Drive). Under the merger transaction, our shares of common stock of TAC converted into a membership interest of Line Drive, the membership interest in Line Drive held by Mr. McCabe immediately prior to the transaction ceased to exist, and we issued Mr. McCabe 3,301,739 restricted shares of common stock as consideration therefor. Immediately after closing, the 521,739 warrants held by Line Drive were cancelled, which warrants had an exercise price of $1.40 per share and an expiration date of June 9, 2020. A Certificate of Merger for the merger transaction was filed with the Secretary of State of Texas on January 31, 2017. Subsequent to the closing the name of Line Drive Energy, LLC was changed to Torchlight Hazel, LLC.Also on January 30, 2017, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Torchlight Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“TEI”), entered into and closed a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Wolfbone Investments, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Wolfbone”) which is wholly-owned by Gregory McCabe. Under the agreement, TEI acquired certain of Wolfbone’s Hazel Project assets, including its interest in the Flying B Ranch #1 well and the 40 acre unit surrounding the well, for consideration of $415,000, and additionally, Wolfbone caused to be cancelled a total of 2,780,000 warrants to purchase our common stock, including 1,500,000 warrants held by McCabe Petroleum Corporation, an entity owned by Mr. McCabe, and 1,280,000 warrants held by Green Hill Minerals, an entity owned by Mr. McCabe’s son, which warrant cancellations were effected through certain Warrant Cancellation Agreements. The 1,500,000 warrants held by McCabe Petroleum Corporation had an exercise price of $1.00 per share and an expiration date of April 4, 2021. The warrants held by Green Hill Minerals included 100,000 warrants with an exercise price of $1.73 and an expiration date of September 30, 2018 and 1,180,000 warrants with an exercise price of $0.70 and an expiration date of February 15, 2020.Since Mr. McCabe held the controlling interest in both Line Drive and Wolfbone Investments, LLC, the transactions were combined for accounting purposes. The working interest in the Hazel Project was the only asset held by Line Drive. The warrant cancellation was treated in the aggregate as an exercise of the warrants with the transfer of the working interests as the consideration. The Company recorded the transactions as an increase in its investment in the Hazel project working interests of $3,644,431 which is equal to the exercise price of the warrants plus the cash paid to Wolfbone.Upon the closing of the above transactions, the Company’s working interest in the Hazel project increased by 40.66% to a total ownership of 74%.Effective June 1, 2017, the Company acquired an additional 6% working interest from unrelated working interest owners in exchange for 268,656 shares of common stock valued at $373,430, increasing its interest in the Hazel project to 80%.5. RELATED PARTY PAYABLESAs of September 30, 2017, related party payables consisted of accrued and unpaid compensation to one of our executive officers totaling $45,000.During the three months ended September 30, 2017, the Company issued a total of 25,000 shares of common stock in payment of amounts due to a director for serving on the Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors. All of the shares are presently unvested and are subject to vesting at specified future events. The value of the award has been fully recognized in expense according to its terms.During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company issued 58,026 stock options in payment of accounts payable to two directors for 2016 director fees.During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company issued a total of 237,001 shares of common stock in payment of amounts due to a director for 2016 director fees and compensation for serving on the Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors.

"1.  The Orogrande is interesting to me--I love new plays. I would love it work out, but I doubt it will.2. The drop and rise in stock price pretty much correlates to what happened to oil price.  It is not surprising that a relatively risky stock dropped more and rose more than the commodity itself.  This is not necessarily a change in market belief in the management or the assets.3.  The poor results of the verticals along with the JV partner walking away are negatives for the Orogrande.  In addition, the difficulties in getting financing to investigate the prospect more rapidly is troubling.  Basically if experts in the industry ""bought the concept"", they would have been able to get financing for more rapid exploration.  And the JV partner would have wanted to stay involved.4.  The company has had significant turnover in management.5.  The company has disturbing penny stock characteristics (high percentage spend on management, history of failed enterprises by the management, shell company formation literally from an exercise company, presentation at sketchy pump and dump conferences).6.  Several related party transactions that may not be in TRCH interests.[Paradoxically, 3-6 are played by the active stock pumpers as positives!]7.  In addition, the company is involved in too many different tiny ventures.  Very small holdings in many basins.  That is not the way to learn and develop their one interesting asset (Orogrande).8.  $12,000/acre is not a reasonable value for the Orogrande, which is incredibly prospective (no production).P.s.

They may also become a takeover target and in this case it may be good or bad for the shareholders as it is impossible to predict or assess a situation like this.I am a long term investor but hate situations like this because there is no way to reasonably project an outcome with a reasonable probability despite the quality of the management.If I sell and reinvest in a steady Big Pharma Company Like JNJ,LLY or MRK I know at least what I can expect. So my choices are practically reduced to one: SELL!",
Gild holds rights to the revenue stream for filgotinib. Unless the milestone payments start coming close to the acquisition price of Galapagos why buy the whole company? it's cheaper to just share the revenue stream and keep the stake in the company. Gild may also have to replace their HIV revenue stream some day soon so why not keep all that cash for further expansion into other disease areas to offset future losses in sales? They are being smart. Cystic fibrosis is another area that's of interest to Gilead I'd like to see get some attention.,

I do not know that much about technology stock. A little bit background here: UOIP suits 13 largest cable companies for infringement ofits patents. Giant CISCO lost the fight and this company, RPX, a hired gun , claimed a 95%success rate in getting the PTAB (aka Patent Trial Appeal Board, a governing body of all patents trial) to institute trial and 100 % rate of success in trial. You know what, RPX gotknocked out by UOIP, and could not appeal. That means UOIP has a 99% solid patents. VHCwon more than 500 millions from Apple, but VHC patent was invalidated by PTAB and patents of UOIP were validated by PTAB.Cisco and Arris do not get suit but their customers are,at least 13 of them, that is where the money is,okay. The 13 vendors want to get indemnification from CISCO and Arris because they make the hardwares for them. Arris nowfiled the last petitions to PTAB, I think Arris just another one  those of "" ride till the wheels fall off""delay tactic, but at the mean time penalty and interest keep going up. Since big brother Ciscolost the patent fight, I think Arris will end up the same fate anyway.I am long UOIP at $0.0034 a share, I have millions and millions shares. Do no take my words for it. Do some DD this weekend. And also check out iHUB board for more information. Dr. Anthony CATALDO , PHD in economic and finance, has quite a few blogs in Seeking Alpha.His main theory is Risk/Reward. My main goal  as a small investor just like to make a buck. BTW, this whole law suit thing most probably will settle or end soon.

"""Worth The Wait”. Long-term no question. Short-term, technically also yes.

Fcel is well positioned to help build the hydrogen infrastructure. They have partnered with Toyota and the city of Longbeach Ca. to use the city's sewage biogas to generate 1200 kg of hydrogen per day to fuel incoming Toyota fuel cell vehicles (the Mirai). Longbeach is a port of entry for Toyota vehicles. A full tank of hydrogen for the Mirai is 5 kilograms of hydrogen which allows it to go 300 miles. ($16 a kilogram) Other good news is that Ryder Trucking has partnered with Nikola ( a start up company making Fuel cell semi trucks). Ryder intends to install hydrogen fueling stations at their facilities around the country. The Nikola truck can go 1200 miles on a full tank of hydrogen and  that long range will be necessary to get to the few fueling stations that will be available. It's a good plan. Eventually the infrastructure will catch up. Nikola offers 1 million miles of free hydrogen with a lease or purchase of a new truck.Toyota and Kenworth also have hydrogen fuel cell prototypes.http://bit.ly/2G03JHyhttp://bit.ly/2xUw2CNhttp://bit.ly/2FCg58k,

"The preferred, FCELB, seems the safer play and still offers a ton of upside if the firm muddles on through. FCEL could end up massively diluted, but FCELB holders will still get their profit.",
"“Very undervalued”. Yes, indeed and particularly true relative to blue-chips and FANG/FAAMG (imho).There is another big pro for FCEL. Many stocks (also dividend stocks) are now overvalued and may see months of consolidation, if not a major correction.  The market usually does not like uncertainty and there are currently more and more issues discussed (e.g., political turmoil in D.C., FED 4 hikes? / speed of rise of interest rates, bond sell-off, trade war, etc). This is reflected by the increasing number of VIX spikes, which may eventually lead to a healthy pullback of the broader market (I expect for the SP 500 a pullback to the long-term mean that is around 2100-2200 on a logarithmic  scale, which would be roughly another 20% down-turn from current levels over the next months or so).Even if shares of FECL would drop soon by 50% (e.g., back to the lows around May 2017 as a result of missing expectations next ER), such a drop would be likely fully recovered by Q3 or Q4 (given the great outlook and undervaluation), while this may not be the case that fast for the broader market, or currently overvalued stocks.Thus, in my opinion, investing in FECL currently carries a lower risk than investing in most blue-chips, FANG/FAAMG, etc.. And, I could imagine that because of this more and more money will flow over time into the much undervalued fuel cell sector. This might be particularly true for FCEL, as their tech and local market is probably least affected by potential trade wars and other market uncertainties, simply as a lot already depends on LIPA for 2018. Altogether this may even buffer a potential downturn of the share price of FCEL in the short-term. So we may have already seen the bottom now. Time will tell. “It’s a tough one.”My strategy to handle FCEL is building a position now, adding more over time, and occasionally taking some profit during spikes, by buying back in during the typical 50% corrections that usually follow (short squeeze) spikes. But that’s just me. Happy investing.",
"Very undervalued.The LIPA deal is such a huge stepping stone, when all the paper on that is signed you'll see upward movement.Getting the financing to build the whole 40mw LIPA deal, they can always sell off to investors a portion of the three separate project awards later to bring immediate cash back into the business.Once the plants are operational that takes the risk away. These are 20-year, several hundred million dollar generating contracts, especially if and when they sell the plants to investors they work in a service contract for themselves to maintain the plant.So they can retain some in portfolio and also sell some and recycle the money back into the biz.LIPA appears to give them much flexibility for the future.Yes, they've added shares recently up to 81 million float and have some more warrants to work through which will probably up float near 100 million shares, but it will bring in cash, and as it stands 1Q they have $76M in cash, $44M in receivables and $59M in inventory.If the lose $40M this year and $40M in 2019 and then reach breakeven fiscal 2020 with generating portfolio, the cash needs are not beyond what they can handle. And if you considered the $40M line of credit for construction from NRG and if they pair up with project investors, which from the earnings calls sounds like there's great interest, I think they will be fine.Energy market is in the billions, they have many versatile applications and will get their slice of the pie.Easily a $10 stock or billion dollar valuation minimum in five years.",

"Long FCELB because the company is going to need tons of finance which will risk a lot of dilution. Sure it might become a wild multibagger but more likely would need to be bought out by deeper pockets for everything to really work. In that case, FCELB more than doubles and who can say what the buyout price for FCEL would be?",
"Greg, FCEL management has not said they will be profitable when they reach 60MW of generation capacity.  A little simple math shows why.  In fiscal q1 FCEL reported a gross profit on generation revenue of only $283 on 11.2 mw of generation capacity.  If we annualize that and multiple by 5.4 to get to 60mw the gross profit on revenue would be only $6.1 million. Operating losses in fiscal q1 were $7.2 million or $28.8million annualized.  So even if they could hold G&A expenses flat, which were 15.9% of revenue in fiscal q1 (greater than gross margin percentage on generation revenue), they would be well short of profitability.  I recommend you revise your article.",

"When I talked with investor relations a couple months back I was particularly interested in the timeline on the carbon capture. I thought it was noteworthy that an analyst that covers Xom pointed to the progress in the bullish note issued last fall. While the timeline for the Xom project to be completed is still over a year away, he said that there could likely be other pilot announcements similar to the Alabama one prior to its completion and review. I think it’s important to think about when additional test sites could be announced and built w the Xom partnership. To the extent the lab results are validated, there are many 50-300 mw opportunities. That is so large that it stands to reason they will want this proven beyond just one site. So I think there could be merit to thinking additional sites could be catalysts for the shares beyond the pipeline bidding.",

"""CEO Chip Bottone and CFO Mike Bishop lay out a clear path; profits will come from generation revenue""Where's that ""clear path"" provided in the conference call?https://seekingalpha.c...Investors should notice, that the profitability of the generation portfolio will be largely determined by the company's ability to secure cheap financing for these projects.EBITDA profitability doesn't help anything if the ""I"" is all important.Moreover, the author does not provide a valuation model which supports his statement that the shares are undervalued at current levels.The company has virtually doubled its share count in each of the past couple of years so I am not sure how the undervaluation has been determined here.",Fuel Cell Energy - Worth The Wait
"Shell has been in Brasil for more than 100 years, and not 30!",
"""Although the last few years have been tough for the energy giant, Royal Dutch Shell has now started making the right moves, which will reap benefits in near future.""""Merger with BG Group was a game-changer. Although this deal (which finally went through in 2016) was considered to be way too expensive by many industry insiders (because of the low oil price environment of 2016), it became a game-changer for Shell.""RDS ""started making the right moves"" back in 2015, not just now (although I think they continue to do so).The majority thought the outlay to purchase BG was wrong move, wrong time.In only a couple of years, though, RDS has already 'digested' that huge purchase.And their divestiture of $30b of assets, as well as cutting R&D/capital investment to $25-30b was done very quickly.And they are quickly expanding deeply into LNG, in addition to purchasing energy suppliers, as they further diversify their business as a true, all-around energy provider.A cash-cow that was making money with oil <$50/barrel, paying a very safe/covered dividend of more than 6%, executing on all fronts, and standing head-and-shoulders above their competitors?Yeah, I'll take that!",
"I'm 5 years long ShellAgreed. The BG acquisition was the game-changer for a much beleaguered Shell, which is now a major player in nat gas as well as oil. Shell's access to massive quantities of nat gas will become an increasing contributor to revenues as oil (someday) begins its inevitable decline.  Deepwater break-even drilling in the GOM and Brazil has declined to $45/barrel. Shell continues to optimize its balance sheet, and those efforts are continuing--to the benefit of shareholders.Can a CEO make all the difference?...Ben van Buerden was made CEO in 2014. He deserves the credit for Shell's (on-going) turnaround, and if Shell performs as expected, he is very likely to   be recognized as the best of the integrated oil CEOs.In the meantime, trends in the world's oil trade is (and will continue to be) the puppet-master pulling the share price strings of the integrated oils. However, the present supply imbalance is likely to be become neutral by year-end, or soon thereafter. Shell is under-valued (which is not to say it cannot remain so).In years past, and until maybe 6-12 months ago, there were doubts regarding Shell's dividend safety...no more. Nonetheless, with a 6% yield on its dividend (frozen since the payment of June 2014), the BoD has no incentive to increase the dividend at this time. The BoD will instead focus available FCF on share repurchases. Rich-unck:12hrs",
"the author considers it a ""must buy"" but does not own or plan to own any shares. You must really feel strongly about this call. Lol",
I can only wish I would have been buying RDS.B at a much younger age.,
"You cannot beat the dividends.  I am impressed by the Fortune article  February 2018:  ""Shell faces 'lower forever' ""describing its plans for the future. The CEO is pushing Shell into deeper rounds of renewable energy.Offshore wind farms in the North Sea, solar farms in Oman and California, Europe's biggest electric car charging firm. A British electricity provider.   I love it.  I give you 3 guesses who will be among the winners in new energy.",
"RDS makes money. RDS has a world class management team with CEO Ben van Buerden and CFO Jessica Uhl.The move to acquire BG was genius. Now, appeasing the greens in the doubling of the advanced new renewable technologies fund, great too. Lower profits for now, but diversification is usually a good thing and it will pay off for RDS in a variety of ways,Would not hesitate to add more shares as it might approach very low $60’s with Permian scare news,Get on board or get left behind!disc.: long RDS/B",
Love this company & BP;both are forward looking & adapting to the changing markets. Long & buying both.,
Re: RDS.B....Is it consider a foreign company for tax implications e.g. is there any tax withheld like ENB?,
The dividend yield has crept back up to around 6% and I think the dividend is safe. Just holding the stock and reinvesting the dividends will result in a nice increasing cash flow. An investor will do well provided they are willing to ignore the typical market volatility and fluctuations and have a multi year investing span. The management of RDS seems to be doing a great job and I have a lot of confidence in them at this time.,
Just wait until driving season... stock will go back up.,
"If it's such a great story, why has the market trashed this company?  It is down again today, also.  I don't disagree with what the author has to say, but let's face reality, the only thing that counts is market valuation and that is nowhere for this company.  The market is not at all excited about Shell's dramatic story as detailed by the author.  He says it will be at $68 by year end.  Big deal, that is still far below its high of $74 earlier this year.  This company's story is always in the future.  It is too bad for investors that the great news for this company is never present oriented.  It is always about how great it will be in the future, which never arrives.   Yes, people made money in this stock over the last couple of years, myself included, because of a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy when oil was so cheaply priced.  But, that opportunity is gone and now the company is left to flounder about with little potential for further price appreciation in oil.  Investors simply have to be happy to get their 5.5% dividends with no expectation of price appreciation.  Beats CD rates, but that is about all.",Royal Dutch Shell Is Making The Right Moves At The Right Time

"Here's some good news: Parnassus mutual funds bought 5 million shares in February. Vanguard Wellington bought 4 million shares in 4q17. Both are strong stewards of capital.

Is the fractional part given as cash ? Many thanks in advance, I looked it up and could not find the info.",
regarding this statementLook at a chart of Walgreens CVS and cardinal health for last monththe wba/spy pair performance is similar to CVS in that its at all time lows with no sign of reversalthe cah/spy pair bottomed in november of 2017 and appeared to be rebounding but yesterday I was stopped out of long as it appears to have broken the short term uptrend..

"CVS has dropped 25 out of last 32 months. I repeat, months. Why would anyone in their right mind wanna catch this falling grenade?",
"There has to be something going on with the shareholder approvals and some holders moving on, perhaps unwinding an arbitrage or hedge of some kind.  It has been pretty much straight down since the approval on no news.",

"When you assumed CVS would issue 280mm shares, that was to meet a cash target of $21B.  At the time, their share price was $75.  Now, CVS is ~$63/sh.  Wouldn't they now have to sell ~330mm shares?It would be nice if the model incorporated sensitivity to the possibility that integration costs will go over projections (like they often do in very large, tightly integrated deals), and CVS needs to go back to the till for more debt/equity issuance.",
Well done. A lot of work went into this article. I’m expecting the same IRR you are except I’d give a higher exit PE and no synergies (it’s going to cost them more money to implement the strategy)The interest payments on the debt (40bn x .042 = 1.68bn) + dividends for additional shares (280mm x 2 = 560mm) equals $2.24bn/yr. With tax savings of 2bn/yr. Basically they able to buy Aetna for 240mm a year? This is cheap.,
"What are your thoughts on the probability of the deal going ahead?  At today’s AET price of $172.06 less $145 cash and then / 0.8378 gives an effective CVS price of $32.30 should the deal go ahead, this together with the 4.2% interest charge as opposed to the 6.0% modelled suggests a lot higher IRR than 12.5%.",
I have three reasons why they won't realize the synergies they assumed in the deal:1) Omnicare2) Target3) Coram,
"I like CVS. The stores feel modern and clean. I can definitely see a benefit to the Minute Clinics. I also like Aetna and want exposure to insurance without directly investing in a financial company. I think this is a good deal, even if it was a rapid response to Amazon.",

"I made a recent purchase online, probably the first time after browsing 3-4 times. It was a luxury product listed on the designers website at $75, offered by Steinmart on clearance at $28 and then further applying a 20% discount coupon, so all in all my final cost $27 after shipping. These guys and gals do a good job at the treasure searching bargain hunting aspect of shopping. I feel like I got a good deal. I think they have a very loyal female customer base that enjoys this aspect. I think the $3 target is fair. Could still be a ""show me"" story for Q2, Q3. Also some uncertainty how they manage SG&A versus advertising costs, e-commerce growth and further cost reductions etc. Also they need to show the gross margin improvement and stabilizing revenues. Those risks weighed with the story, and FCF puts my target at $3",

I bought this stock at 1.52. How much higher will this possibly go this year. It is already at 2.60.,
"Nice write-up Jeremy!I would point out New York & Co. (NWY) as a possible good comparison for SMRT.  While NWY's balance sheet is much stronger ($91 million in cash & no debt), the company languished for a long time sinking close to $1.00 as sales plummeted and consistent losses were recorded.  Lo and behold the business finally began turning in 2017, with the company returning to modest profitability on steadily improving results, and the stock is now trading in the mid-$3.00 range.  If SMRT can replicate, NWY's operating performance to some degree, I believe your $3.00 target is achievable but in my opinion, will require them exceeding their 1H operating profit targets and then possibly 1-2 more good quarters beyond that to demonstrate to investors that the turnaround is real and sustainable. Probably some fits and starts along the way but hopefully they can just keep grinding it out.",
"Went to a Stein Mart today in the midwest. Place was pretty empty but I saw a dozen or so women / couples looking for clothes. Also saw a decent amount of clearance items in the front, and pretty much every section had 20%+ off signs. So that doesn't give me any confidence on my investment. However, it's still only like 40 degrees out where I live so not exactly spring yet. I would guess non-midwest stores are busier since its nicer out.",
"Jean - Are you talking about CATO? If so, that is kind of what I thought. The clothes look like K-Kmart, Walmart, or JC Penney. In other words, low end junk and low quality. Apparel is now affordable.",
"They have to market to a new generation. Their clientele are all dying off. Their merchandise is from 20 years ago. That company needs to be sold, revamped and please, get a new logo.",
Very interesting idea!This article also highlights that DEST is still cheap after its fall to ±1.3$ and all the way up to 3$ and back to low ±2$...Trades at low Price to Sale and still can improve itself by cutting SG&A as promised few months ago. Still well below the price where it was traded at before the merger was called off,
"Thanks, Jeremy. I just read it. Interesting piece and I agree that it appears dirt cheap.My concerns are that product look like low quality junk (WMTesque). So there is fashion risk and quality risk. Also, I didn't see a lot of discussion as to the operating leases. It looks interesting, but again, I prefer CBK.",
Fair enough. What is CATO? Tell me about their business. I can read financial statements fairly well. Tell me about the future.,
"Maybe. I like CBK at $1 better. On a dip to $1.20 or $1.25, we might buy it back.",
"Interesting article, Jeremy. Thanks for sharing.",
"thank you for the article. The valuation is low however it seems many of these stocks in the industry (apparel stores) are in the dog house at low valuations. I agree with your price target  of $3, which is modest and can happen with any industry and/or continuing company improvement. Quarters 2 and 3 are their trough but even then they should now be EBITDA break even in both quarters with expense reductions and margin improvement. So this cash should last them a while even with higher IE. The earnings release showed a lot of improvement and it reminds me of some retailers at the end of 2008/beginning of 2009. Those stocks took off but granted QE and economic rebound helped a lot. I don't usually focus on price technicals, but its hard to ignore the massive spike in volume. I'm showing 45.8 million shares traded last week on the weekly chart. That is greater than their entire shares outstanding and even higher given that insiders own a significant portion. What does this mean? Has to be short covering. I'm in a semi-modest position at market open, I plan to hold for a while. I don't think this is back the truck up all in, but certainly worth at least a small position.",
"A bit tough to buy after the run with the high amount of shorts in retail as AMZN continues to take market share. I have seen a lot more commercials for Stein Mart of late, possibly increasing their exposure. I am still bearish on their business model. Unless people decide they want to buy stuff in person vs. online - then pick what SMRT has to offer.... they're toast. They quite simply have no moat and once everyone sees they're just doing deep discounts to gain back business - it's over.

With supply appearing out of nowhere traditionally that LME yoyo is now old news. So much of zinc supply is kept on the seas between warehouses that it can pop up out of nowhere. Fundamentals haven't changed though. And Glencore is sitting pretty. As for curbs? The Chinese always have another trick up their sleeves. And the one belt one road is just one part of it. And remember although restrictions can be put on Chinese steel as 85% of this steel is domestically consumed there is not a drastic threat to zinc price from that aspect either.,
Trimmed position recently.  Fearing Zn price decline due to possibilities of demand reduction (cutbacks in Chinese steel production as industrialized markets begin to restrict Chinese imports) and supply increase (new supply from mines undertaking expansion during rally).  Also there was a sudden supply increase in LME warehouses 2 weeks ago which makes one wonder if more such inventory could suddenly appear.  Hope I'm wrong and remaining position in TREVF appreciates.,

Then an additional mill will restart(if it hasn't already) at Rosh Pinah I believe, which should enhance recoveries there, due to a finer grind of material.All of the above lead me to believe that $0.03 per quarter, or $0.12 for 2018 is too conservative.

That said I would not want an oil pipeline in my backyard considering the ample evidence of corporate negligence in inspection and maintenance, so I understand where the opposition comes from.. Natural gas has none of those drawbacks and PEG is partnering on efforts to bring in fracked natgas via pipeline from PA but whether the pipeline is built is uncertain due to opposition.

Apparently the utilities were deemed to be at fault for the fires and are being punished.As an example of incompetence Boston is looking for power since they closed plants with no replacement sources of power. New Hampshire has blocked new supply from Quebec Hydro so they are stuck. If you want to see the ultimate in what can happen just look north to Ontario where an incompetent government managed to double and triple electricity bills.  I would like to see analysts including PUC risk ratings when assesssing utilities. There were a few states where I wouldn't lend a dime to a utility.",
"Laura, thanks for your analysis and thorough research data.  The two halves of my life have been spent in NJ (PEG) and VA (D).  I've held both stocks in DRIPS for 30 years.  Both have been immensely successful over that time as compared to the market generally.  PEG can't miss with a state like NJ --- most densely populated in the country (nearly 10 million ppl), full blown winters & summers, comparatively among the wealthiest/most commercialized states in the country.  A reasonably progressive legislature and public utility regulatory body.  PEG is always a great investment at any price under $50.D currently is ripe.  It's purchase of SCG was not treated well by the markets, although long term, the merger is brilliant, giving D exposure to the entire state of SC (warmer climate/lots of air conditioning/fast growing population/fast growing commercial base with foreign industrial plant investments & expansions).  D has always bettered PEG on dividends & always will.  It is far more expansive in it's long term horizons and much much bigger.  Its entree into LNG exportation at Cove Pt, MD is the only LNG terminal not TX/LA.  As Western Europe weens itself off foolhardy dependence on Russian LNG, U.S. LNG exports from the East Coast will explode.  D owns the only such terminus and is already under discussion to expand the brand new Cove Pt Terminal, and probably build a second.  Guess where?  Charleston/Savannah.  Thus the purchase of SCG (SCANA). D owns & is building the Atlantic Pipeline to serve East Coast LNG exports & transmission.  Buy PEG for stability, slow growth, income.  Buy D for innovation, rapid growth in spurts every 3-5 years, and a dependable 4%+ dividend.",
"Laura, thanks for the write-up on PEG; you pointed out a couple things I was not aware of. I've owned the stock for a couple decades along with EIX and both have proven to be progressive, proactive and good investments using DRIPs, with excellent management - though their stock prices can indeed undergo major fluctuations. I now collect the income as retirement assistance. Not many folks on SA seem to own utilities but buying good ones when the price dips and holding long-term in an IRA is a steady way to build a steady stream of income. However even utilities are no longer buy-and-then-ignore investments due to changes in energy mix, regulation and climate change, and also what happens with interest rates, as you noted. EIX took a hit recently after worries rose about power company liability in the California wildfires, for example. I am curious if you have a generally positive view of utilities long-term, since they are currently out of favor among analysts (along with REITS, which I hold quite a few of). Again thanks for your report.",Public Service Enterprise Group Hits Double With Location Luck And Changing Operations
"I see the same opportunities and advantages for MongoDB and the same problems with turning increasing sales into profits on the bottom line.  However, they are making significant progress as they project a 44% decrease in Operating Loss percentage in 2019.  If they achieve that rate and they have the Deferred Revenues to suggest that it won't be a huge stretch they could easily be profitable in 2020.  That is when they become very exciting, but there is likely to be a lot of volatility in the next year, both up and down.  This is very early days for the company as a public entity so I remain interested, although not yet a shareholder.  The CEO is impressive, having a great handle on the technical side.  The executive team looks strong.  Having worked in many companies in software engineering/IT capacities, I know how many software engineering resources wither/die/leave in corporations while executives spend their time fighting over who is going to control the database.rather than which problems are most urgently in need of engineering resources and how to empower their engineers to solve those problems. So, I am watching MDB closely, but I am also considering investing in MSFT.  MSFT has the financial and market muscle to outlast most upstarts and, of course, they make a lot of money right now.  They are also expensive, but it should be easier to get out if the market suddenly turns ugly.",

Amazon Web Services and Google charge through the nose to use MongoDB (and everything else) on their platforms so I don't really see a big threat coming from that direction. MongoDB is a big part of the move away from the software tech giants and toward open source. It's hard to find where that shows up in the financial numbers.I bought MDB on the day of the IPO but got cold feet and sold it a couple of weeks ago in the run up to the release of 2017 results. I'll get in again after the lock-up period passes (after April 17).The biggest reason I like MongoDB, however, is its software drivers, especially for Node.js. Writing database interface code is a piece of cake, and all your transactions are handled with minimal overhead.

You say the new improved AP 2 is better than it was and better than the old AP 1 and can better handle some situations better than it could, that's good; but is it now Level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, where on that scale is it?  Can it now recognize and avoid an unexpected appearing firetruck parked in its intended trajectory of travel?  An improvement, probably; but something that I would personally buy?  Nope.

"While there is good reason to believe Berkshire may have a very *slight* outperformance over the long-run,I feel more comfortable investing in an S & P 500 index fund for the following reasons:-Dividends-More diversified-Smaller, Faster-growing companies vs Berkshire being too big to grow fast-More Simple and Passive in nature-No risk of a negative reaction upon Warren's departure-Even Warren himself directed his estate to be invested in index funds.  Berkshire Hathaway may be a ""conglomerate of companies,"" perhaps I'll even go as far as a ""conglomerate of mature, stable, dividend-raising companies,"" ......but --- it's still ONE company, thus it's inherently more risky than index funds.S & P 500 is MANY companies, that diversification gives me a peace of mind.",

"There are, alas, a few landmines in this unbroken field of progress.   Wells Fargo is one of BRK largest holdings, recently enveloped in fresh banking scandals with much further to go, not unlike Deutche Bank's troubles.   Coca Cola has seen better days with more and more public-issue pressure on its sugary drinks business, due to the obesity crisis.    Geico Insurance has done very well; yet its cost of capital in a rising rate environment could squeeze margins and slow its advance, not to mention the black swan risk of a major P&C calamity as climate change makes actuarial predictions of future events more uncertain.   BRK has done poorly on IBM, is also showing some anxiety over its Phillips 66 holdings, signaling more uncertainty about its future capital allocation strategy.  Burlington Northern has done well, so long as pipeline expansions have been blocked; yet there are two risks: one a Lac Megantic style accident and the other opening of new pipelines to carry crude oil at far lower costs and environmental risks or accidents than rail.  Large cash holdings are not likely to grow faster than S&P 500 averages, either.   Taken together, these could slow BRK growth to a crawl, below the S&P 500 average for a year or two, maybe longer.",

"Nice article. Can I know where did you get the analyst projections of SKX's margins? Did you have copies of research reports, or is there a portal with details about analyst projections (I only see sales and EPS projections). Thanks",
"This is a very good write up, thanks for posting.    Have you done any work on the likely FX impact to top line growth and margins in 2018 and 2019?   Given SKX's large non-US exposure - i've noted that in past quarter's when the USD was strong that management noted it was a material drag- i'm assuming this year it could be a nice tailwind for them?I don't know either why SKX trades on such a low multiple relative to peers given its much faster growth.  Since Q4 results the stock has actually gone nowhere, although the market has been quite weak and volatile. It might be factors such as:1. Inefficient balance sheet - i know management are just starting to buy back stock, but even with the $150mn buy back the net cash pile is only rising still and is estimated to be $858mn by end 2018 (consensus).   SKX could buy back 10% of the current market cap and still be net cash, and $150mn doesn't make a dent although sends an important signal perhaps.    2. Lack of operating leverage in prior results - given top line growth in the past, the company hasn't really achieved any operating leverage.  Your analysis explains well why this is probably the case, and i also believe SKX has been very smart investing for the long term and building out international distribution and brand recognition.  So as you say, there is a reason for past lack of leverage and why in the next few years we should start to see it come through.  But analysts are remaining cautious on their forecasts and so will the market until there is some evidence of this, i expect.  3. US investors don't appreciate non-US growth as much as US growth.    I don't know for a fact if this is true, but it's my perception from listening to conference calls and attending conferences across a range of companies with good non-US strategies.   As an investor based in Europe, i can tell you that the SKX growth here is very strong and the brand recognition is improving.   Margins on international as you and management reports are higher than in the US, so they should get some positive mix on this growth in future.    But at the moment US investors don't quite understand the long-term huge potential runway companies like SKX have in Europe, Latam, and particularly Asia.  4.  The stock had a big run up from $25 to $40, it needed a breather and Q4 results were an excuse for some profit taking, especially after typically conservative management guidance was given for Q1.   IF management is correct and this time we are going to see an upswing in margins to 12-13% either in 2018 but more likely 2019, and top line growth remains at double digit, then EPS is going to approach $4 in 2019 on some simple back of the envelope calcs.   With evidence of operating leverage in the above example, IMHO we could easily justify an 18-20x P/E multiple on 2019 EPS which would give you a $70+ stock.    Using consensus sales of 5.22bn $ in FY19, @ 12.5% EBIT margin, no interest costs and an effective tax rate of 25%, EPS would be c.$3.75 after adjusting # shares for the $150mn buy back.",

"I wonder if there is any way to estimate what the total demand will be per annum for Canada?  It seems like there will quickly be enough capacity to satisfy recreational and medical demand. For example, if 10% of Canadians (about 3.5 million) will use cannabis at an average rate of 1 gram per week, that would be 3.5 million times 50 grams, or 175 million grams per annum.  If cannabis sells for $4 per gram that would be a total revenue of 700 million dollars per annum.  That doesn't really sound like much when you consider that the market cap for the bigger LPs is around 4 or 5 billion, and there are several dozen LPs.  Of course, all of this is table napkin kind of calculation, and one can alter the values, but I think the basic idea is sound. This suggests that there would need to be scaling up to other countries and products besides flower to increase the revenue to justify the share prices we see.If this is true, it means most companies will not survive and most companies would be going under or being taken over.  Canopy and Aurora, and perhaps a few others (Aphria, e.g.), would be the survivors.  There could be niche companies that do well (e.g. like craft beers). Cannabis would then be like other commodities (tobacco, alcohol).  By this time the growth phase would be slowing considerably and most of the money for investors would be made.  Somedays I am wondering if the fast money has already been made and we are now fighting over scraps, enduring shakeouts due to volatility (good for traders).   We have had some huge rallies (several hundred percent from October through January 18.  How many will a new industry support before things stabilize?So it seems important to know what determines which companies will be winners.   The biggest, best managed, best business plans, first to game, expansion to other countries and branding would be the winners.Just some thoughts.",

"Interesting article. Setting aside my own prejudices, I find it rather convincing.But what I find most convincing is that the trading pattern for Tesla is breaking. That pattern has been buy on expectation and sell on results, and the stock ought to be rising now but is not.The pattern has been produced, as this article lays out, by a consistent company practice of financial engineering coupled with rather clever efforts to focus investor analysis on company-set factors rather than fundamentals. My personal belief is that reality and sheer numbers have overwhelmed that strategy and that May/June is the crush zone. I still don't think that most investors should try shorting, but I have to concede that if one is going to try it, Tesla looks to me as much like a sure thing as one is ever going to get.  As for my prejudices, I believe that most individual investors do better over the long term if they look hard for stocks with strong potential and the fundamentals that support reaching that potential.

"This is a story stock.   Those believing the story will never be swayed by finances and spreadsheets.  The only two things that will sway them is when it becomes evident that the ""story"" of Tesla dominating the EV market and the battery market is a fable.  That time is coming soon.   It is already clear that Tesla will NOT be a major player in the largest EV market in the world, China.  Tesla's inability to broker a Chinese manufacturing facility there has seen Tesla EV market share plummet; Tesla is no longer even in the top 20 of cars sold in China.   Dismal.   The 2nd largest EV market is Europe.   Early 1st quarter signs show Tesla's EV sales in Europe are also plummeting.  If the European trends continue for a quarter or two Tesla will no longer be the top 10 in EV sales in Europe.   At that point, 4Q this year would be my guess, the idea that Tesla will be a dominant EV car manufacturer worldwide will die.   Tesla will be seen as a car maker and brand that can only compete in the US in the luxury markets.  And by then it will be clear that LG, Panasonic, and the Chinese are dominating battery production as they provide the batteries for al those cars in China and Europe which dwarf the U.S. market.   The Tesla story falls apart.  European sales are the key, not M3 production.  Let's not kid anyone, an M3 at $50,000 is a luxury car.   Given the many more EVs sold in Europe than in the U.S. the key is can Telsa sell it's luxury EVs in Europe?  The answer is clearly trending towards NO, but almost no one talks about Tesla's European sales trending down.",

I have been amazed at TSLA shares' resilience. Someone above called it a 'story' stock, my preferred term is 'cult' stock. Sooner or later, the shares will have to be evaluated on their ability to generate earnings, though. I haven't made a study of this, and while I grant TSLA briefly showed earnings in, I believe, '13/14, I can't think very many stocks have achieved TSLA's combination of market cap, cash burn, and debt profile; perhaps some did in the dot com boom days, dunno. In any case, TSLA's senior unsecured bond starts trading below 90, I'll be very interested to see where the shares are trading. Also of interest: when someone like Jonas starts talking in terms of taking profits in TSLA. I understand there are relatively few buy side firms with relatively large TSLA holdings; if true, a sentiment change on TSLA could mean when such a change happens, if it happens, comes hard. Short TSLA via longer-dated bear put spread.Best of luck to all.",
"Great article, thanks for posting t.In the past few days, TSLA dipped below the 200-day EMA intraday, but was pushed back above the line by closing.  Friday (3/16/18), TSLA closed below the 200-day EMA line.  If TSLA opens lower, and stays below that 200-EMA line, it could be the beginning of a bearish move.Disclosure:  short of TSLA via option put positions, and may initiate new positions at any time.",
"Very interesting analysis...  E. Musk has been a great innovator and trend setter.But its business model is wrong (capex, capex, ecc.)And its financial engineering approach will be eventually punished...I am sorry that the ""fall of Tesla"" will partially hit many other outstanding growth companies with excellent business models.... see my portfolio, 25% up in its first four months http://bit.ly/2GehFPj  (obviously no sign of Tesla :-) ...)",
"The shares of TSLA can fall or rise based on hyperbole or lack thereof as Musk desperately tries to do via verbiage.  Musk doesn't dare go anywhere near the Balance Sheet or any other Financial statements because the real story lies there and shows, unequivocally, that TSLA is insolvent.  So, Musk fabricates a future result that seems to placate the Kool-aid drinkers.Previously, any 'burb' out of Musk's mouth moved the shares higher.  Now, it takes several 'burbs' by Musk to keep the shares from falling dramatically.  Even some the cult followers are beginning to ask questions where previously they just drank down whatever their cult leader was saying about the wonderful future that was just around the corner for TSLA.  Now, it's crystal clear that Musk has to draw attention away from the fundamentals of the company.I enjoyed reading this Article.  Some cleverly extrapolated end points technically.  IMO technicals don't matter in TSLA's case now.  The Fundamentals are so dismal that any new avenue to attract money will precipitate due diligence which is very damaging to Musk's ability to snooker new investment dollars, especially when the sums needed are in the Billions of dollars.The game is up for TSLA and Musk.  It's just a matter of time before the company dies, Imo.",

"TSLA is a story stock - when it breaks either direction it is based on news not technical. Musk always has new story - new excuse - new perspective and investors want everything he says to be true so they create promising news out of every bad event. Notice this last week the Bloomberg graph says they may do 2000 cars a month - Not 5000 and now analyst are saying who is counting after all 2000 is good enough right. NO the problem is this generation now runs on feelings in all aspects of its life. Economic and financial outcomes must add up using math. There is no tangible math that would justify paying 5 years value in advance for a stock - particularly when the 5yr forward payment requires perfect execution from a company that cannot execute. This stock will not grow into its current market cap even in 5 yrs and if you place you money on another growth stock you have a much greater upside with far less risk. But back to the fact - then you wont own Tesla - and the TSLA fantasy is something the new MBA wants - they want to believe they can fix global warming, they can change the planet through there actions. It is now a religion. Musk cant - he is not Tony Stark - he tells a story of his vision and he believes his own lies - he did not create a tile GE had a tile long ago. It is in effiencent. He calls panels ugly but Solar City and Tesla still sell panels. He says the care will be self driving as if this is a holly grail . People like to drive their car and don't want to be stuck in a self dirving box going the speed limit - people want freedom, excitement , life and Musk sells something else and Stock will end only when the dream dies for this generation.",

That is the $SCTY merger.

That's also when Tencent was accumulating. So, in addition to the pie-in-the-face quarter, the institutional holders piled in after a disastrous merger.",

For Pioneer it's now an official part of the D&C capex. Pioneer's 2018 D&C capex of 2.6B for 250~270 wells include 260million for SWD wells and tanks. Before as early as Dec. 2014, SWD costs are labeled as ""front end"" loaded. Pioneer claims to cut each well's D&C cost below $8million. Now, it is officially back to $10million now --- in their 2018 latest PPT.",
"Pretty sober and interesting article.  Some critical reactions (doesn't mean all bad, just more interesting to counterpoint):1.  Valuation is not addressed.  Even if capex/revenue is key metric, just having best metric does not say if this is already priced into the stock.  I call this the ""EOG fallacy"".  First commenter makes it explicitly.  What this means is that even if EOG has better wells, finances, etc. that does not mean it is best stock.  If DCF (imagining you could see in the future) for EOG was $100, but the price was at $150, you would not buy it.  Conversely a bad company that is underpriced, may be worth buying.  Consider if you were a used car salesman.  Someone offers you a 2015 Corvette at $100,000.  Someone else offers you a 2015 Dodge Charger at $10,000.  (Assume average mileage, condition, options.)  The Corvette is the better car.  But it is overpriced.  You should buy the Charger and pass on the Corvette.  You will end up turning a future profit reselling the Charger, but not the Corvette.2.  As you mentioned CAPEX is strongly correleated to production growth (much of which results in revenue the year after it is spent).  I think this is so strong a distortion that you can't really use the ratio for valuation.3.  Really, what I see is more a story of WLL spending less money.  Could be because their assets are more drilled up.  Could be because they are more debt encumbered (even to the point of not spending as much money as they SHOULD if they were an independent financer).  Or could be CLR being overaggressive.  But in any case, I do like comparing the ratios of the companies.  Just would not immediately move to implicit value but instead think about what is different in the companies.4.  Also, E&P companies are sort of half operating companies, half bag of assets (not sure the ratio, but assets are much more important than for a typical manufacturer.).  IOW, it is not just the skilled operation of the business that matters for valuation but what assets they own (and realize that assets can be drilled out).  In many cases, it may make most sense to just try to value the company based on its land first and then only afterwards perhaps give some small credit or debit based on skill of current operators.",

Any idea why stock is so down today ?,
"It is true OPKO's stock price is way down off its highs after the BRL purchase. I also think acquiring BRL has provided to be a mistake.  Finally it is true that both of OPKO's main income streams have not grown as quickly as Dr. Frost has predicted.  All of that is the rear view mirror.  The question one should be asking are about the future: ""Can BRL's problems be fixed by the Frost management team?""  ""Can OPKO deliver on its Rayaldee forecast of 50% to 100% QOQ growth in 1Q18?"" and finally, ""Will the 4K Score be more widely used, especially in light of the increasing acknowledgement of its factor of 10 better accuracy by the medical community?""  At the current price all of the past bad performance is priced into the stock and none of the potential. Even if one believes the Frost Management team is not up to the task there is one final question:  ""What is OPKO worth if sold off in pieces?""  IMHO substantial more than $3/share.  So at this level there is very little down side risk and significant upside potential, again IMHO.",

The building in Miami, where OPKO's meetings are held, still has IVAX on large letters at the top.:-)And although OPKO was incorporated on November 1991, Dr. P. Frost has only beeing its CEO, after resigning from his post at TEVA. Its test for cancer of the prostate has not had the expected results, because it has had problems on been covered by medicare and some insurance companies, in spite of the fact that it may prevent unnecessary  prostatic biopsies and possible associated complications.It seems other items on its pipeline like the long acting growth hormone for youngsters and the oxyntomodulin for patients with diabetes or obesity, may have better possibilities.But its main asset is still the connections of its CEO, both in the USA, Israel and other countries, which make possible unexpected more profitable deals in the future. :-)I am waiting for the stock to close above $4 to start buying back some of the stock I sold at higher levels. http://bit.ly/2wfixgQBernard",

Very good article. Congratulations.,
They have been running TV ads in Florida too in recent months.  Reminds me of the beginning of the big run up for Exact Sciences when they started the cologuard  commercials.,
I blame most of the problem on a very poorly run salesforce. I live in CT and recently I have seen many advertisements for 4score on major cable network stations. I don't know if these ads are only run in my area which would be considered the tri-state area or they appear nationwide. At least OPKO seems to be investigating a new sales approach.,
Most investors spend all their time chasing returns. They never succeed and usually end up broke. Dr Frost is a serious long term investor building a big company. This takes time. Just because the stock price isn’t where you want it to be does NOT mean he won’t be successful. The pipeline alone is worth 4x what the market is pricing the entire company at. A bargain if you ask me. As long as Dr Frost continues to have access to capital the clock will move forward towards success.,
soon   opk will be th edarling of wall street   . Nothing stays down forever  and Frost  is clever   and places his money where he eats soooo  count me in ...,
What doesn’t make sense is successful people surround themselves with other smart successful people. You would think that the executives & workers involved with this co would be trying to ensure growth & prosper to secure the future of their jobs. But seems like top execs keep screwing Frost & ripping him off !,
OPK has been a waste of time for investors in recent quarters. Major destruction of shareholder value. Find better areas/companies to investing than this mess.,
I hope this article is right. OPK needs something to go right and help get the ship turned around and headed in the right direction.  Sorry Daddy-Boy I don't see bankruptcy as being a likely option anytime soon. They have plenty of financial backers including Dr.Frost and a large pipeline of products.,
"This data is strong, but will really boil down to a test of the Bioreference sales force. I have won many Sales championships as a Pharma/lab rep, and I can tell you from experience that the data can move the needle,  but it has to be sold.

"Sorry to say but OPK is finished.  Quarter after quarter of posting less than expected results. What's worse, none of their products are having the impact that is expected. The bril buyout should have moved them forward, both in diagnostics and share price. Instead the company has lost almost 80% of its value since the buyout. I keep reading positive articles on OPK but nothing is materializing. Wishful think is one thing but the reality is that this company is headed for bankruptcy and Dr. Frost, who at one time was hailed as an innovator will go out as an elderly, broken  man who has become senile and who will have lost over 3 billion backing this company.",

AI is great for Nvidia but you still need processors and other chips to utilize it properly and AMD has everyone else beat by far by price and quality.  This isn't Apple, Pc's and other things like it (automated cars cell phone tablets etc.) are built with many components by many different companies and I see AMD being the major player in those devices but like I said in bias cause I love AMD wouldn't own an Intel if AMD hadn't of fallen off for so long.",

All of the computers on the TV series were voice activated and used Artificial Intelligence as well. This movie may very well showcase what Technological advances are rapidly approaching and what Sectors will benefit the most from a business standpoint. It would seem the Chip Sector would benefit the most, and that is where my investments and my interests currently lay.

"Data to date indicates Ryzen+ will be close to or at parity with Intel on performance with Threadripper+ following suit later in the year. Gamers will keep moving to Ryzen. With Intel still on 14nm, 2019 will see a rollout of Zen 2 product lines that will SUBSTANTIALLY outperform Intel on manufacturing cost, single and multi-core performance, total number of cores, efficiency and pricing headroom. The server space might move slowly, not so the gaming market, a 20-30% performance edge while using less power will crush Intel sales to gamers. AMD 7nm APUs will do the same in the mobile space - ""You mean I get the highest performing CPU, far better graphics AND 50% more run time for the same price???"" - no vendor can afford to let Intel interfere with that.

If the right new management comes in, retrains the regional/district management and trains the store staff to really care about their customers, you could get multiple times your $2.50.

Copying from other thread.http://bit.ly/2DN232h,
The point I'm making is that the discounted share price for loss of confidence in management for screwing RAD shareholders makes this deal worth not very much at all.  We could see this dive under $10 in the first few days.  I know RAD shareholders will be dumping it.  The question is who will buy it?  Look at how systematically they plotted against RAD shareholders.  Is anyone stupid enough to think they won't be doing the same thing to Newco shareholders?,
"Fyi.  Following was published by Harvard Law about the role of a board of directors in a merger deal. Note that the board can hire outside experts completely independent of Standley to render a fairness opinion.   I am guessing that if shareholders make well reasoned requests of the independent directors of RAD to hire an outside expert, the board may have no choice not to do so.Quoting Harvard Law School below.//////////////////Role of the Board in M&ADuty of care. The duty of care requires that directors be informed and exercise appropriate diligence and good faith as they make business decisions and otherwise fulfill their general oversight responsibilities. When reviewing plans to sell a company unit or to buy or merge with another company, the board must exercise proper oversight of management, especially with respect to issues of strategy and compliance with legal obligations such as mandatory disclosures. Pricing is another important consideration, and boards should be wary of claims of synergy.Duty of loyalty. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in the best interests of the corporation, including in the M&A context. Boards can maintain independence from an M&A transaction by appointing a standing committee of the board composed entirely of independent, non-conflicted directors to review the terms of a particular deal with the help of an independent third party, who can render a fairness opinion. http://bit.ly/2uhvhHl",

"Good luck to anybody who thinks that the GOVERNMENT is going to save them via the FTC, SEC or writing to a congressperson.  That's typically the type of believer who voted for Nancy Pelosi.  Do you fit that mold and really believe the GOVERNMENT is going to help the valuation or legal scheming by Standley????.Standley likely has good legal advice and so does Albertsons, the only chance to get GOVERNMENT action is to find a flaw in the deal or an error in disclosure.  Perhaps Highfileds will squawk about the price.  I doubt that any of the passive funds will vote NO.  They will just take the mergeco shares and rebalance.   Passive ETF's strive to be low cost and do not spend money fighting for shareholder interests.It comes down to the independent directors of RAD and do they let Standley continue to do what he wants.   Perhaps shareholders can write to them and expect fairness.  If there are enough objections that are soundly reasoned ending up with independent directors, just to avoid legal issues down the road, they might request an independent appraisal outside of that done by Citi.   Chances are, if you want to write to somebody, the independent directors might listen.  Government regulators---in my experience--- rarely involve themselves in valuation disputes.

"Author/// Finding P/S for Kroger and halving it to be conservative looks great and all, but consider this. You find Kroger P/S (Marketcap/Total Sales) and multiply Albert-aid Total Sales to find the relative value, right?  What if Kroger and Albert-aid were exactly the same firms (same margins, same growth, same sales, just for a hypothesis) but with Kroger being all equity and Albert-aid 10% equity 90% debt? Since Albert-aid Marketcap is much much smaller compared to Kroger, the P/S * Total Sales valuation will show Albert-aid is super undervalued, which is not true. P/S is honestly a gimmicky valuation measure endorsed by Ken Fisher, who unlike his father, is not really adding real value to the market. Rather than P/S, you should be using EV/Sales, if you insist on using Sales to do relative valuation. If we use EV/Sales to the above hypothesis, the two firms should come out to be the equal value (which should be true since they are essentially the same firm, ever heard of ""Modigliani–Miller theorem?"")I am not gonna do the math, but if you actually use EV/Sales to value Albert-aid, you wouldn't be able to give the ""conservative cushion of 50% discount."" In fact, even if you give 20% discount, Albert-aid looks already overvalued. What I am trying to say is, when the firm capital structure is totally different, using P/S doesn't tell you anything at all.I was a bull on RAD but not Albert-aid for many reasons including what I am saying here. There is really too small of a margin for Albert-aid to actually have any kind of value.

Given a chance to execute the presented restructuring, with a couple of quarters under our belt, we would have seen $2.5 to $2.8.Yes, RAD is now a proxy for the merger, but even as a proxy, the market should be placing a weighted probability and we should be trading at least above $1.8?I am worry about theories proposed that there are two fundamental players: those running for the exit and those accumulating (and averaging down).  So if you joined the party late and have been averaging down, you will be happy with a pop to $2.What would be interesting to know is the average holding price for Vanguard, Oppenheimer, Highfields, Blackrock, Franklin and State Street.  It seems to me they should be making the same call as us: exit bloody or average down.I wonder if there is any average-in price where the deal makes sense and you vote yes?  I for one don’t see it.  As a standalone, they could have worked their balance sheet, gross margin & expense cost structure to the $2.5 per share level.

"What a great time to catch a ride on the Titanic nicely done Standley.Albertsons Reported Decline in Store Sales and Gross Profit Margin in 3rd QuarterAlbertsons’ quarterly results for Q3 were disappointing, with sales and gross profit margins seeing a drop of 1.8% and 26.7%, respectively. Total sales were flat for the quarter compared to the previous year’s sales of $13.6 billion. The company, which employs more than 280,000 employees and owns 2,323 stores under 21 banners across the U.S., has been experiencing losses since 2014. The main reason for this is Albertsons’ debt, taking on more and continuing to deal with the interest.When Albertsons merged with Safeway, the company took on 1,325 stores, which added additional debt of $8.9 billion. For the current fiscal year’s first three quarters, Albertsons reported a net loss of $342.0 million and flat sales of $45.9 billion.Many grocers, including Albertsons, have recently been facing low food prices. And while lower prices are good for consumers, they’re obviously bad for the businesses themselves.  “Since 2016, we have seen unprecedented deflation in the grocery industry — the longest period in 60 years — and deflation typically drives a promotional environment,” said Bob Dimon, Albertsons’ chief financial officer.“The supermarket business is pretty challenging for so many of the big companies.” said Bob Goldin, an analyst with the Chicago firm Pentallect. “And now with Walmart’s resurgence, it doesn’t make it easier.”http://bit.ly/2HJUDPM",
"Rite Aid and Albertsons are both pigs with lipstick on them. Their executives are both busy feeding at the trough getting their slop. The reason Rite Aid is trading at 1.61 is because most investors can see when the merger happens the shareholders are going to be the ones getting slaughtered. Even at these prices there is still plenty of room for this thing to fall, Albertsons  is just bringing on too much debt and their valuation is just a made up pie in the sky number. I'd be willing to bet a last minute change on the deal go from 10->1 to 15->1 Just to screw Rite Aid shareholders a bit harder (which they'll justify because of the current stock price drop). All I can hope is Krogers makes an offer or the FTC steps in before things get worse. It happened with WBA deal don't doubt a last minute change won't happen again.",
As to the options....my latest foray into RAD is very recently at 1.81 a share. I have sold the 2 dollar calls for the Friday after earnings and will do so each quarter (as opposed to the author's JAN 2019 suggestion). I think a solid annual return can be made doing so.,
"Some comments posted here about contacting IR to get more information.  You might not have much luck on this for a couple of reasons relating to ""quiet periods.""One is the traditional practice where a company declares a ""quiet period"" in advance of an earnings release where it will make no contact with analysts or investors.  It's not a well-defined rule, but most companies will go quiet 2 weeks before an earnings release.  RAD is scheduled to release earnings on April 12.   Once the company's general counsel orders a ""quiet period"", the IR department will be muzzled (and not even allowed to take calls from important large shareholders like Krol.)The other type of  ""quiet period"" will apply if there is an IPO which this deal might not be exactly, but probably is for practical purposes when the new mergeco shares are traded.  Not sure when this quiet period will start, but when it does, IR will have to clam up.",

"Trading volume for RAD is and has been extremely high.  This does not mean that 100% of the float has turned over.  I have held onto my shares for an extended period of time and others on Seeking Alpha are also long suffering.  I suspect that there is a proportion of the stock that has not been traded over the past 2 years and a portion that has been traded 100s of times.  I have no way of knowing what those ratios are.  However, if you just purchased your first shares of RAD yesterday, this is still a bad deal.  As I have said before, there is no certainty of value.  There is no one that anyone can accurately estimate what a Albertson's-RAD stock will trade at 9:30 AM on the first day of trading and certainly no way that anyone can guess what it will be trading at 4:30 PM at the end of the first day of trading.It may be logical to try to compare it to KR, but keep in mind that KR actually makes a profit and pays a dividend.  At the same time, retail investors have not exhibited much confidence in KR.  Based off of how KR has dropped in recent weeks, what does anyone expect would happen to Albertson's once it becomes a publicly traded company?  Cerberus knew that the stock would be devastated within the first 6 months of trading and nothing has changed that should change that view.",

"If an attorney takes up the case, I highly recommend that the conversations move to private channels for verified shareholders. There's no benefit to tipping legal strategies to RAD management and Cerberus, who may be lurking these message boards.",
RAD is being looked at with a microscope in SA land but it needs to be looked at in the broader financial media.. I haven't see much discussion in any of the news networks or articles.. It appears to be a blatant disregard of fiduciary duty that should get broader attention. Pressure needs to be put on mgmt.. A change in % in valuation between RAD and ABS should be considered for RAD shareholders..,
"The truth here is that Standley and the BOD, in conjunction with Cerberus, laid a diabolical trap for shareholders.  People were blindsided on this ""sale"" to Albertsons, which they are now calling a merger.  That's the term for this transaction.  Diabolical trap.  Management had to know that this would crash the stock price, just like Standley's deer in the headlights report after the WBA asset sale.",
Standley is a criminal and RAD is a waste of time. Find a better company to invest in than a complete mess like this.  RAD is a piece of garbage and Cerberus doesn't care about RAD shareholders but rather wants to profit off of lame situation.,
If this hack job of a deal goes through and you are shareholder as soon as albertsons starts trading sell your shares and then short through puts ...Albertsons is swimming in debt and has no chance to make it good news is cerberus will be locked up to sell there shares for 6 months ...SHORT the hell out of Albertsons and dump it on them.,
Nice Article HWC....,
"I don't know how ""boilerplate"" this is, but Rite Aid knew that the deal announcement could crash the stock, and put a warning in their possible ""risks"" going forward:   ""the risk that any announcements relating to the proposed transaction could have adverse effects on the market price of the Company's common stock,""What's more, they added a clause to a ""boilerplate"" stand still agreement that essentially sets aside said agreement.  Basically, the agreement says that the ""Investors"" (Cerberus, et. al.) cannot, through any means acquire potential shares in mergeco (parent) that they do not already own.  That is what you would expect in a standstill agreement, right?  But then in the same clause, it says that they can do so if the transaction does not result in the (""new"") ownership of more than 30% of parent (mergeco).  It just so happens that 30% is the amount that Rite Aid shareholders would obtain, meaning that the standstill agreement is meaningless.  Furthermore, a few paragraphs down (1.5) states that these transactions to acquire new positions in parent can occur by buying ""Company"" (Rite Aid) shares.  Fascinating!  So Cerberus can enter the open market and scoop up even cheaper RAD shares pre-merger, completely unaffected by the ""poison pill"" that everyone else would be subject to.  Here is the full filing:  http://bit.ly/2FHLIBHHas anyone else seen such a carveout in a standstill agreement that essentially makes it of no effect?",
"No doubt in my mind that if this succeeds, they will systematically route assets to rob the new shareholders in the form of management fees, etc.  .  Having seen what they've done to RAD shareholders is fair warning to anyone who would purchase Newco shares.  If the deal passes, the stock will drop.   There's a bottom here, for sure.. but it won't be based on calculations of EBITDA, etc.    It will be discounted for the unethical behavior of the CEO and BOD.",
"John Standley should be a case study in ethics on how not to exercise fiduciary duty. I can't fathom that the guy has any pride at all in himself for pulling such a deal on shareholders.   He is the poster child for corporate greed.   When your CEO turns malevolent, confidence is destroyed.  I have absolutely no confidence in this jerk.  Neither will investors in the new company.  This isn't about someone who has created something great.  It's simply about taking advantage of shareholders and stealing their investment.  That said, I don't think it's over yet as far as competing bids.  If I were going to bid for this, I'd be waiting until all the cards were laid on the table.I do look for this to hit $1.50, where I will add.",
Have no fear as Albertson will ruin RAD just as they mismanaged the Lucky Market acquisition. Notice how many Lucky Market closed due to lack of sales when Albertson purchased them.  Look for RAD to close stores and Aldi takes over the leases along with Trader Joes and the 99 Cent stores.   RAD should be a Harvard Case Study How not to operate a Drug Store Chain.,

"On option strategies, I would look at shorter options than Jan 2019, either the July or October options.  It will give  q chance of a quicker exit from the position or allow the selling of another call for a reasonable premium because if price holds at this level, time decay on longer options is not so much.Cerberus has a great incentive to have price hold up for a while as they can't exit from their position until 6 months after IPO of Albertsons. I would want to be out of the position before they are. If I were selling covered calls, [or out of the money pots] I would want expiration before the exit of Cerberus.","The Rite Aid Deal Stinks, But Everyone Knows It (And By Now They've Probably Sold)"

"I'm also wondering why - with a relatively bullish article on their prospects and a very depressed stock price given the potential you cite (4 or 5-fold rise), you own no shares?",
"Good catch on the higher receivables, That's something that can be both good and bad. I see they look like this:1/31/18 A/R: $249 mm1/31/17 A/R: $216 mmA key question on that is always ""what is the QUALITY of those receivables?"" In other words, did they take chances with customers that are riskier than they should have, in an effort to goose sales? For a clue about that, it's instructive to look at DSO (aka Days Sales Outstanding, a measure of the average length of time to collect receivables). The good news is that DSO is actually BETTER this year, 30 days vs 34 days a year ago. So if that number is in fact representative and the A/R doesn't contain any hidden surprises, that's very good news. I'd think that receivables would be pledged to their banks, so they can't really mess around with that. But at any rate, you noted ""more receivables to collect,"" and that can be a double-edged sword. For FGP, it seems to be generally a positive, and simply reflective of their increased sales.",
">> a key buying time could well be when the new lending arrangements are announced. >>I have no idea what you mean by this. Are you saying that, until they announce that they've renegotiated and/or nailed down their bank lines beyond this October, then THAT'S the time to buy? so, in other words, it's too risky until then? If so, then that seems to undercut the premise of your entire argument. And, you realize, of course, that as soon as they announce anything (positive or negative), the price will pretty much immediately change to reflect the news? So, if they do announce a deal with banks, the price will be much HIGHER post announcement than before. You'd prefer to wait until such time, you're saying, despite the likely price rise, because you think it's too risky now, even at a lower price? Just want to clarify.",
"Dear Long PlayerInteresting article. A comment and 2 questions.Comment - I wrote to Ferrell with the following question: ""It looks to me as if total debt, short and long, actually increased from 31 July 2017 to 31 January 2018 by about $100 million. Is this the case?"" Ferrell's answer was: ""Our long term debt decreased by $184,178 during that period. The difference in shorter term debt is primarily due to seasonal fluctuations and the difference between a January snapshot vs. a July snapshot."" I.e. their balance sheet does not yet reflect the debt reductions.Question 1: You say ""Management probably needed to generate about $500 million this year..."" $500 M in what? Distributable cash flow?Question 2: You note ""a key buying time could well be when the new lending arrangements are announced."" I could not agree more.

"Based on EXXI's current Market Cap we are trading at @5 million dollars per 1,000 BOEPD.

Cash flow greatly enhanced with some hedges meaning less and rolling off anyway in 3 months and the rest of the horrible hedges at $50 in 9 months.If we valued our smaller competitors on our enterprise value its about 1.5 million per 1,000 BOEPD. EXXI has the infrastructure to handle the oil without increasing costs.",
EXXI has seen its daily production fall from 43K/day in qtr3 2016 to 27K/day 4th Qtr 2017. The production decline has been breathtaking. Will Qtr1 2018 be the low water mark in production? Returning to traditional production volumes in a rising price environment with cost controls is a recipe for substantial stock price appreciation from $4/share.,
"Don’t we have to check what changed what caused the cash flow drop? I am not at home now so can’t check, but i suspect plug and abandonment was really high or something like that? Maintenance? Likely some 1-time negative effects going on. Production volume is down a bit and sale price up a bit. Less cash flow can’t be because much lower revenues, so it is in the costs part of the result here.",

They have a filing from 2 days back with SEC explaining late filing of 10-K.  In detail it states that due to poor controls they UNDERstated their plugging and abandonment obligations- but not sure by how much.  I’m a higher priced oil scenario EXXI could pay off handsomely- given low debt and low equity value.  I previously calculated their all in sustaining cost at ~$51 per BOE which is high but manageable at realises prices of $60 or greater - one issue is they hedged >25% of 2018 production at ~$50.  That said if one is an oil bill this has high return potential - additional debt and/or equity dilution via more share issuance are risks.  GLTA,
Last quarter was bad. 4kboed was reduced becoz of hurrican. bad hedging as well. I think all bad news are priced in. common this is a company produing 28kboed and market is just 150M with no net debt. huge reserve. i think consolidation is GOM will happen. previous management left too much mess. i think this management is  good and sincere. they are targeting 2019 exit production of 36kboed which is mouthwatering.,
But this is a company that primarily focuses on enhancing production in existing fields so the likelihood of a new ‘gusher’ is slim,

One thing you need to look at in your analysis of Zscaler is the SD-WAN market.

Now look at NVCR on a multiyear chart. It is currently in an uptrend that began in April 2017. Yes, it is moving sideways now (building a flag? consolidating?). It pulled back from its most recent high that was formed in January. Will it move back up and breakthrough it? Well, the fundamental growth of NVCR is excellent, given the growth of prescriptions, remarkable 5-year survival rates for cancer patients, accelerating revenues, several FDA trials that very likely will lead to further indications, third-party payer approval growth, and possible international expansion. Everything about NVCR suggest that it has the potential to explode to the upside in 2018.  So why sell if it dips 5%? Bad decision for fundamental investors. Your no BS plan is BS. It's not based on fundamentals nor technical analysis, but sheer whimsy. Sorry, last week I didn't write when you asked for comments about your methods.

Even just doing this can lead to getting terribly hurt by either 1) bad stock picking, or 2) if the market turns south for an extended period.

I absolutely buy into the the gross margin potential here.  Look at a company like GRUB.  50% gross margin and they don't charge their customers (users) anything.

It will be a long slog for this company to ever reward me in terms of a profit and certainly from the “lost opportunity cost” of the money tied up in it. But I knew that when I bought it. The costs are so high in development and the approvals so difficult to obtain that it is always a gamble. And as Longimgn points out above, its pretty random who can stay afloat long enough to get those elusive approvals even with a promising product.I usually check its price once a year and I do pay attention to anything in the news.I have time and as Warren says” Its not timing the market, its time in the market”.My only other investment in this field is AKAO, Achaogen.

ZS was weak the first 3 hours of trading, but then broke through the $28 first minute high.  When that happened, momentum traders jumped in and took it to a closing price of $33.00.

The fact that they strongly lowered new store openings shows concern that the merchandising strategy isnt working. Its the right approach but likely means 2018 will be a reset.

"The TSLA haters are getting more desperate and shrill. They are being paid to do so. There are two major industry groups being disrupted. The automotive industry and the petrochemical industry.

It is inherently inefficient compared to the TESLA direct internet sales model which does not require either franchises or big repair facilities. The electric car car is inherently simpler and needs few repairs. The ICE industry unlike the EV industry requires extensive repair facilities for engines, transmissions, radiators, fuel pumps, exhaust systems, etc.As TESLA ramps its production ( now about 2500 per week) to 5000 per week by the end of this quarter , the company will be able to cut its losses.In Q3 and Q4 even with a run rate of 5000 per week , Tesla will be generating significant profits and the cash on hand will grow.

"Besides BYD and Tesla, does anyone know of any world class EV pure breeds around the world?  I am pretty sure it's just these two.   BAIC spun off its EV business but it is not world class as its in China only.",
capital raise seems inevitable. I don't own TSLA but I will buy some if they manage to raise 10B. Wouldn't touch it if they do something like 1.5B because that will mean they have to raise capital again in the near future.,
"Dear shareholder, you stood by us and you invested, when all those naysayers out there, all those oil burners, speculated against Tesla and a better future for us all.While the share price has been your reward all in itself, and you no doubt take great satisfaction in seeing Tesla prosper, we feel it is our turn now to express our gratitude.We would like to offer to you 10 new shares of Tesla for every 100 you own today. The special discount to you as a long time supporter will be that you only have to pay for eight shares (at the clsoing price at NY SX as of today), while two shares will be our gift to you.We are extremely confident that this offer of two free shares for every eight you buy in this unique opportunity will strengthen our relationsship, will accelerate the growth of Tesla towards new models, and it will leave all those naysayers envious and speechless.Let's build a better future together! Sincerely yours, EM",
"Tesla needs to stay above water through the 2020 election.  Assuming a Democrat replaces Trump, than they can expect assistance via regulations or other actions.  Tesla is huge in the neoliberal California Democrat community.  This is why Musk is actually important.  They need a showman not a business venture.",
Everybody is expecting it so Elon would be crazy not to do it. If he is smart hed go for 10 Bn at least.,
"Lots of new cars arrived in Germany. These ready to deliver cars (new) are offered with 10,000-17,000 $ discount against self configured cars.Yes, they are giving discounts, because they are production constrained (???).This ""production constrained"" talk is utter nonsense.",
I think it is correct to assume that Tesla needs much much more money until 2020 than the 3-5 bn discussed here. The best solution for Tesla would be entering a partnership with a big player with deep pockets. But ironically the totally overvalued share price stands in Tesla‘s way...But this problem may be solved soon...A white knight would require two things:- a much lower share price- EM out of town and not coming back.,
"Montana - Thank you as always for the excellent article.  I see that the biggest problem with a Q3 equity raise is that by then 2019 will be looming large.  Anyone considering funding losses/capital requirements for 2018 would surely recoil in horror when considering the cash requirements to get through 2019:- 2019 debt service.  (As I recall, much more onerous than 2018).  Interest could be running at $1B per year by then.- Supplier payments for M3 ‘ramp’.  TSLA will be facing the full brunt of inventory orders for 10,000 per week, with production and orders still likely well below a third of that.- The GF2 problem will be unable to be ignored by then.  Big obligations looming there.- New factory Cap Ex.  There is no hope they can make any more than the MS/X/3 in Fremont so if they even want to suggest new products, they would have to be talking about big money and long term plans.So, my guess is that Q3 is just too late.  Wouldn’t they need to raise more like $7B to deal with the issues above for 18 months?  Even Muskie can’t talk his way out of those problems.",
"Here's a gem from the latest puff piece from Consumer Edge (Who?) titled ""Tesla could be falling short of key Model 3 goal, but who’s counting""""The Silicon Valley car maker kept mum on a Model 3 reservation count, a number it hasn’t updated since August, when it said it had 455,000 reservations. Tesla believes in pent-up demand for the Model 3 that cannot be seen through changes in reservations, Consumer Edge said.""Translation = reservations are plummeting....",

Once that pool is depleted, will there be enough demand to make the Model 3 a success? Sedans are not what customers are buying in mass.",

Tesla or The Adventures of Baron Muskhausen.....,
"There’s about a dime’s worth of difference between Trump and Musk right about now in that they’re both headed for oblivion.They both are supported by a devoted group of converts who are more than happy to parrot any message delivered. They both serve as figureheads for their organizations; the Republican Party and Tesla, respectively. The fan base follows the figures first and then, by extension, the organization.Their supporters are all staunch users of “whataboutism.” Bring up Trump’s failings and the response is typically “Hilary’s emails” or “Obama.” Bring up Musk’s failings and the response is typically “Big oil” or “climate change” (which is undeniably real, but an awful argument to support a business). They’re bleeding from their executive suite/cabinet. Trump can’t hold onto anyone in his cabinet and anybody with a “finance” title seems to be jumping ship at Tesla.They both make extensive use of Twitter to employ deception, spin, and obfuscation. Their agendas are spelled out in Tweet form.They both have superficial successes to point at. Trump can cite the Republican committee’s conclusion that he didn’t collude with Russia (although it’s Mueller who matters). Musk can point to the stock price (although it’s fundamentals that matter).Time is running out for both. Trump and his people are getting subpoenaed left and right. Musk knows a capital raise is needed, but there may not be a market for it.And lastly, they could both probably use more oversight, with the FBI and SEC respectively. It’s funny; since they’re on opposite sides of the political spectrum, most people will root for one and boo the other. But remove politics and just examine their charlatanism, and you’ll see the same person, just photocopied to a different office.",
"it's important to remember that Tesla has around $1.5 bn. to $2 bn. that it owes on equipment already purchased. As a result, I expect to see a cash payment of $1 bn. or more for capex in Q1 alone.  Also keep in mind that we only see cash at quarter end. I wonder what the balance was at  Feb. 28, and more importantly what it will be at May 31. With sales so heavily weighted toward the third month of each quarter, cash must dip substantially during the quarter before recovering a bit at the end.  One minor point; the first cash interest payment of about $45 million for the August  $1.8 bn. debt issue was due this quarter. Payment is only every six months. (but interest expense is accrued each quarter.)I expect to see Tesla's cash balance decrease by $1 bn. to  $1.5 bn. this quarter.",
"MS, what do you think are the chances of Tesla being able to raise cash by selling more shares?  I keep hearing that selling more shares is unlikely because they don't want the SEC scrutiny, but I would like to hear your opinion.",
"If TSLA tries to go on this year WITHOUT an attempt to raise a few Billions; after I stop laughing, I'll be adding to my Short positions BIG TIME.Anyone that says that the Model 3 production will obviate the need to raise additional capital has to either be kidding, hallucinating, or likes to see what it takes for the investing public to raise the short position in TSLA over 50%.Without a whole lot more funding; the last thing Musk can say is:  ""Will the last person leaving the Factory, turn out the lights?""",
""" support cannot be had unless Tesla first accomplishes two things:First, meets its near-term Model 3 guidance (2,500 per week by March 31; 5,000 per week by June 30); andSecond, shows it has cleaned up most of the problems now plaguing many of the Model 3 production cars.I doubt Tesla can do either.""Well I think they can.This ""short article"" is one of many that are churned out every day on SA. Some have validity, ( like this one ) others don't. As the production rises, yes the losses go down and the tipping point will be reached. That tipping point will be that TSLA is GAAP profitable. Now as far as capital raise is  concerned..... it may come, it may not. Depending on how much GAAP profitable TSLA is, the necessary funds to build another plant or to simply expand the Gigafactory may come from profits alone. Right now there are no profits, but to get profits, production of the Model 3 will have to get to 5,000 units week. If they get there before asking for a capital raise, you could be looking at a short squeeze. I think the big boys want another short squeeze, before they lend more money to expand to make the Model Y and the Semi.Lot of ifs ands and buts. I am a small investor and yes people ignore me. My comment is meant to say that Montana Skeptic does not believe 5k a week is possible this year. I do.We'll see! Cheers!",
"There is a lot of doubt expressed here that Wall Street will be reluctant to drum up a huge capital raise for Tesla. I worked on Wall Street, and met way too many investment bankers who would sell almost anything for a commission, no matter how dodgy the deal.Tesla is a company with a $57 billion market cap and top-tier  money managers like T. Rowe Price have been buying shares by the bucketful in the last 6 months. The fees and commissions from a $5 billion stock sale are enough for investment bankers to acquire a bigger manse in the Hamptons. I say a deal gets done even with all the red flags being waved by Montana Skeptic, Cover Drive, Anton and other Seeking Alpha analysts.A number of people have opined in Seeking Alpha that it's too soon to short Tesla. Although I am short now, I would not be surprised to see Tesla pull off a stock sale of at least $3 billion within two months, and keep the stock price levitated for another six months. At some point it will become glaringly obvious that Model 3 margins will never reach Musk expectations; sales of Model 3's are lackluster; Model 3's continue to have major quality issues; and the Semi never materializes. The biggest nail in the Tesla coffin is coming from competition. Ford, VW, and other major manufacturers gearing up full EV lines have 10, 20 or more dealerships in most states and massive marketing budgets. Tesla has two or three mall showrooms in many states and perhaps one or two service centers, plus no marketing budget at all. Buyers want convenience, and when the choice is either an EV with a service center less than an hour away or a Tesla with a service center three hours away, Tesla loses.Tesla needs to raise money urgently, but I think Wall Street's hunger for fees and commissions will outweigh red flags from due diligence.",
"$5 billion may not be enough.  According to Bosch, to build world class battery cells, one needs $20 billion.With this in mind, BYD market cap is only $28billion vs Tesla’s $60billion.  It’s battery operation is worth $20billion which means you can buy a profitable EV, storage company for $8billion.  Vs.. a Tesla @ $60 billion.    All these headache with manufacturing  problems, Capital raises.  I just don’t understand why Tesla shareholders wouldn’t dump expensive Tesla shares and just buy BYD.",
"it should be ""they, not I"", I believe.  So capital raise and THEN s&p 500?",
"I really have to marvel at the fact that the human race has been able to devise things like heat, air conditioning, plumbing, sanitation. I just watched the video that Ms links to in the article of the guy who bought the model 3 and has posted the video with all the problems. and in the video he mentions a couple times he also owns a model S. at one point he acknowledged that some model S bugs took YEARS YES YEARS according to him to resolve. but he went ahead and bought another car from the same company. and this man probably is in the highest wage earners and most highly educated people in the most prosperous place on Earth. and he decides to buy a second Tesla after that experience. and this being the entitled States of America, posts videos on YouTube of his problems.how the heck did we figure out which end of the cave was the way out?",

"Any source of money company/institution that is approached with an offer/request to provide billions of dollars to TSLA will certainly do their own due diligence.It's my belief that any sophisticated investor that does his/her/its due diligence would be more inclined to short TSLA rather than pour money into Musk's pipe dreams.  Why?  Because TSLA is so far from solvency that NEW MONEY will be pumped down the rat hole.  15 years in business and the concept of profit, in this 'for' profit company is farther away now than it was 15 years ago.  Net Operating Cash Flow alone is at such a negative level nobody in their right mind would want to sink more money into the company now known as The Titanic, formerly called Tesla.I'm anxious to see how TSLA raises $3B or more which will be used to delay the final death knell of this Company.  There is no possibility that Musk can resurrect TSLA, from the current financial condition which is dismal or worse.Even Musk's hallucinating about TSLA's future won't overcome any reasonable degree of Due Diligence.  I'm not a Mutual Fund investor but, if I was and my MF gave Musk money now; I'd cash in my shares and move on immediately.",
What is the basis for thinking that they can’t raise 3 billion without those two performance milestones?  I see no citations.,
"<Seems like a narrow window.>The window isn't really open without a CAO or Treasurer to sign the assurances which an underwriter will require prior to a pimp and dump. I suppose Tesla could promote an AP clerk for the purpose but the SEC has made its sentiments regarding unverified claims regarding innovative disruption very clear. Given Tesla has never demonstrated the capability of achieving either,  underwriters may want to hold off until next year on the chance a miracle occurs. Tesla certainly won't be any more dead next year than it is today.",
"@Montana, Here's another wrench to throw into things. Moody's will re-examine the 2017 issuance of Tesla bonds, and it will do so by the first week of August 2018.""Pursuant to Provision 1.9 of the MIS Code, with the exception of those credit ratings which are clearly identified as point-in-time ratings, once a credit rating has been published MIS will monitor that credit rating, as deemed appropriate, on an ongoing basis and will modify the credit rating as necessary in response to changes in our opinion of the creditworthiness of the Issuer or issue. All monitored credit ratings are reviewed at least once every twelve months, with the exception of Sovereign credit ratings, which are reviewed at least every six months.""If Moody's re-examines, and downgrades, before Tesla issues the equity, does this not threaten the viability of the capital raise? That appears to be a possibility, especially since a condition of retaining the current rating is progress on model 3 production/deliveries. Tesla may be in a race to re-adjust model 3 ramp expectations and raise equity before Moody's re-rates. A question for you is: would the secondary buyers ask Moody's to re-examine the bonds before they buy more equity?And another question for you. Earlier in this comment thread you said that:""Tesla will need to revise its production guidance before it can raise capital. If it does that when it makes its delivery announcement in April, I would expect a capital raise soon thereafter.""Do you think that Tesla can raise capital after the deliveries numbers come out, but before the Q1 results come out? Seems like a narrow window.",
"MS,For people with  manufacturing background, ""cold build"" made it clear where this ramp was going. Daily Kanban or someone else revealed this was cold build early last year if memory serves me right.This is part of the reason that I have been predicting no real ""production"" until Q3 2018 or may be until sometime in 2019.Nevertheless, good find on the vendor source. I was surprised that a vendor source commenting on this so clearly.I clicked the links and see that those comments are missing and the user is gone. Probably validates that was fairly accurate.

"Nice summary Montana. I must confess I am really surprised they didn't raise money in Q1. I can only imagine it is going to get harder in the coming quarters. If and when they are able to raise production levels of the Model 3 to some degree, the questions will shift to profitability. It is also very interesting that Morgan Stanley has changed their tune from 'buy the dips' to 'sell the rips' on Tesla. Surely there is no way they will be able to underwrite a raise now, is there? (Yeah, I know chinese wall and stuff but at the end of the day, they will have to convince their investors why their own equity research division is wrong in its assessment)",
"Where are the credit ratings in all this?  Tesla has an Altman Z score of 1.27.  The ratings agencies gave Tesla the rating they did because of Tesla's equity market cap and the idea that they could sell stock to pay off debt.  I have never seen the ratings agencies give a company such a credit rating based on its skill as a Ponzi scheme.  Time for a massive downgrade.  Once that happens, suppliers would be smart to tighten terms.",
The creation of the Dolchstoßlegende is the next really interesting part. 200K stranded Tesla owners are going to demand a satisfying sinister fantasy to explain why the brick sits in their driveway. Looking at a mirror or a picture of Elon just won't be enough for them.,

"montana:  be careful not to double count contracted obligations, they have tombe partnof future opex or capex.   So if you predict next 12 month opex and capex then you can only really also add contract obligations if they are closer to the class of take or pays that are in excess of actual operations.I may not explain well:   Say one of the contractual obligations is to buy 250,000 windscreens in 2019.   If you are forecasting revenue and cogs for 2019 using 150,000 cars then 150k of those 250k obligations are already in your numbers.    The other 100k should be added to extent they are irrevovable - most offtake could carry a price per windscreen that the customer can pay to not take delivery.Exact same can be on capex.But on your forecast you are IMO 1.5b too liberal on cashflow from operations.

"@MontanaI have a nagging suspicion that this ""production hell"" was entirely planned for from the very beginning.They knew very well that the ship is sinking. S and X sales were at best static, even with heavy discounting. It was a matter of time before the story unraveled. The Model 3 would kick the can down the street for a while, but there was no time or money to do the 2-3 year long testing process that is typical in the car industry for new models.And they never had the capability of producing 5 to 10 thousand per week. There were several indications on that, eg this Montana Skeptic article: https://seekingalpha.c...or the Daily Kanban article on the paint shop permits.So no testing and no production capability. Because all they really needed was just a trickle of badly klutzed together cars to keep the story going for a little while longer.Looks like they are intentionally steering the ship towards the iceberg.And about Musk's tweet on being in the 8th circle of hell (fraud).

The battery pack on thisvehicle was suspended underneath the carriagework,and was removed and replaced with a fresh unit using alateral trolley system. Battery packs were charged offthe vehicles, and scheduled for recharging in such a wayas to optimally utilize the output of the coal-firedgenerators which provided the electric power for thefacility. A similar vehicle configuration and facility wasdeveloped a few years earlier in 1896, by the Morris andSalom Company, servicing a somewhat smaller taxi fleetin New York City""",

Thanks to you and your collaborators (such as CoverDrive) for this badly needed information.Many here don't deal with technical analysis, but one thing happened today (3/16/2018) that I'd like to point out:  In the past few days, TSLA stock dipped below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) *five* times, but closed above the 200-day EMA each time.  Today, it closed below the 200-day EMA.  This could be important, as algorithms often use the 200-day EMA for buying and selling.

"As always, great work Montana. It would be nice to be able to see a kind of quarterly waterfall. Something is not right in teslaville. If we break down that capex, the purchase obligations, projected losses and payables (stacked up from Q4 2017), I think the situation may be even more dire than you paint. My ignorance of what Tesla is doing day to day to meet obligations keeps me from more than a back of the envelope quess. If that bottom line loss number is closer to $1 billion, and you add +25% of the capex at $800 million, plus 25% of the purchase obligations at $700 million or so and if they have to pony up for the unpaid bills to suppliers from last quarter to the time of $500 million, that makes 3, the magic number, and they’d be close to broke now. Any help with that?",
What is TSLA doing that would attract $3-$5B from any source?  Bull nor Bear cannot dispute the fact that TSLA is underwater big time with the company's Debt profile.  Bull nor Bear cannot dispute the fact that its not foreseeable that TSLA can generate a profit in the near term.  Bull nor Bear cannot dispute the fact that there has to be foreseeable benefits to any company/market that will spend $3 to $5B more to keep TSLA in business.  Where's the incentive or financial benefit to lend/give/gift billions more to TSLA as production is fading fast on the Model 3.Where's the Beef?

"Here's how I see it.Tesla can't raise after Q1, because the abysmal results will not make for a good narrative. But I am of the opinion that they also don't have enough cash to make it past Q2 (with some finagling perhaps they can just barely squeak by, but there will be some white knuckles for sure.)Given the above, Tesla's best option is to raise before the end of March. However, there's no shelf filing and bonds would be expensive.The vice tightens...",
Just watched a Bloomberg segment on Tesla in which they highlighted the production issues and executive turnover as the principle bear case. No mention of the fact that they don’t come close to making a profit. Financial journalism malpractice. And on CNBC I heard an analyst explain that since Tesla’s multiple was so high it was a tech company not a manufacturer. Maybe that’s why they are having so much trouble manufacturing a car.Short,
I have watched Tesla from afar for a few years now. I thought it way over valued when it hit 200. There is something about elon musk that just rubs me the wrong way. I thought tesla shareholders were suckers when solar city was bought out. How has that worked out?? I never hear analysts talk about teslas solar business.,
Something you did not touch on Montana is that typically when issuing new shares companies discount the shares from the current market price to entice purchasers.  The amount of discount is proportional to the risk seen in the underlying company.  If a company like 3M issued shares the discount would be very small.  As for Tesla the sky is the limit for the discount.  Of course the greater the discount the greater the dilution of existing shareholders including the institutional purchasers if they already hold Tesla shares.  A delicate dance indeed.,
"Nice summary article. Sadly, I found it too optimistic on their cash position. I don't want to write what I am sure I know about certain aspects of the car design here, because I can't prove it without buying one and measuring a couple of things, and guess what? You can't get them. But Tesla is CLEARLY trying to fix a design problem with software, and the approach is doomed to fail. They will have to change course very quickly and it will involve more production changes so I just don't know. I think they could fix their problems and move into maybe producing 1.5K to 2K cars a week once they go to international distribution toward the end of Q3, but the problem is that they don't have the money to get there. And it will take a lot of money.",

To give them money is to throw it away.I always thought they should have licensed technology. I have said it forever, but it's too late now. Not to mention they aren't too good at building cars in any sort of efficient manner.  The thing is, Elon Musk couldn't care less. This is a game to him. He is so over Tesla it isn't even funny.

"Montana - Great article as per usual. Great stoff from Coverdrive as well.JOnas at MS has bailed on TSLA / Musk. Jonas knows that TSLA cannot access the debt markets again ...at any sane price. When Chief Acct Officer aand Treasuer leave at same time...one has to surmise that they are doing so to extract themselves from a bad (possibly fraudulent) situation.So no access to  debt market.An equity raise for $ 3 billion? It would dent the stock price at least 20% on the Offering...and be under pressure from there.The only thing left for Musk to do is to commit 3 million of his own TSLA shares for collateral and perhaps Baille (I doubt Fidelity) and some other Funds may take the shares.  I think that this was the advice from outgoing VP / Treasurer.Musk has to be meeting with potential ""donors"" right now. If they do take the shares as collateral, the shres would have to be priced at best around 280 (based on 322 close today), maybe closer to 250. Risk is of course that the ""donors"" get scared after a month or 2 and start selling into market to ensure their return.I do not see any other probable outcome. Do you or any of your esteemed SA authors think of another?",

It is strange that engineers from tesla just give up their job. This is also a sign that on the work floor, the R & D, the planning ... let us say that everything goes wrong. All those nice talks from Musk turned out to be just a shiver to cover up the true facts. He started digging a well that will be harder and harder to fill.",

I have no knowledge of their real reasons for their departure.But I do know (as a former tech senior finance executive) that Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 requires the CEO and CFO of public companies to ""certify"" the financial statements included in their 10-Q's and 10-K's.It is extremely common for the CEO and CFO to obtain ""sub-certifications"" from key personnel in the company such as the Treasurer, CAO and VP of Sales etc to support their certifications.",

"Montana:  Suggested addition to your section I above:  I think Tesla also will need to show that it is maintaining a high level of M3 deposits.  If the deposits are starting to drop materially, that could scare away potential capital raise investors.

"I've been tracking Tesla's sole straight bond, comparing it to yields on ""B"" bonds. First, ""B"" bonds are now trading at 6.25% – Tesla's bond has a 5.3% coupon. At issue the coupon was less than that of a ""B"" bond by about 30 bp. It then shifted to a 40-50 bp premium at the end of 2017. This year the yield on Tesla's bond had gradually improved from a 40 basis point premium to more-or-less track the ""B"" average [ICE BofAML US High Yield B Effective Yield].The last week it's moved back to a premium – though it's thinly traded and I only have daily ""B"" bond rates so it's hard to know what to make of it, I prefer to look at a several-day moving average. The data are crude in other ways, too – fees and buy/sell margins aren't detailed. Still, the last couple days have seen many trades at 6.75% and above, so the gap with ""B"" bonds appears to have widened in an unfavorable direction. In any case, for Tesla issuing a bond is an increasingly expensive route, mainly because bonds themselves have become more expensive.One other avenue: switching to franchised dealers. That can lower costs / improve cashflow in a variety of ways, but that would take time. However Telsa could also charge an up-front franchise fee. That's not done very often, because almost all dealerships that change hands are existing dealerships, and unlike many other franchise systems car companies don't charge an annual franchise fee. (They do charge the dealer for every display, brochure, and specify a list of repair parts a dealer must purchase and stock, so it's not as though a car company doesn't make money off their dealers indirectly.) Anyway, in the normal case the seller of an existing dealership captures the ""blue sky,"" not the car company. But for companies putting their toe in the market, it's normal to ask would-be dealers to pay to play. I've seen figures of $100,000 (Mahindra) but Tesla could try to charge much more, say $500K-$1 million However, at 200 dealerships even that might be good for $200 million tops, far short of their cash needs.With bonds expensive, more shares? warrant/convertible bonds? Neither is good for existing shareholders, but not raising money is worse.",
"April 1, 2018   In a press conference today, also attended by analysts, Elon Musk revealed the latest addition to the Tesla stable, the Model U. It will be a car for the masses and will cost $35,000 in the base version. It will have full autonomous driving capabilities in some countries, like Uzbekistan, but the list is projected to expand rapidly, following a stepped exponential algorithm. The Model U will have full battery swapping, and all charging can be done at supercharging stations completely powered by the sun (with a little left over).    Musk explained that the designation U was for Yugoslavia, where the car will be built in the new Terafactory, ten times larger and one hundred times more efficient than the largest automobile assembly facility on the planet. The first production vehicles are projected to arrive before October of this year, and reservations (at $3,500) are already being accepted. According to Mr. Musk, Tesla will produce between one and two million Model U vehicles by the end of 2019. ""People should have absolutely zero concern about that target, zero,"" said Musk.   None of the analysts asked Mr. Musk whether he knew that Yugoslavia, as a country, no longer existed. Several analysts noted that the price difference between the Model U and the Model 3 increased the intrinsic value of the Model 3 and revised their profit estimates for 2019 upwards.",

I think Tesla needs ca 2.9 bUSD more than you estimate by year end.1) I do not think Tesla can operate long-term with negative working capital (-1.1 bUSD as of Q4/2017). If I remember correctly manufacturing companies typically need WC of 10-15% of sales. Tesla might need lower WC because they sell directly to retail. Assuming 5% of sales and sales of 11 bUSD in 2017 results in WC of ca 0.6 bUSD. So they need additional 1.7 bUSD for working capital.2) I think you are optimistic about cash-flow from operations. My guess is 0 cash-flow from operations (as opposed to your assumption of 300 mUSD per quarter).",

A company of this quality that is so much out-of-favor deserves a buy, and a slight down day ought to be a good entry point even now.The best, AD",
"Selling/Buying Options that are one to two years out?  On a stock so many think is shooting to the moon ( I don't agree), that has a huge P/E, and is fumbling around to going nowhere?  I hardly think that is sage advice.AMD, on such a huge upswing and major movement day such as this Quad Witch, could not even squeak out 11.51 so that the Calls could have been assigned.  There's not much of anything positive to be said for this stock.",

This article and the comments are way over my head. Is the author saying that AMD is only a strong buy if you do some fancy options trading or is it worth buying now for the long-term?,
"That’s amateurish trading. You want to make big bucks? Buy in-the-money options (like on year long). Then the investment is just a fraction of buying the stock. If the stock goes up you get closed to 100% potential with like 25% investment. And if it trades down you have some kind of protection because your delta is lower than 1 and your downside is limited. Also, when the stock pop up you can sell call (short term, less than a month) at-the-money for a maximum of premium. That’s how you should use options when you are pretty bullish on a stock. That’s what I do and I do great (with Macy’s, AMD and MU). What you are suggesting is ok but nobody can do great with that. My two cents",
FT-- ! Bravo !3 Tenors-- ! Bravissimo !PS. Added AMD... MU soon. Placido Domingo my favorite ;),
"AMD admitted that around 50% of its card revenue was crypto in 2017...   quite sure NVDA is the same. Currently all crypto mining using GPUs is becoming unprofitable because of the protocols switching to ""no mining"" or ASICs taking over. There is a huge risk to semi-conductors in 2018. Sorry but I would not put a buy rating on any of them this year. Anyone else see that the SOX index is as high as it was in 2000. Complete tech bubble brought on by easy debt for buybacks.",
FT -- excellent summary of different ways to implement your bullish strategy on the three semi's. If I may suggest an additional option strategy: call spreads (i.e buying a lower strike and selling a higher strike call). This is a bullish strategy with well-defined risk/reward parameters. Of course you have higher commissions to deal with. I am fortunate enough to be able to trade commission free so that's not a consideration for me.Good trading/investing to all.,
In my opinion I think Nvidia could hit $400 dollars a share in the next two years.  Of course a recession would be the only thing that could realistically derail its gains.I plan to hold and add to my Nvidia position in the next recession.  Nvidia will be hitting its stride with autonomous cars if a recession hits in the 2019 - 2020 range.,
The least fortunate of them all is AMD. Everything has a reason!. Long and in the money!,
"LOL! Amazing this is the 3-4th article on AMD just today. Sorry I find this hilarious. No other name is more covered on SA, and the vast majority have been completely wrong. All I read is “it’s being manipulated” “it’s not fair” etc. I’ll just keep saying AMD will be at $12 by 12/31/18. If it hit $15 I’m buying puts. AMD is no where near as good as the other names in this space.","Semis: It's Not Only Who You Wish To Play With, But How You Wish To Play The Game (Part II)"

"Thanks for the note.  I also have owned for a number of years, first bought in 2013.  Not exactly exciting, but seems like a safe place to park money, though has limited liquidity.  You get a 5.5% dividend and seems like another 5 to 10% a year in price appreciation as any time they are lagging at too large a NAV discount they do a $50m or $100m buyback, which is immediately accretive.  I just can't see any catalyst that will erase the discount, but I do sleep well with my investment here.",
"I have owned TGONF for a few years now and have been happy with it. Management seems pretty smart, and IMO they have been a pretty good corporate steward in the past couple of years. Note that insider ownership is not really a plus in my view, as management issued themselves stock options/incentives in a couple sweetheart deals. I have been pestering the company for awhile about doing tenders/buybacks and not issuing new shares, and I feel that they have been acting more responsible in this regard. However, there is always the possibility they may wake up one day and decide to issue themselves a bunch more incentive shares and dilute all the other shareholders.So the high management fees and share dilution (combined with no shareholder voting rights) I think are the main reasons for the high discount. Another element may be that part of the NAV is the asset management business, where you just have to trust them this is marked properly.Also, for any potential US investors TGONF is a PFIC for US tax purposes, which means dealing with a complicated tax form if you own in a taxable account. That is why I prefer to hold TGONF in my IRA accounts.Finally, I like the company as a long-term investment, but with REITs, mREITS, and BDCs here getting beat up and offering high yields, a 5.4% yield isn't going to get anyone excited here in the US. For that reason, I don't see any near-term catalyst for this one.As an example, I own an mREIT at a 10%+ yield and 20%+ discount that is aggressively buying back stock https://seekingalpha.c...",Tetragon: Let The Numbers Do The Talking
FWIW and I'm probably talking to myself I nibbled today at $21+ with a stripped yield a little north of 9%.  The senior unsecured is trading at 8.1% so it could be a better deal.At some price the prefs will be a good deal.  I left room to average down once.  At $20 the stripped yield would tickle 10% which would be very cheap I think.  Management has taken leverage up this high before and then wrestled it down.  If so those prefs have some capital gain potential.  Maybe this will be the cycle where the company blows up but I doubt it.  And they are paying out an $85 million common dividend that likely would be cut first.,

"Very very complex investment.  Good job by the author setting the framework for analyzing prB in the preferred context.  100% agree with the author that at $24 prB is a better deal than prA at $23+.To me, though, prB is much more of an equity type investment than a preferred, given they operate a highly concentrated and illiquid portfolio on a quite leveraged balance sheet and offer a non cumulative dividend.  There are several major yellow flags.here.1)  Tangible book value seems to decline every year.  A steady decline in tangible book value combined with a lot of non GAAP (e.g., ""CAD"") measures to justify the common distribution suggest underlying weakness in the operations.2)  Heavy retail -- read: Amazon -- exposure.3) Borrowing short, buying long.  They have long duration assets but short duration liabilities (outside of the prefs).  In the unlikely event short term rates really spike it would be a major drag.4) Levering up late in the business cycle.  They are still out there buying despite all time high prices.  Makes me nervous.Anyway, CODI is a popular common stock -- trades at a moderate premium to stated book value -- and has maintained the distribution for a long time at the current level.  The external manager owns 15% of the units, which is a lot for this type of company.  Net net based on what I know now prB is better than prA or the common, but I'm not sure I would be interested in any of three at current prices.",

However, as a former Trican holder I am somewhat familiar with the negative macro picture in Canada including the political landscape.  The issue in Canada is not only ng takeaway.  It is oil takeaway as well.  Just look at the problems with the Trans Mountain pipeline.  Even though a Liberal government really appears to be behind the project, the environmental lobby in BC has potentially blocked the only route to get oil to market in Canada that makes economic sense, that is to sell directly to Asia.  Bringing Canadian oil to the US to compete against much lower priced US oil is not going to make Canadian oil production that much more profitable.  Until the BC political issues can be resolved Canadian OFS is not a good place to invest.",

"Good article!mTOR inhibition has the potential to slowdown the aging process in humans and significantly extend life span. This company is the logical continuation of the 2014 Mannick's study on rapamycin: ""mTOR inhibition improves immune function in the elderly""""AbstractInhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway extends life span in all species studied to date, and in mice delays the onset of age-related diseases and comorbidities. However, it is unknown if mTOR inhibition affects aging or its consequences in humans. To begin to assess the effects of mTOR inhibition on human aging-related conditions, we evaluated whether the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 ameliorated immunosenescence (the decline in immune function during aging) in elderly volunteers, as assessed by their response to influenza vaccination. RAD001 enhanced the response to the influenza vaccine by about 20% at doses that were relatively well tolerated. RAD001 also reduced the percentage of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes expressing the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, which inhibits T cell signaling and is more highly expressed with age. These results raise the possibility that mTOR inhibition may have beneficial effects on immunosenescence in the elderly.""Since aging is not considered as a disease by the FDA, resTORBio cannot expect their compound to be approved based on its alteration of the aging process. Hence, they are focusing on one aspect of aging which is immunosenescence. However, I believe that their approach has the potential to improve many age related diseases.",

"What a great series, Vlad!  Thank you for the hard work.  Ensco talks about 6 cycles over the past 30 years, and tries to frame the current environment as yet one more of those.  But this is the ""big one"", with perhaps only the '86 version being remotely comparable.  Most of the 6 cycles Ensco describes is driven just from the demand side (mostly oil price, and a steady climb of offshore oil as a percentage of total oil supply).  This one is driven by both demand and supply.  Rig supply/build cycle goes on for much longer than the oil price cycle, because once built, these equipment don't go away for 30 years, as you have so painstakingly documented in your series.  Day rate wise, we are certainly at the bottom.  How much further can it fall when day rates are at cash break even!  The question concerns the speed and magnitude of the ride back up.  And here's where a comparison to even the '86 version may be too optimistic:  Post '86, offshore oil took share in world oil supply, North Sea, GOM, African coast.  Today, at least in the short term, shale is the marginal growth in oil supply.Ensco speaks of 6 offshore cycles in the past 25years.  According to their presentation, in the first couple of bounces, utilizations went from 60% in '86 to above 90% in 1995.  Here are the net income in early 90's as reported in the 10-K for Atwood and RDC on sec.gov:              1994, 1993, 1992, 1991, 1990Atwood:  $6,209  $(1,791)   $(20,937)  $(7,042)   $(2,063)RDC:  $(13,259)    $  (73,753)    $  (44,368)     $    1,959",

This is available on SA under ""Ensco (ESV) Presents At 23rd Annual Credit Suisse Energy Summit - Slideshow""Using Slide #'s 4, 11 and 12 (lays out situation well)The average increase during the 6 ""booms"" was +~100 Rig Fixtures during these cycles.  Based on ESV's expected Supply inputs (new builds) and reductions (retiring rigs that will not work again) if we are at or near bottom then 100+ Rig Fixtures during another boom would mean 90%+ utilization with the global fleet as they've defined it.   Your good and detailed work - makes it clear that we are not at all near the ""boom"" phase but hopefully near the bottom of the bust and in ESV's own word's   recovery will be ""protracted and phased"".

I find it interesting that XOM refines 5 million bpd but only produces 2.5?  Recently bought more Asia Refinery / Ethylene facility... expanding Texas Ethylene production?  On the flip side XOM writes down its Nat.Gas assets (Dry gas) in USA and Canada ($1.3B) and ditto Oilsands in the Billions... perfectly acceptable accounting standards.  Suddenly Reserves crash using $40 oil and $3 Gas (not sure)...  How can Exxon ever expect to see profit on World Oil prices and World Nat.Gas prices?  $8 per mcf or $65 Brent...  the disparity on World Oil prices has narrowed... but maybe Nat.Gas seems stubbornly wide.  I've got to wonder who's making $5/mcf from USA Nat.Gas LNG...?  Lastly XOM seems shut out of many countries... like Russia?  Iran? Iraq? Venezuela? Libya?  not sure if Joint Ventures in any of these countries are dead...  it looks like XOM could make decent money on cheap Alberta WCS crude or this prolific Montney / Duvernay prospects...  turn cheap Nat.Gas into ethylene?  value added products... time will tell.,
"I much prefer that XOM management  put their money where it will provide the best returns. They have purchased cheap, really cheap, assets over the past few years, and have all the resources on hand that they need to harvest them.  That's the right thing to do from a business perspective. With XOM's worldwide diversification and multiple business lines, I can confidently continue to hold the stock if oil prices drop (perhaps adding more at appropriate places), knowing that the dividend will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.Think of it this way.  As a retiree, I depend on my portfolio for living expenses.  In the ten years since I retired, XOM stock has paid me much more than medium to short term bonds would have, and each year, the payments I receive go up.  I use XOM to partially substitute for Treasuries and Annuities in my portfolio. Unlike those, my dividends from XOM go up every year, about 8% annually over the past ten years. I believe that the foundation is there for that to continue.  XOM will sell the North 40 if they must before cutting their dividend. If & when I want to speculate on a bull market in energy, I take some of those dividends to buy call options on my favorite Rocket Riders.  But XOM remains at the core of my ""safe"" portfolio instead of a significant allocation to annuities (which disappear from my estate when we go) or Treasuries (which may well shrink or disappear sometime in the future due to the Fed or Congress).Viewed in this way, my only major decision is whether or not I can foresee a hit to XOM's dividend in the future.  As a result of the Analyst Day presentation, my outlook for the dividend is more positive than it has ever been.",
"maybe you can view XOM like a mule...stubborn, slow, steady...lower risk than most other oil companies and much lower, but steady safe dividend payout; their competition like RDS and BP historically have paid much higher dividends [BTW just as steady, even when perceived at high risk]...own all three; BP, RDS, XOM",
COP raised its dividend - but only after a prior significant dividend cut ( and after promising that the dividend was safe weeks before the cut). Hardly a company to look up to.,
"easy buy here, no stress until over $80.",
"another kool aid drinking article on how great the POTENTIAL and PROMISE is of xOm management production predictions at analyst and earnings meetings.  Yes yes XOM is a great long term hold..wow what an insight. Where is the article the day before the recent earnings or analyst meeting mr. Khan?  Make the same call then if your such a believer instead of yes yes xom was $89 the day before it cratered after another production miss and earnings miss, but yes now at $75 it is a great long term buy.",
Let me buy 500 shares at $66/share.,
Larger holder since it was STD Oil NJ. Drip drip drip ..... Great Company to keep in any portfolio,
If XOM fails the world will not be far behind.,
"Blasphemy. My Dad worked (1920-37)for Creole in Venezuela. A great company,part of XOM(1920-37)",
"I also am thinking of averaging down on XOM. But the company needs to show me they are being AGGRESSVELY proactive in the war against the envirowhackos who are out to confiscate wealth from the company in the name of ""global warming"" nonsense. There are people who want to turn the oil industry into the cigarette industry.",
"A few days ago it was 72 and change. That was a good entry point. I have enough Exxon and others in oil and gas, so I am not looking to add right here. But to ask for anything lower is being a pig. Don't like to buy things after they have done well, but you could buy right here as well. If you are worried about Exxon, you shouldn't be in markets.",
"...or could wait until it is $85, and then buy...",
Short answer....yes.,
"XOM with a >4% yield ... well, I am a DGInvestor and I am buying now!",
I will be buying more shares of XOM if they fall to 66.XOM is even an okay buy now.,
"The Board and upper management are a complacent, unimaginative and entitled bunch.  They don't lead, they don't plan, they don't inspire. They are oblivious. Their performance during a period of significant upheaval in the petroleum business has been mediocre.Barring a World War, the price of WTI is going to have difficulty getting above $65, and probably will meander closer to $50.  Run the XOM ""what if"" numbers using those assumptions before making your investment decision.",
"This company seems to have lost its way.  Up until the early 2000s, they had steady Capex that produced good returns and made smart mergers  (i.e. Mobil ).   After that, they over invested when prices were high (i.e. XTO), then cut when prices crashed.  Would have liked them to have picked up more cheap assets over the past 3 years.",
I am not an English major but XOM is performed superbly in the last six months.  The stock has produced excellent dividends.  Stock has not done well on the stock market but the company is out there cranking out the products we use every day.  That is a big difference.  I love those dividends and have added to my shares in the last month.,

"Everyone throwing stones at Mr. Axler really need to lighten up. Spruce Point (and Citron and Prescience Point, to name three short sellers) provide an extremely valuable service by highlighting ALL the negatives of a company. None of what Axler writes is untrue. It's just portrayed in the most negative light possible. I think it's convenient to have all the negatives of a company in one article, and I can then make a fully informed decision on a company. For example, Axler denigrates Arthur Andersen, but Arthur Andersen's felony conviction was reversed on appeal. Most former employees leave it off their resumes.Regardless, I think some of the knee-jerk reactions are just an excuse not to do the research. Or, to put it another way, use these articles are roadmaps to look further into a company.

Just like Andrew Left from Citron who wakes up some random day and decides to attack stock so he can make a quick buck, I see the same strategy here at play. Find a stock, cook up some research to justify your short position, attack the stock by writing articles and giving TV interview, bring it down, make money and get out. Heck, even buy low after bringing it down to take benefit of a rebound. This is the strategy of majority of short-seller analysts. It is nothing but pure manipulation and abuse of their power and influence to make money. I think the only way these low-lives can be beaten is by holding your stocks and let them attack it as relentlessly as they want to. Remember if you don't sell, it won't go down.

"As I commented on another thread, AMD will remain unloved and un-held by institutional investors until: (a) the valuation becomes too flagrantly cheap to ignore and/or (b) the company takes active measures to curb 'noise' volatility.If Elazaris right, (a) is due this year. The CTS debacle (in IR terms) tells me that (b) is a long way off. (AMD's lame blog post - http://bit.ly/2FKlAm0 - is an IR fail worthy of a Harvard Business School case study.)To reiterate the example from my previous post, take FSELX, the Fidelity Select Semiconductor Portfolio as an example:$3.6bn AuM, #1 holding INTC $689m (18.3%), #6 holding NVDA $188m (5.0%), rounding-error AMD $9m 0.24%.Why would Steve Barwikovski, the FSELX pm, risk his career going overweight AMD? He *has to* hold INTC ($241bn cap) and NVDA ($151bn cap) or risk  missing his benchmark. To be persuaded to shift some of his INTC/NVDA allocation to AMD ($11bn cap) he needs to be persuaded that (a) the stock is *screamingly* cheap and/or (b) if he holds it, his portfolio won't be subject to 'noise' volatility. AMD clearly fails test (b).I'm long AMD because I believe in (a). As a retail investor, I shouldn't need to worry about (b), *but*, my risk is that due in part to half-assed corporate communications, AMD will continue to trade cheap, right up to the day the economy takes a dive, or AMD hits a genuine, stock-specific, security issue.Dr Su need to raise AMD's IR game.",

The others like TR & vega (memory shortages) remained relative newcomers and modest contributors.Even now, 1 year on,  ryzen remains ~absent in the all important oem pc market - I heard ~70 such amd products are due soon.Amd are having this financial success largely from just the first of many product families to, briefly, properly stake its claim at its price point, in just the DIY enthusiast market, and thats a very good narrative for a booming amd.Look at the products competitiveness, not the financial rear view.I agree with your conclusion, but i dont share your faith in playing with flawed numbers",

What will be interesting is if future PC gamers will buy a console instead of PC due to inflated GPU prices. Then AMD will get some more dollars that would normally flow towards NVIDIA.,
Hard to argue with that.   Even if they don't blow out sales to your expectations and we're left with EPS of .6....and then the market decides they only want to give it a 25x PE....that's still a big upside from current levels.,
"I have not read through the numbers carefully, but I am in the camp of caution. I would rather see them beat the top and bottom line handily and then see GS and MS get in line and stop talking Crypto this and that.

"No reference to the impact of the accounting change. The Q1 guide is higher, in part, due to that change. IMHO you are overestimating as a result. my EOY target is $23.5. Similar methodology, just discounting for accounting difference and lower PE guesstimate at 30. Good luck all longs.",
"The real kicker is ""I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.""  If such great conviction than why not buy AMD?",

"Thanks author for reminding everybody that AMD just guided for $100 million in Q1 net income with Q1 being, historically, their weakest quarter of the year.While 81 cents might be a bit high, imo, due to a fall off in GPU during the year, Epyc will offset any loss in income from consumer GPUs and 50 cents per share is an almost certainty.",

I have a feeling the Boeing backlog is more solid than Airbus. I always felt Boeing sales team has  operated under a stronger discipline.,
"I was not reacting to the Feb orders, rather looking at orders and deliveries in general. Airbus for instance is making a lot of noise about taking the lead in annual deliveries by 2020, but even if they do Boeing's dominance in Wide Body deliveries would have far more value. I just think much too much is made of orders. Orders are the least reliable factor. Airbus has over 1,700 orders from nine airlines that currently in total only operate 430 planes. That's a 25% of their NB backlog chasing triple digit passenger growth. If we believe industry scuttlebutt Boeing may go to 60 NB a month and Airbus to 70. The Airbus backlog is supposedly 1,600 frames greater than Boeing's. Either Boeing is way to high at 60 or Airbus does not have a lot of confidence in their backlog, because the 10 frames a month would really eat into the backlog difference.",
I don't understand the order values are not considered over number of frames. When Airbus starts sell C series are you going to do the same? I just don't understand a system that gives equal weight to narrow body and wide body. Wide body frame cost 2 to 3 times what a narrow body does and in most cases produces a higher level of profit per frame.,

Ford has invested heavily in autonomous driving technology and has an agreement with Lyft to operate autonomous ride-sharing vehicles by 2021.  But ultimately, I think they have to also deliver on electric vehicles. I am long Ford and believe they have what it takes to compete with any automaker on the planet.

"So the real question is ""is Ford undervalued?"" Well, the answer would depend on one's perspective - the car enthusiast versus the investor versus the analyst. For all, the answer to this question presents a riddle with a ""quasi-sort"" of an answer. Questions along with some unconfident answers that lead to additional questions and some ""what-ifs?"" Ford makes good products (that are more competitive domestically than internationally) but Ford is not considered a car manufacturer of innovation, quality or luxury. Ford is better at producing products as inexpensive options for functional performance. Is Ford as an investment an underperformer - the answer is ""YES!"" Dilution help create this problem....",

Good buy at 11 today.,
What is their current cash position ?,
Any $SNDX raise coming? Market makers running up in anticipation of offering. No news and volume suddenly spikes?,
Been looking to enter SNDX for a while now. Will do so if it dips again. Been holding TGTX since $ 5.- so at current pricing it is nicely warming the cockles of my heart. Long TGTX.,
Sold SDNX also to early. But I believe TGTX has the bigger potential. Outstanding results will hit 25-30+ this year IMO.,
I think this price spike might be attributed to an upcoming cancer conference AACR.  They are due to present along with countless others but I think there is speculation they might have something big to report.,

Long term holder here. Great company with some great brands but as noted above it’s expensive currently and future outperformance is mainly hinged around EM.

"AMDs fixed issues with firmware. No performance impact. The issue pointed by CTS was anyway a non-issue as it requires Administrative rights.""It’s important to note that all the issues raised in the research require administrative access to the system, a type of access that effectively grants the user unrestricted access to the system and the right to delete, create or modify any of the folders or files on the computer, as well as change any settings. Any attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research. Further, all modern operating systems and enterprise-quality hypervisors today have many effective security controls, such as Microsoft Windows Credential Guard in the Windows environment, in place to prevent unauthorized administrative access that would need to be overcome in order to affect these security issues. A useful clarification of the difficulties associated with successfully exploiting these issues can be found in this posting from Trail of Bits, an independent security research firm who were contracted by the third-party researchers to verify their findings.""""The security issues identified by the third-party researchers are not related to the AMD “Zen” CPU architecture or the Google Project Zero exploits made public Jan. 3, 2018.

Also, the fact that you require admin access to exploit the vulnerabilities doesn't make it a non issue. Instead,  these vulnerabilities can  augment out of proportion the negative impact of what hackers can do with privilege escalation.

The fact that they didn't tells us they are not a legitimate research company.And when do you EVER read a research report on vulnerabilities that disclaims that the company doing the report MAY have an equity position (short, perhaps?) in the subject company.  That is complete BS.  They probably think that disclaimer prevents them from being pursued by the SEC.

"I agree with your optimism for Rolontis and poziotinib with pozio being way more important to the future of the company. I can easily live with Rolontis not being that successful as long as pozio is what the interim data so far shows it to be. As you say “Unlike Rolontis, Poziotinib is not a ‘me too’ drug going after a slice of a huge market. Poziotinib has genuine opportunity to be the first drug to have a meaningful affect treating the very niche market”. Here’s an analogy that’s feels so apropos with all these winter storms everybody seems to be getting:Rolontis, as a non-inferior drug competing with Neulasta and any biosimilars that could come to market, is akin to the snow shovel one uses to dig the snow from the front steps. Rolontis, as a bio-better, is akin to the snow blower, used to clear out your driveway to get to the street. Pozio, as a potential lifesaver and first in its indication, is akin to the snow plow that will be used to clear out the street!!!Ps I recently posted my thoughts on Rolontis as a biobetter which I figured I’d share here. Maybe someone who knows something about stats and the current P3 trial could comment?“Will Rolontis be superior to Neulasta? As a secondary endpoint, it’s not critical for BLA approval but is important in getting a marketing edge to any biosimilars, or to Neulasta for that matter, as a biobetter. So what is the probability that it will meet SS? While I don’t claim to know if it will, I think it has a much better than a puncher’s chance to hit it. Why? Well, we know from the Phase 2 trial that the high dose did meet superiority with a p-value of 0.023 whereas the mid-dose did not (p-value of 0.528). The current dosing in the P3 trial is at 90% of the P2 high dose so you would think that would do the trick. The one thing that bothers me in believing in this scenario is that the secondary endpoint wasn’t mentioned when top-line data came out. That would have been nice to know. So either it didn’t hit its p-value or maybe this is JTs little secret when asked by an analyst several CCs ago on what makes you so confident that Rolontis will be successful. Hopefully, we get to see full trial data at ASCO and not have to wait till SABCS in the fall. ”",

Independent reviews are integral to a physicians ability to administer treatments properly and are usually not subject to this level of statistical absurdity. This is deceptive to both investors and patients.,

"Hormel, like any food company, will not just sit on its past and make no attempt to accommodate to consumers' changing tastes. For example, they now offer Compleats, which are microwaveable meals that are not refrigerated. I try to eat very healthy and yet for one meal a day (lunch) I am eating a Compleat meal. The nutrition facts on those are actually quite decent. Consider that many people now believe that the overemphasis on not eating fats is not necessarily healthy. Eggs, which used to be on everyone's bad boy list of foods, are now considered healthy. Food science is in the process of being re-written (expect more of this as alternative views on what is healthy food are promoted).

"The stock is up in good part due 4Q proving out the subscriber economics of their business model. That is, explosive growth with largely contained operating expenses.GAIA’s churn appears to be running at about 3% per month, based on piecing together data points they’ve released on marketing/advertising spend and customer acquisition cost guidance. Netflix runs at 10% annually, but doesn't count a customer as churned if they leave and come back within 12 months so it is underreported, Amazon Prime is about 20% annually but that's tied to all Amazon services, Hulu is 50% and all other OTT/SVOD providers as a group are believed at 60% according to industry research. So, 35-40% annual churn is pretty damn good and it appears to be on a downtrend. Customer acquisition costs must be calculated on a gross (not net) basis and have been reported at less than $100 in recent quarters, and I suspect were closer to $90 last quarter. Those could come down 20-30% as they continue to scale. I totally questioned GAIA’s ability to contain costs with the kind of growth spike they reported in Q4 but heir channels, customer care, etc. seem to be a lot flatter than one would think. I don't know about $4.00 in EPS for 2021 but there's a ton of leverage in the model and they can really grow… hitting profitability by year-end 2019.Per valuation, GAIA owns the customer at $8/month with 85% gross margins and even with the recent run trades at $650 per subscriber vs. NFLX at $1300... and that’s a 50% discount in the context of GAIA growing subs 80% year-over-year with 85% gross margins vs. NFLX growing 24% with 35% gross margins.

"@ The Investment Strategist.  Your categorizations of and generalizations concerning Apple investors are not convincing. If Apple investors were really cult-like in their investment behavior, irrationally optimistic, suffer from confirmation bias, and ignored negative data, the stock prices would now be in the stratosphere.  Instead, Apple stock prices have languished <$180/share during the past 3 months at a P/E ratio that is nearly half that of its peers.  For the stock to behave this way, many Apple stockholders must be listening to the negative news and selling whenever the stock goes up.  For Apple’s P/E ratio to remain so far below average S&P 500 P/E ratios, I submit that many Apple investors suffer from the opposite syndrome: irrational pessimism.Take one data point presented in the FQ1’18 earnings report, i.e. 77.32 million iPhones sold in FQ1’18, compared to 78.29 million iPhones sold in FQ4’17 [http://bit.ly/2jTXue0].  The FQ1’18 iPhone unit sales is only 1.2% less than FQ1’17.  Further, FQ1’18 had one less week than FQ1’17 and FQ1’18 also saw a 6% decline in global smartphone sales.  So, Apple actually had an increase in iPhone unit sales per week in the face of a significant global decline.  Yet, this data point was interpreted by many as a failure by Apple.  Apple stock prices plunged over 10% even though Apple’s total and iPhone revenues increased by 6% and 13% respectively.  Please, this is irrational pessimism.In the same earnings report, Apple announced that they have 1.3 billion of installed iOS/Mac devices and also made a record $9 billion of revenues from its service division during the quarter.  Annual service revenue exceeded $20 per activated device in calendar year 2017.  With sales of >230 million iPhones per year and as much as 100 million other iOS devices (iPad, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and HomePod) and Mac computers, Apple may reach 2 billion active devices in 2020, all using Apple services and apps.  At $20/device-year, Apple annual service revenues may exceed $40 billion a year in 2020.  For any other company, this would be regarded as great news. However, Apple shareholders sold their stocks.  In the meantime, Apple announced that they will remain cash neutral.  Almost everybody jumped to the conclusion that this means Apple will spend all its repatriated cash.  As many as 50 articles have appeared on Seeking Alpha in the past three months, for example, speculating on what Apple will buy with its $150 million of repatriated fund after paying off its debt.  Many people have been openly salivating over the prospect that Apple would use the repatriated funds to buy back more stock or even give a huge one time dividend increase. If Apple investors had been irrationally optimistic, Apple stock would have jumped to $300.  Apple stock has not jumped to $300 or even $200/share, indicating that Apple investors do not believe that Apple plans to use all or even most of its repatriated funds to pay higher dividends and buy back its stock.  I believe that Apple’s stated intention to remain cash neutral means that they will not change their current cash position, i.e. they do not plan to spend or add to the cash after repatriation.  We shall see at the next earnings report.In my opinion, Apple would be stupid to use up its cash to pay off its debt or to spend it on additional stock buyback or dividends.  Its debt is earning money and it already has generous buyback and dividend policies.  Should the economy turn downward in the coming year or two, Apple has the best and most powerful defense possible, i.e. a quarter trillion dollars of cash.  Even if Apple paid off all its debt, it would still have $150 billion left to buy whatever company it needs at fire sale prices.  Apple can easily survive a major recession, continuing to sell its best-of-class-products, consolidating its supply chain, doing R & D to create the next generation of products, and readying itself for dominance of the market when the recession ends.  Apple’s competitors do not have deep enough pockets to do this.  Some will crash and burn.  Most will barely survive a major recession.  What is the likelihood that economy will turn downward?  In my opinion, the likelihood is 100%, if not next year, the year after.  The current bull market is now a decade long, longer than any other since World War II.  Given the behavior of the current administration, a trade war appears imminent between the U.S. and the rest of the world.  The Congress just passed the largest tax cut and the largest increase of defense budget In history.  With all the sabre-rattling by our president, the likelihood of further hostility in the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula, sub-Saharan Africa, and even with China is high.  In a recession, what company would you want to own?  Would you want to own Google, a company with ad revenues as its main source of income?  Would you want to own Microsoft, a company that is already in trouble with its lagging windows operating system, a failed smartphone venture, and a failing computer business.  Would you want to own Amazon and Its profitless retail businesses?  Or would you prefer to own Apple with its mountain of cash and its best of class products: the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Watch, AirPods, and HomePods?",

"While the article points out several biases that are dangerous to fall into and it looks at various metrics to prove or disprove its investment thesis it misses a crucial dimension in investing.As Apple is a technology stock it completely misses an analysis of the company’s fundamental strategy and its relative success or failure of its technology Financial metrics are of course important to “objectively “ compare one company to another or to unearth red flags that should be investigated. But without understanding the company and its aims the analysis is incomplete.Apple provides products in 3 main categories: phones, computers and tablets. Additionally it provides products in the speaker market ( beats, AirPod and HomePod) as well as watches. It also provides services as iTunes, music and the app stores show.In its consumer electronics categories Apple seeks to dominate the premium category which it does in the computer, watch, phone tablet and arguably mobile speaker categories. It’s services dimension is growing speaking to it’s ability to support and grow its usersIt has industry leading technology in its processor which powers its phone, watch and tablet products as well as unique technology that powers various hardware and software features like faceid, Apple Pay and others.Over time it’s strategy has proven to be effective as it is reported by third party analysis to dominate the watch industry, mobile payments, App Store revenue, phone revenue, computer profits, etc.",
"""I agree that a pullback in the market, and Apple stock, can present an attractive buying opportunity - but a safe haven asset? What? Really?"" It is my opinion that Apple does not pull back as much or advances as others pull back because the stock never advances to the unrealistically sustainable P/E levels of the average Tech stocks.  Yes I understand that with higher growth rates comes higher P/Es as we expect the companies to grow into their P/E with higher future sales.  Yet Apple is growing by larger actual dollar amounts.  Something about large numbers.  I see Apple maintaining its high of a 19 P/E and low of 13 P/E for the foreseeable future.  And with a compressed P/E range we will see the safe haven that is normally seen only in Utilities, because of their compressed P/E ranges.  ""What?"" Yes Apple does not get the 35 P/E and there for has less compression during market retreat.  Then ""Yes"" Apple leaps faster than most of their competitors as we saw last year.  So while Apple does drop it comes back faster from a much shallower depth, it just does not jump as high.  And ""Yes Really!""",
"would like to read about apple r&d, about afterlife after iphone. Never been long or short with apple but cannot ignore company sitting on mount everest of cash. Company that can ignite new bull market or prolong current one. Can somebody point me to such articles?",
"Very interesting article. I know a number of Apple investors who think they are brilliant investors. However, a look at their other holdings often disproves that belief considering that we have been in one of the biggest bull markets ever (if not the biggest). Yet they still believe that Apple, their big winner, cannot fail to outperform in the future.This line in the article jumped out at me:""A company of its size that can still generate 24% EPS growth even as unit sales decline is intriguing. That means there's still considerable pricing power there.""To be an accurate statement it needs to be edited to say ""That means there WAS considerable pricing power there."" We know in the last quarter they had pricing power. We DON'T know whether it will still be there in future quarters.Obviously, the decline in unit sales during the rollout of 3 highly touted new models, is not ideal. My observation has been that declines in unit sales are often attribuutable to a product or product line losing it's ""cool"". However, this can be a long and drawn out affair. I fear that's what's going on here. If sales continue on the current trajectory, no amount of price hiking will cure the problem. On the otherhand, the dip in unit sales might just be a temporary phenomena. Which way this goes is subject to consumer whims worldwide and cannot be known with certainty. And that is the real risk of this stock. Those who think consumer appetite for ""premium"" Apple products has no limit are living in a fantasy reality. It's extremely rare for any high end consumer good to achieve the kind of market share as the iPhone. To maintain this share over an extended period of time is even more unlikely. And to believe the difference can be made up with future price hikes is even more unlikely. The bottom line is that Apple needs to expand into new markets in such a successful manner that it can make up for whatever it loses in iPhone sales. And that is what a bet on Apple is really gambling on. It's far from a sure thing.like so many starry-eyed shareholders seem to believe with the same fervor that they believe past performance IS an indication of future performance.",
"Maybe the problem with the author's article is that he shows bias himself IN the article--such as taking an ""unnamed sources"" report as a legitimate factor on which to base a decision. Yes, I'm fully aware that some people have to try and accommodate fluctuations in the market but if someone is comfortable with their investment, they're not going to let short-term events make their decisions for them. I've survived two recessions since buying Apple and I'm quite happy with where it is today. I'm looking forward to the future because Apple simply has a habit of doing things better, even if they aren't first to bring out a technology. Considering I've seen a near 10,000% gain over my initial investment, I'm quite happy.",
What about China trade retaliation risk? This does not appear to be priced in to the current price. Buyer beware.,
"""Even though unit sales were flat or declined for the company's Big 3 products,""And then there's your 14/13 bias:Forgetting that 14 weeks is 7.7% larger than 13 weeks and (oops!) that means the Big 3 were all positive; not one was flat.",
"The safe haven question is an interesting one. Now if you want to be truly safe from a stock perspective, as in do everything based on downside risk protection, AAPL isn't all that safe when you compare it to companies like JNJ, MMM, GIS, K, CLX, various utes, and so on. You also give up your capital appreciation opportunities.However when it comes to technology stocks I do consider Apple to be one of the safest. First, it sells an addictive product. Now I'm not saying that people will choose to keep their iPhone over buying food but I'm not saying they won't either. I do not see a lot of safer tech stocks out there. Companies like NVDA, MU, AMAT, and so on will drop much further in a recession.I don't want to give up all tech because we may (probably will) have a recession. IMO AAPL along with MSFT and INTC are among the better holds in the sector. They'll still drop but less than and later than others and they should be among the leaders when the market turns back the other way. And again, I'm balancing downside risk with the opportunity for continued appreciation. I'm not ready to go 100% defensive.",
"This article misses the mark in my opinion...The bias that I see more than anything is a popularity bias... I call it ""biggest band in the world"" bias or ""hipster"" bias. Things that are cool until they get so big. At a certain point it becomes ""cool"" to not like those things. Basically there is a certain segment that will dislike Apple for nothing more than they want to be different. Apple could cure cancer and these people would claim they stole it, or that they didn't really cure it. They would find a way to diminish it. I find it very telling that they Android phone that won out in the Android market was the closest thing to an iPhone in the Samsung Galaxy. While people were saying, ""I just don't like Apple or the iPhone,"" they were consistently choosing the Android option that most closely mimicked the product they claimed to hate.It's not really wrong to say that Apple has a rabid fan base. It does, but it's largely warranted. Anyone who has been negative on the company or its products has been objectively wrong for over a decade. The articles written about Apple that get a massive number of negative comments often suffer from the bias mentioned above and are and low quality. They often misrepresent things or even have outright misstatements of fact. If they do have a rational point it's the same point that people have been saying for years and have been consistently wrong on. To be frank, it's pretty hard to make a bear case for Apple. And this article doesn't even really attempt. It just names a bunch of biases (while leaving out the biggest one that I mention above) and then says, but the stock is probably a good buy.",

"I agree with JP but also to a large extent with the author.  Apple is definitely a great business to be invested in.  That is how people should be viewing it.  Invest in a business.  Worry about the stock only for entry, exit and valuation purposes.  The author is correct in the biases.  We see that all the time.  The whole battery issue was exaggerated but otherwise he makes very good points.  I would add (and I apologize if I missed it), a trade war represents a huge risk to Apple given the large % of business now outside the U.S.  It is very difficult to quantify this risk since policy appears to be made on the fly these days.  Overall, the big picture for Apple is very good. However, no stock is a safe haven but, imo, in the long run, the huge moat Apple has makes it safer than most other stocks.  NOT a safe haven though.",
"If you're betting on the short, or even mid, term movements of APPL the stock, then your risks are probably no different than many other stocks out there. But if you're interested in owning a share of a business at a fair price - including it's assets, cash flows, earnings, and management team - you'd be hard pressed to find a less risky proposition. The author states that ""In my humble opinion, readers should read articles and reports that are critical of Apple stock just as enthusiastically as positive articles, so they can get a well-rounded view of a company before determining whether or not to invest"".Well, IMHO, readers should read the 10Qs and 10Ks to get a ""well-rounded"" view of a company before determining whether or not to invest and, if they don't understand what those reports are telling them, then they probably shouldn't be investing in individual stocks on their own. I'm less of an Apple enthusiast as I am just an admirer of the business. The actual results they produce are mind numbing. As far as the stock price is concerned, I have no idea whether it's going higher or lower during the short/mid term, but I think that the business is fairly (and conservatively) valued at around $190 today.",

Also, the presentation showed that when it comes to downstream investments, management is investing in existing assets - I don't recall any green-field projects being mentioned in the presentation.  Shell on the other hand is building a new green-field ethane cracking plant in Pennsylvania using Marcellus gas as feedstock to enter local markets.  I'm not saying that Shell is better than XOM.  But I am saying that XOM's capital allocation struck me as very cautious.",
"""Exxon certainly has the global scale and reach. It estimates oil demand to grow by 20% per year through the period 2016-2040, roughly 8% per annum."" This does not seem quite correct.I assume that ongoing demand is expected to increase by 20% over a roughly 20 year period.  Such an increase would be more like 0.8% per year.  Currently the consumption growth is in the 1-2% per year so the above assumes a flattening demand curve.  That seems imperative given the rate of consumption (40 billion barrels per year) versus known global reserves (1.2-2.1 trillion barrels which would be only 30-50 years of consumption).  I am guessing that reduced carbon usage will be driven more by cost than by mandate given what is known.WD",
"Article was a good read.  Thanks, Jennifer..",
"I think people are confused by Exxon gradually shifting to be energy focused, not just on oil even though its exposure to other energy sources is meaningless in size and their investment is still mostly oil related. It makes it a great time to buy, especially since they see oil prices stable enough to begin increasing capital investment again.2 things about Exxon. 1) It would have been nice to see it increase capital investment 6 months to a year ago but it  is understandable that it's extremely cautious. 2) I'd like to see it invest oil close to Asia more than the US because Asia is the area of strong growth in oil even though they also are big on alternative energy. US oil expansion so far has been a driver for capital expense more than profitability for most oil investment the past 4 years. Exxon was smart not to get overly invested in them early on.3) There are other more oil/gas price dependent plays that pay better when oil rises. Just be aware of the risk, although I think it has diminished based on Exxon's long term assessment. Be especially cautious of companies burning negative cash flow and losses even today at these prices. Banks support them because they don't want to recognize the loss and can't get out of them easily. There is no reason why others should be heavily into them.",

"Just wondering how oil and gas companies are going to come up with the cash to expand their fossil fuel production along with alternative energy? Personally I think that the only reason these companies are even talking about a low carbon future is because of the insane followers of global warming, now climate change, and soon global cooling.  Since this group uses the government to extract punishment for any company that doesn't tow the line, again how are they going to come up with the cash to expand? Over the years I have watched these companies being attacked at first for high oil and gas prices, and now for carbon, a basic element needed for plants to grow. Another thing that I see is the vitriol of those who religiously follow the climate change ideology has been intensifying as they force their views on even those who disagree. Sadly if this group continues to bully the dissenters I see our economy eventually slowing and possibly even contracting if they are successful because without energy growth the economy can't grow.",

"Your article is full of misinformation – please see below.  60% of the float is short.  Any sign of positive news (buyout or otherwise) and this stock will scream, so best of luck.1.	The company is not rumored to be for sale.  It is for sale and has received MULTIPLE bids, including $13/share (45% above today’s price) from a PE firm (Vintage Capital) that has attempted to buy AAN 4x.  Vintage has access to capital and a strong desire for RCII’s assets.2.	Financial trends are improving. January SSS were flat and February were positive (despite false comments from some sellside analysts).  Savings will also expand margins and grow profits.3.	Financial leverage will not dissuade most buyers because they can recapitalize it as they please. 4.	The “current management team” includes CEO Mitch Fadel that was only put in this position in January.  He was very successful for decades at RCII (before financial trends turned south) and helped EZPW improve its US business.  Mitch has since brought back his former head of marketing.5.	The targets set by prior CEO Mark Speese were obviously unrealistic, but Mitch’s are not.  He’s guiding to $130mm of FCF on zero growth implying the stock trades for < 4x FCF. Removing benefits from tax credit and NWC, it trades for only 11x unlevered FCF assuming zero growth.  And remember, the company is now starting to grow again per my second comment.6.	If AAN acquired RCII, then it could generate savings equating to at least 2% of combined sales or $120mm.  This should be conservative given the substantial store overlap and the fact that RCII has $140mm in overhead alone .  But sticking with $120mm and RCII’s announced savings, AAN could pay north of $20/share and it would still equate to < 10x unlev FCF and < 6.5x EBITDA.  This would be highly accretive to AAN’s current valuation of 10x EBITDA.",
"I’m no bull on the underlying business but in the right hands, I think there’s a good possibility of tremendous upside if they can transform. Therefore, a buyout is the most logical outcome so RCII can start on a fresh page and figure out how to compete with Aaron’s (which is totally doable). Given that Engaged now controls the BOD and has assigned their own CEO and stated they want to sell and that Vintage has twice made an offer and own 6% of the common, a buyout seems likely. Who knows at what price but the bonds will be made whole regardless of price and that’s where I’m invested.",
With around $1.7B in gross profit they should certainly be able to trim some more fat and produce cash flow to handle the Interest. The layoffs/cash flow consultants good start IMO.,

"""Management’s targets"" you are referring to is not the current managements target.  Hence the  ""Targets Look Unrealistic""-segment of the article is irrelevant.

Well, you could argue that due to high leverage, a small premium relative to EV is a huge premium relative to MV, hence the high leverage could also encourage buyers.",

It appears that the ""awful"" results reported in the most recent quarterly report were an effort to ""clean the balance sheet"".

love baba,
"ALT  PERSPECTIVE    I would like your thoughts on the following. If BABA 's shares are sold on the Shanghai exchange this summer as anticipated. In my opinion the stock price could rise 10% /15%.  However, could these additional shares possibly dilutethe share price ?  Many thanks.",
"I think that a fair comparison of Alibaba and amazon should include the buying power of their respective average consumer, the goods that are being purchased, and the frequency of those purchases as a function of share price volatility. I think the recent bump in amazon's share price has something to do with last year's tax cuts and market speculation by fund managers. Alibaba operates in a different rules pond.",
Any idea why Baba’s Beta is 2.5 something? It fluctuates so much that I’m kinda scared,
"Tend to agree. its a good opportunity exploiting jingoism and the misunderstanding between the two fundamentally different ways of doing business. In crypto I see an analogy with NEO.In this space there is also WeChat Pay with a decent market share. Wechat is serously underrated as a chat app. ApplePay should be doing better than it is in the West but the regulated marketplace still favors old tech (credit cards, legacy banks) etc. ApplePay has next to no chance in China though its interesting it is looking to build market share there.Does a profitable investment in Alibaba require expansion into the West? or is it enough for the Alibaba to keep doing what it is best at?",
Price/Free Cash Flow is best determinant of value - especially when taken through 3 & 5 year periods.,
China is in growth and clearly has the world’s largest and fastest growing middle class. Investing in Alibaba now is almost incomparable to anything else. Tremendous growth ahead to those who see straight. You may have wished to buy AMZN in the 200s but perhaps questioned the price at the time... these opportunities are truly rare in the market!,
"OK, it’s obvious in general and in the AMZN / BABA debate - we know that valuation has nothing to do with share price.  Once BABA is listed on the Chinese mainland the price will sky rocket as Chinese retail investors get on board. I’m just guessing, but at the very least nationalistic impulses and paper profit potential (PPP) will seem enormous. Do you think that average Chinese investor and speculator will be cautious? Why would they be any different from US pickers?  BABA’s future stock price may be good for all the bad reasons, but people will profit.",
"The reason AMZN command a higher valuation is not many people in US used BABA (TaoBao or t Mall) and AliPay or understand BABA's venture strategy, the sum of its parts.  I am looking forward to see BABA, JD and others plan on listing in Shanghai which will create a back pressure of share demand and then stock valuation.",
Thank you for the analysis. I am constantly wondering why AMZN has a such a superior value to BABA,
I invest in China mainly through MCHI but Baba is on my buy list and I will buy it when it gets oversold.  I lived in Taiwan for a while and have good fluency in Mandarin.  I've also visited China and know that most Americans don't understand the rapid exponential growth in the Chinese economy.,
"Nice article ALT.  Both are great companies and both are being priced closer and closer to perfection as we continue this longgg... bull market.  I prefer AMZN mgt. vs BABA.  From a valuation prospective, BABA is less expensive.  Both are priced to perfection and either will get hammered during the next bear.  If I had to own one, AMZN would be the choice.",
"I have been buying BABA since around $88 and have no plans to sell anytime soon. I am probably overweighted, but my sentiments are the same as yours.",
"American middle class is dead, as is Europe's. By 2030, China's economy will surpass the US and by 2050 it won't even be close.Middle classes in Asia and Africa are just getting started, and BABA will be there to service them. Amazon was the story of the last 20 years. BABA will be the story of the next 20 years.",
"The PE's say it all.  AMZN would have to increase profits by 20-fold for it's PE to return to earth (How can you have a PE of 255???  Seriously.).  BABA would be more like 4 fold.  Does AMZN have 5 times the upside of BABA given their current market caps and when comparing each other's TAM?  AMZN has a crazy level of risk at its current price.  Then there's Mkt Cap to Equity.  AMZN Mkt Cap to equity is 28x.  BABA is 12.5x.BABA is the better value (if value is the right word).  I don't know their businesses in sufficient detail to work it out, but on the outside I think BABA has more upside and less financial risk.  (PRC risk?  Well there's that too...)GLTA",
I believe this is an excellent analysis of the potential of Alibaba,
Alibaba is only an emulator of Amazon. Amazon is now entering Vietnam and perhaps will dominate Asia in future. Probably the market is correct to value Amazon more than Alibaba,
"I recently sold half my AMZN, all profit, & put it into BABA.  BABA's numbers make more sense to me right now.  AMZN just might crater in a recession.",
I would trade BABA - many times as it trades within a range usually for several months - instead of owning it for the long haul. Not doubting its potential- just saying vigilance is important.,
"I agree that BABA looks much more undervalued than Amazon right now.  I think a large part of that are trade war fears and just the typical China discount from the West.Trump tweet storms a lot but I rather doubt that a true trade war will happen.  Trump just hired Larry Kudlow who is very much a free trade guy.  Trump will continue to bluster to throw red meat to parts of his rabid base, but, unless he feels he has nothing to lose, we won't get into a trade war with China.  I certainly hope not as it would be asinine.",
"author, while I agree with you on most points, I don't think using stock price appreciation since Oct 2017 providing much perspective.  If you look back, they both roughly doubled in the last 52 weeks.  Is BABA under valued or is AMZN simply over priced or both over priced?  I don't disagree they both are growing at break neck speed and market seems cannot get enough of AMZN. But to evaluate BABA's potential value based on relative performance to AMZN stock price is not safe.  Although I cannot help to do just that myself.  I will venture to say that AMZN is over priced and I hope the current BABA stock price doesn't reflect the AMZN run up.  More analysis needs to be done on BABA's absolute current value.",

"Does anyone here really trust the Chinese government as it relates to BABA? I mean, I admittedly don’t know as much as some of you, but I do have a good meter for BS which has served me well. In this day an age where stocks take a dive after positive earnings report, I only see BABA becoming more volatile as more speculative buyers jump on the train. Two corrupt governments, and a platform with good competition is dangerous. I’m ready to long JD, BABA, or BIDU, I just don’t know what train to board... help?",

"I think JD.com is the more trusted site in China, but it is full of endless duplicate listings and an extremely frustrating amount of “bait and switch trickery”. The pictures and the descriptions often lead you to believe that it’s a good deal, just to discover that you’ve been had. This style of commerce is typical in China, so it makes sense that it has made it into their online commerce. For this reason, I believe the Amazon style is better. I don’t like what Amazon is doing to the country, but I have to admit that their customer service is pretty amazing.",
It doesn’t take a lot of brainpower...just look at the number of consumers!  Americans who distrust Asians need to realize Asia is an emerging power while Europe is fading (which will change when African and Middle Eastern immigrants take over).,
I wonder how long the Tri-Lateral Shipping Alliance Signed with eBay GC and China Post will last.  This is the mechanism that Chinese companies use to ship items to the USA.  I have owned several eCommerce websites since 1999.  A Chinese company can ship an item to a customer in the USA at a lower price then I can ship a package from Minnesota to California.  The US government has agreed to subsidize the shipping costs of items from China.  Knowing Trump's stance on China will they eventually scrap this type of shipping subsidy.  Here is a link that explains the shipment agreement.   http://bit.ly/2tVkjXy,

China and its companies' financials comparatively opaque. Don't trustinfo from secretive government. Not enough info.,
BABA's low figures relative to AMZN is probably more a reflection of their markets - China is heavily dependent on European customers and  with Europe currently tearing itself apart (politically and economically)  that poses grave threats for China's growth. AMZN is dependent on the US and the US is less heavily exposed to overseas markets.,

"I've held my initial buy in BABA since the beginning and purchased quite a bit more up to $125.  I'm not worried about the company as much as the float-It's very large.

I purchased JD.com 4 years ago at IPO and it has taken all that time to begin to respond in any way of  great appreciation and so so many Chinese are customers also of it, maybe more than BABA but BABA has and will continue to appreciate.  I think comparisons are a reach to prove someone right and someone wrong is all.  My only concern is that I am right and so far so good.",

Every time a Chinese company reports, I'm just left thinking they are making their numbers up. Every time you read a Chinese company's SEC reports, you just want to pull your hair out. One of my favorite passages from a recent report: ""we reserve the right to NOT pay dividends to foreign investors if it is not practical or convenient to do so."" Other times they warn that they are based in China and registered in the Cayman Islands and so a lawsuit in America is a waste of time. You're never sure if you own a part of the company or if you own a part of the holding company that owns the company. It's not quite the same thing. Chinese companies have proven very creative in inventing customers out of thin air. Chinese CEOs can withhold the most lucrative part of a business for themselves. Imagine buying GM stock and finding out that a lucrative part of that business is not owned by the shareholders but owned 100% by the CEO and founder. The richest and most experienced Chinese businessmen will be the first to tell you about the level of extreme corruption in China.",

AAPL should announce some new big opportunities for all this cash. Buybacks are fine and dandy but don't add as much value to long-term investors as new project with a great NPV do. Something like an EV would make so much sense when you have all this cash and the sun is just about to dawn on the EVs. Apple has already diversified into mobile payments. More diversification for the product portfolio would do so much good. Look how MSFT is diversifying away from just one or two of core products.,

"the last Q was made to be worse than it really was. The outstanding Uniwheels shares were 'put' to SUP, which cost them $30 million. There are $20 million Uniwheels shares remaining (as I understand it) - so this timing is a risk, because it's out of SUP's control. But the good news is that this's the last of them.The negative European car market hit last Q hard too - SUP said this will continue for a while. It's based on the car re-designs, due to the emissions scandals - so this affects all car production there and as the industry's in a lull, SUP are caught up in it too. The North American operations aren't affected by this though - so that's the beauty of diversification right? SUP said their next Q (the one to be reported soon) won't be as bad as the last. We should know soon.On the positive side - they have a lot of available credit - I think it was ~$180 million? So can weather the storm for a while and it's inevitable that the cycle will turn at some point (people need cars and cars need wheels!). Also Uniwheels was a best-in-class operation, so SUP's North American factories can learn a lot from the Europeans. SUP said that the NA factories have twice the waste aluminium, than the European factories. I am happy to hold this one and watch it play out (I've bought a lot over the last 4 months) - I think it should be ok, but my intended time frame is >5 years. The main thing I'm concerned about is them having to cut the divvy for a while. I really hope they don't ( hate parking $ with no divvy....), but I'll hold regardless if they do - short-term pain, long-term gain.

Kevin - are you asking about the same SEC which is totally blind to how RAD/WBA merger was called off in heist by RAD CEO Standley? Are you referring to same SEC which has ignored plundering and pillaging of stockholders of RAD by CEO & BOD? And is this the same SEC which does not find anything objectionable about merger of RAD with ABS -- a forced marriage at gunpoint to the head of RAD shareholders - just so that Standley comes out winner?If so - then the SEC you mention is long gone and on vacation. There is LONG queue of misdeeds SEC has given total blind eye. In fact as a LONG shareholder of TSLA - I would say Elon has done everything to HELP LONGS - done everything to hurt SHORTS - including those who pretend they understand finance and thus they understand engineering.So look no further -- RAD is your proxy.

"It is now precisely ten years from the collapse of Bear Stearns. The lessons of that day apply to Tesla. Backers of Tesla insist that Musk can easily raise capital. All that has been raised over the past three years has been destroyed (no -- it has not been 'invested' but rather burned through the operations of the company, hence part of the reason for the need for more capital). But regardless, it is an undeniable fact that Tesla has historically been able to raise more equity and debt, and has continued to dilute current ownership, with little appreciable impact on the market capitalization.  This pattern forms the basis for the assertions of some that Tesla has a future. All that needs to be done is to back to the bottomless well one more time.Why is this the case? What explains the willingness of capital markets to continue funding Tesla? It all comes down to trust. To this point the market trusts and has trusted Musk to eventually deliver the goods. He has not yet done so (to those who call the previous models 'successes' they all share one commonality. They are and always will be money losers). But as long as the trust in Musk remains to do that which he has never done, the money flow will continue.What does that have to do with Bear Stearns? That story was also ultimately about trust. Bear Stearns was not burning capital like Musk, but they did have a highly leveraged and ultimately toxic book of investments that proved to be much less valuable than assumed. The market did not care (many did not know), but that didn't matter as long as those engaged with Bear Steans trusted that their trades and accounts were safe. But when the day came (ten years ago) that the trust was gone, the end came swiftly and with unmerciful pain to the owners of Bear Stearns. The trust was there one week; and one week later it was not. Trust in anything and anyone is a fragile thing. Trust in Elon Musk, to do that which he has never done, will not last forever. There are only two possible outcomes for Tesla long term.  The company either evolves to a self-sustaining entity, generating sufficient capital returns to avoid new injections of capital, or it dies.  The former seems physically impossible, at least without one last capital injection that would massively dilute ownership, with restructuring of the company and refocusing on core businesses. The financial disaster that is Tesla is all the proof one needs to demonstrate what some have aptly characterized as 'structural bankruptcy'. Such a condition has zero to do with what one's opinions are of the cars, one's views of the mission, or the price of eggs. How much money would be needed and who would take this on are interesting debatable subjects. What Musk's role in such a restructuring would be is uncertain. Would financial backers insist on his presence? Or would they insist on his ouster? It would be totally up to whomever might step forward. But absent such backing, a continuation of trust producing repeated capital injections; a continuation of the past five years, is simply impossible long term. The trust, like the capital that follows it, will eventually be consumed. The well is not bottomless...not for Elon Musk; not for anyone.",

The thing that I keep feeling underwhelmed by in the articles & other commentary to date on this theme is that they seem to equate fraud -- very specific misstatements of past facts, what we see with Madoff and Theranos -- with unwarranted/unrealistic optimism about the future, what I think we've been seeing with Tesla.

"Great article.  I think we can add one more whopper to the list of false statements. ""We shut down the line to improve production"". I think we will find at some point that they shut down the line because suppliers stopped delivering parts until they had cash in hand. We have a couple of red flags for a company out of cash. 1) Key management departures, especially finance people.  2) Potential supplier holdups for slow pay or no pay.If we start to see 'sick outs' at the plants it is because workers are using available time off to look for another job.   If the stock starts to fall rapidly it may reach Musk's margin point. I think that is somewhere around $150 a share, although it may be higher given the recent run up. The financial statements disclose that Musk borrows against his stock 'to maintain an executive lifestyle'. Since he takes no salary and none of his companies pay dividends we can assume this is his only source of cash. When the stock price reaches that point 22 percent of the stock will be liquidated at the current price. That could happen in a matter of hours.",

There are probably very few of you who recognize point #2, but you should at least hear someone say it out loud.Thus, these two factors mean that Tesla has a very, very long runway for takeoff.

We probably agree on that much.Further, a point of reference for saner heads --Ford today recalled 1.3 MILLION cars because the STEERING WHEEL CAN FALL OFF.

"To be clear, Tesla is certainly guilty of flaunting the SEC regulations that state that GAAP accounting must be emphasized over non-GAAP. Furthermore, they've certainly stated a lot of things that are over-the-top and fail to materialize, but it's not anywhere near what Holmes did. Holmes used competitors tests and passed them off as those done by Theranos. Meanwhile, Theranos's flawed tests were shown to be absolutely crap and they had to invalidate two years of testing. In other words, the SEC is acting on something that was a fraud from top to bottom. The issue with Tesla is that despite the grandiose claims made by Musk, a lot of what he says is actually done, just much slower and clumsier than advertised. While I think the purchase of Solar City was shady, and that he's withheld certain information he should have disclosed - such as the issues with the falcon wing doors, I don't know that this rises to the level of an SEC investigation. The SEC is meant to protect investors, and has to be careful that it isn't unduly harming investors just because the CEO is prone to exaggeration. Just think of what would happen to Tesla's stock price, and ultimately the company, if the SEC announced it was charging Musk with fraud for stating he would produce 5K cars by the end of 2017? How does this help investors? Then where do you draw the line for other companies? Moreover, what exactly is supposed to be the big lie the SEC is protecting investors from? It's rather easy for a potential investor to fact check Elon, especially if they come here. In short, yes, the SEC needs to have a serious talk with Musk, but it doesn't protect shareholders if they just start laying charges.",

"Let's imagine that Tesla has a genuine 300,000 reservations for the Model 3 and everyone who has paid a deposit for their car, has daily access to their Tesla account - which clearly states an estimated delivery time for every type of Model 3:First Production: $48,000 Available April - June 2018 Long Range, PUP Delivery ChargeModel 3 Dual Motor, ""Coming Soon"" - Fall 2018and Model 3 Base Vehicle $35,000. - Standard Battery - Spring 2019Where's the fraud in those statements?  Did Tesla promise a car from a prick of your finger?  Did Tesla promise to analyze your blood on their machines when actually Kia is making the tests?   Did Tesla promise shareholders/bondholders that it was building a Model 3 production line in Fremont, when in fact, it wasn't?  Was the Gigafactory producing tumbleweed and not batteries?You want the SEC to tell those deposit holders that they are not going to get their vehicles because Musk made too many promises about dates when production targets would be met?There would be letters to every Congressman, every Senator, and from numerous European countries if the SEC stopped Tesla from making cars...",
"I don't believe the SEC would have a case against Musk/TSLA for Fraud.  The mere fact that Musk/TSLA promised to produce cars (or solar panels or space ships) and actually produced them negates Fraud (in the factum).  The reality that he and his company were inept at production may fall below a standard of due care but it's not Fraud.There may be other false statements that I'm not aware of that amount to false pretenses could be an issue.  I simply don't pay enough attention to Musk/TSLA pronouncements to know exactly how many false representations may have been made.Remember:  People don't read prospectuses so all the WARTS are contained therein.  So, when TSLA gets sued, the response is:  ""We told you about that risk on Page 15, in the very small print"".  And, ""that information was right above where we also said:  ""before you invest any money with us, see your psychiatrist.""  Apparently, you didn't see that or didn't read the prospectus.""Not to worry, TSLA won't be around much longer and the Automatic Stay in BK will protect all the scoundrels for awhile.",
"-- ""Holmes and Balwani were charged 'with raising more than $700 million from investors through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company's technology, business and financial performance.'""I'm guessing is that this means that documents Theranos provided to potential investors contained patently false information.Public pronouncements carry little or no weight in a fraud investigation such as this.  Prosecution of Tesla and its executives will hinge on whether false statements were given in S-1, 10-K, and other filings.  If these documents are righteous, I don't think there is much the SEC can do.",

Your “analysis” is speculative at best and trying to find some thin correlation between Theranos and Tesla is beyond absurd. The article clearly pushes your own baseless opinion in an effort to sway readers away from one of the most technologically advanced companies in the world. You’re talking about the same group of like minded engineers who successfully land rockets on barges in the ocean. This concept seemed utterly unfathomable no more than 4 years ago and today it’s a reality. Electric cars will transform and revolutionize transportation and Tesla is at the forefront. You’re just too much of a bigot to see what’s already happening. You can ‘trash’ Tesla all you want if and only if you have personally made a greater technological impact in the market. I highly doubt this as you cannot ascertain even the most basic of facts to produce an unbiased article.,

Never mind the SEC!Where is NHTSA?Either the masses of complaints about Tesla suspensions are valid and should be properly investigated OR they are false and the persons making those complaints should be investigated by SEC.Simple enough really!,

>barred Elizabeth Holmes from serving as a Director or Officer >of a Public company At least she wasn't launched one-way to Mars.,
"Nicely done, Mr. Wenck.There are powerful parallels between the behavior of Elizabeth Holmes and that of Elon Musk, and no doubt you will have brickbats cast at you by the usual suspects for pointing them out.There is a great deal of evidence that the entire Model 3 narrative was built around forecasts Tesla knew were hugely unrealistic. It was all part of a scheme to raise capital based on phony guidance and empty promises.And, of course, all constantly reinforced with the unending Musk bullshit: alien dreadnought; the machine that would build the machine; machine gun fire battery production; etc.Everyone in the auto industry knew the Tesla Model 3 promises were wildly unrealistic. Every single person I know in the auto industry thinks the man is simply full of it. It's coming out his ears.While losing billions, the Musk clan has done a splendid job of feathering their nest. The SolarCity acquisition was a signal disgrace in that regard.If there is a fraud trial, Musks best defense may be that he is such a sociopath that he really believed all his bullshit. His best expert witness may be a psychologist.As others (including Alberto Zaragoza Comendador) have detailed, the SEC has already done some useful disciplining of Tesla, resulting in, if not exactly transparent reporting, at least less opaque reporting.However, the SEC is spread very thin, and investigating a major fraud requires huge resources. Recall the order of events in Theranos: first the misbehavior was exposed by The Wall Street Journal (and that took a lot of work, as Theranos has recruited respected people to its board which, alas, was supine and sycophantic, much as the Tesla board is), then the share price reacted, and finally the SEC acted.I expect the same order of events for Tesla.",
"wow - so Tesla put guns to people asking for $1k? people did this on their own knowing they can cancel if they want. this is classic jealousy - same thing if done by AMZN no one will care because its retail ;-) and yes you will give pass to VW for their crime. Lets be clear - product development does need capital. companies go IPO all the time with work-in-progress. I am sure lot of us will benefit from drug research that has yet not produced anything. And lets not forget estimates, claims are all that - You are short and you are fuming.May i suggest you do same due diligence on RAD buyout by Albertson?!! There is crime in-progress. Yes you will have done some good there,Tesla company you should be proud of as American company for shining star on world market instead of constant short agenda. Frankly commit to not using any new product, drug or technology and then you would earn a medal - not before that",
"LMAO Kevin.  Simply put, you are delusional if you honestly think the SEC is going to come save you.  If this is what shorts are pinning their hopes on, then Tesla is a huge buy because the  other side is really clueless.",
"Sadly, the SEC is reactive, not proactive, in cases like this. The penalties won’t come until the share price collapses and all the evangelists are singing a different hymn.",
"Here's how I see things going down:1. pretty much every stubborn short will go bankrupt or take serious financial losses shorting Tesla. Afterall, this stock has gone up 20-fold already. 2. Tens of billions in capital will be destroyed when it becomes obvious to even the most ardent true believers that tesla (the whole company) is not worth $3.50Of course this will take years and Tesla will go from manufacturing thousands of cars to hundreds to making only two cars per year (by then a chinese sub-contractor will be making the cars and Elon will just slap the Tesla brand on them).3. The SEC will swing into action and find that Elon Musk and Tesla did nothing wrong. (I'm not saying they did nothing wrong...I'm saying that the SEC will clear them).In the end, people everywhere will conclude that there's no cure for the stupidity of tesla bulls and tesla bears. We can dream that tesla bulls will own a stock that makes a dollar in profit at some point in its first twenty years of operation. We can hope that tesla bears will grasp that markets stay irrational longer than men stay solvent shorting cult stocks. But it's false hope.",
"If is physically impossible the SEC has not been watching/reviewing Musk for months.I think the sole reason the SEC has not stepped in is due to Musk's savior-like status in saving the Earth, and his cult-like, hero-worship by many tech high rollers.Consequently, the SEC has remained in neutral.But that will change, and the tech superstars will drop their interest and support of Musk so fast many heads will spin.Then the SEC and Attorneys General will move.",
"Sadly, the SEC will wait to step in only after investors have already lost their money. The SEC has never demonstrated themselves to be proactive in any way, shape, or form. They always let the market drive the price declines first. Once Tesla actually runs out of cash and files BK, THEN we will see action taken by the SEC.By then Musk will have joined his cousins and other family members in a non-extradition country to live out their days with the $ billions of ill-gotten gains.",

"Another short article?I'm sorry Mr Wenck, but until you make a confirmed SEC complaint this article is just slander against the company I am invested in right now. Your comparison is as poorly done as the comparison to Enron, where the insider stock moves were based on them knowing their company had stolen assets and covered it up until their senior execs could insider trade out of their positions. The Bio company never delivered on their products where Tesla delivered the Roadster, the Model S, Model X, and the Model three that is having the same kinds of growing pains in ramping up production as was experienced and solved during Ramp up of the model S and X. All delayed a bit, all resolved and with very happy owners.Musk has a reputation for executing and delivering what is at first seen as wishful thinking. He is doing multi million dollar US Air Force and NSA launches with his wholly owned Space X which launches for half what the ULA does.What does this have to do with your short story?Simply that he is going to succeed and is already used more three to one than any other launch company. Space X is real, and knocked the ULA aside launching now five to one against that established competition. He makes sure both deliver the goods. Heck, he even delivered a Tesla Roadster to the stars!He has a vested interest in his word being his bond. That was why he told South Australia officials her would bring in their battery project with Tesla Energy on time and in budget or free. It came in on time on budget, and the company made $800,000.00 in the first two weeks selling energy instantly instead of waiting for ten minutes to fire up another plant too late.Tesla is just getting their now in stock Solar tiles installed and the PowerWalls for homes is picking up now that folks are beginning to get it.

The end is near. Facebook no longer possesses anything that a rich group cannot put together. We're already seeing it all over outside the US with highly successful competitors gaining market share. As terrible as the weaponization of FB became during the election along with the other tobacco farmer in a t-shirt malfeasance it pales in comparison to how Facebook works with the oppressive Chinese government willingly. That'll be the next brick to fall. This company's cool has run out and the non-dividend paying stock will be dead-money rangebound for years before the inevitable regulation and bankruptcy.

"Great article. Spot on. I would add that FB no longer needs to grow its user totals or time spent. In fact, they can even shed users. The FB platform is entering its second phase in which the value of its ads increase as the targeting becomes more accurate. In other words, the value of an ad on FB is going to continue to grow for years. Why? Because FB knows more about its users than any other medium and the tools to target them are continually being improved and refined. Everything rides on advertisers ROI. As long as FB provides the highest ROI for advertisers they will continue spending- and spending more. All of the other data points are irrelevant.Finally, the privacy nonsense is just noise. FB’s targeting is a feature, not a problem. Most people would prefer to see ads on products they have an interest in- not those they don’t. FB does not give advertisers your private data. In other words, this is much ado about nothing. Ignore the noise and enjoy the unusual opportunity that has presented itself.",

"To Building IncomeThere is an excellent article on the Bond Buyer Magazine.Commentary : Puerto Rico Hard Case, Destabilizing Decisions by Len Weiser-Varon and William KannelSomehow Bond Buyer Magazine showed the entire article without asking for the user ID.  The article discussed how the PR government, the FOMB, and the bankruptcy judge totally ignored the PR law and the US bankruptcy law.  Perhaps for this reason the stock price for AGO as well as MBI and AMBC are somewhat depressed.Unless congress interfers, I don't see how the insurance companies and the bondholders can win in the bankruptcy court considering the other three parties seem to work together against the bondholders.  Please let us know your response to this article.",
Power generation in PR hit 99.3% yesterday....http://status.pr,
"I completely agree with building income's response.  It seems to me that PR government, the oversight board, and the bankruptcy judge like to drag the bankruptcy of PR as long as possible so the PR government does not need to make any debt payment.  I do not recall the judge made any judgement that is favorable to the bondholders.  Building Income correctly pointed out that PR government and the oversight board prefer spending money on lawyers instead of paying bondholders.Unfortunately it will negatively affect the stock prices of AGO, MBI, and AMBC if PR bankruptcy drags on.  PR government is still unable to produce its 2015 annual report. The governor blames previous administration but he has the job for more than one year.  Surprisingly there are politicians in DC that believe PR problems were caused by bondholders and therefore PR bonds should be forgiven.",

Families with the funds are sending their children to schools in Florida or the cities where they have relatives.  Even though Puerto Ricans are US citizens, our President and Congress don't much care, since Puerto Ricans don't vote in presidential or congressional elections.  The island and its government were more or less bankrupt before the hurricanes hit.  Think about the number of businesses that have gone under without electricity and normal transportation for months on end.  I don't have much to say about AGO, but the company will have this debt hanging over it for a long time.  I am more concerned about the tragedy facing our fellow citizens on Puerto Rico.",
Great in depth article. I had purchased the preferred AGO-PE below par and am happy with that 6+% return,
"Many thanks to Tim Travis and Building Income's responses.  I own AGO, MBI and AMBC insured PR bonds.  After the hurricane last September, MBI insured PR bonds dropped somewhat more than AGO insured PR bonds however, AMBC insured PR bonds dropped less than MBI insured bonds even though AMBC insured bonds have no rating.  Is it because AMBC put more reserve into PR bonds ?",
"A downgrade of AGO’s “AA” claims paying rating would likely destroy share price.AGO Management needs to be ever vigilant and in touch with the ratings agencies to never allow them to downgrade them as PR unfolds.Not sure the stock will regain flight for a while.   Share price was range bound between $20-30 for nearly 3 full years from 2014-Nov 2016 when the market finally was impressed with the massive $3 quarterly earnings figure in late Nov 2016.  As this PR Bankruptcy plays out for what appears to be at least another 12 months, I don’t see how the share price will necessarily rise much, despite the growing value via continued share buybacks and possibly additional corporate acquisitions.Patience patience patience.   Or, maybe Mr Market knows that AGO has not properly reserved for what could be a horrendous PR outcome.",
I own MBI.  Would you make the same case for this stock?Thanks.Grant,
"Thank you for your excellent article.  I believe the reason AGO insured PR bonds are trading near par value is due to AGO's insured bond rating(A2/AA and A3/AA).If PR bankruptcy drags on, there is a possibility that AGO's rating may drop.  If it happens then both AGO insured bonds and AGO stock value can drop significantly even if AGO has no problem paying the insurance claims.Can you share your opinions on this issue ?",

"The microLED problemSo, what’s the deal then? Why linger on inferior technologies, when microLED is obviously better? Well, as with any emerging tech, the answer is “because money.” MicroLED isn’t even all that new, it’s just currently extremely difficult and expensive to produce. Apple bought microLED manufacturer LuxVue back in 2014, and it is just now, 4 years later, that the company is even considering implementing the technology. And no, don’t expect an iPhone with a microLED display this year. Or next. Or perhaps even the one after that.MICROLED PANELS ARE ASSEMBLED ONE SUB-PIXEL AT A TIME. A 1080P PANEL HAS AROUND 6.3 MILLION SUB-PIXELSApple is currently considering implementing a microLED display in one of the future iterations of the Apple Watch, because it would be small, lower-res, and subsequently easier to produce. You see, the problem with microLED displays is that the panels need to be assembled one sub-pixel at a time. Just to put things into perspective, a 1080p display has roughly around 2.1 million pixels. Multiply that by 3 and you get around 6.3 million sub-pixels. And each of these has to be assembled individually. Suffice to say, at this point, building microLED panels in a meaningful scale is not possible.So then, why even bother? Well, aside from all the benefits that microLED has to offer over LCD and OLED, Apple is playing another game. The current iPhone X uses OLED panels sourced solely from Samsung—Apple’s main competitor on the mobile market—while 2018 iPhone models are rumored to use a mixture of LG and Samsungpanels. Apple also uses LG and Samsung displays in MacBooks and iMacs, which makes the company even further dependent on its competitors.Apple will likely start out small with microLED, implementing the tech in one of the future iterations of the Apple Watch. From then, if it turns out to be a viable alternative, the company will have to increase the manufacturing rate. However, getting to the point where microLED panels can be produced on a large enough scale to satisfy Apple’s yearly demand, is still quite a ways off. For reference, the company has ordered around 270 million iPhone displays in 2018, half of which OLED.ConclusionApple isn’t alone in this game. Samsung recently unveiled The Wall – a 146-inch behemoth microLED TV that’s supposed to be available for purchase in 2018. The company still keeps mum on the price tag—because it will be exorbitant—and the TV will be available in a limited run only. It’s more of a showcase, really, but it’s indicative of where the display industry is headed. According to analysts, it will be a good 4 to 5 years until the tech gains traction and mass availability. And even then, prices will likely turn most people away.",

"This article is comparing apples to oranges.  OLED displays are in huge demand but the capacity of display makers hasn’t caught up and for this reason the prices of OLED TVs are still somewhat expensive.  When billions of dollars are shelled out by LG display, Chinese display makers, Japanese Display makers, including Samsung shows they are building up infrastructure to support OLED.  Apple smartphones are not a huge part of UDC business and microOLED is in its infancy at best.  There is no better market ready product to replace OLED in next five years and once blue OLED is introduced the energy and visual differences with microOLED are minuscule... blue 30 percent more energy efficient vs 33 for microOLED. UDC holds over 4K patents and will continue to add to it as older ones expire.  I don’t see how this technology is easily replaceable.  If LG display does well so does UDC and if Samsung does well so does UDC.  It’s the backbone for all display makers.",

"In response to ignorant persons spreading false information...Universal Display and LG Display Sign Long-Term OLED Patent License and Supplemental Material Purchase AgreementsUniversal Display, enabling energy-efficient displays and lighting with its UniversalPHOLED® technology and materials, and LG Display, the world’s leading innovator of display technologies, today announced the signing of a new OLED Technology License Agreement and Supplemental Material Purchase Agreement. The agreements run through December 31, 2022.Today's announcement builds on a long-term relationship between the two companies. Under the license agreement, Universal Display has granted LG Display non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by Universal Display to manufacture and sell OLED display products. In consideration of the license grant, LG Display has agreed to pay Universal Display license fees and running royalties on its sales of these licensed products over the term of the agreement. Additionally, Universal Display will supply phosphorescent materials to LG Display for use in its licensed products.“We are excited to enter into these agreements with our long-term partner LG Display, a global technology innovator who is leading the charge for OLED TVs, evidenced by its recent CES showcase of new 4K models ranging from 55”, 65” and 77” in flexible, curved and flat form factors,” said Steven V. Abramson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Universal Display Corporation. “The growth of our relationship demonstrates the continued acceptance of our OLED technology and phosphorescent materials by the display industry for cutting-edge, high performance, energy-efficient commercial OLED displays. We look forward to the continued collaboration in support of LGD’s advancements in expanding the thriving OLED product roadmap, including the advent of new form factors that redefine what a display can and will be.”“This is a win-win partnership for both companies. We expect this strategic alliance with Universal Display will bring synergies in accelerating the growth of OLED technology, and based on strengthened OLED business, LG Display is committed to deliver differentiated products to customers and the market,” said Sang Deog Yeo, President and Head of OLED business unit of LG Display.Source: http://bit.ly/2FRBM4H",

The technology now is developed to where OLED was 5 - 7 years ago. Apple has invested in micro LED which is really leading the push. Some analysts are saying the OLED screens for the current Iphone could be the last since apple likes to control its own technology. It could be the companies helping to develop technologies like Micro LED (AUO for instance) are where OLED (the company) was and are going where OLED (the company) is now.

Totally different companies and totally different plays. So no goof comparison can be made.,
Thanks for your excellent article. Motley Fool is pure entertainment and is not investment advice.  I subscribed once just to see what they had.  The analysis they do of a stock is very shallow and perfunctory.  An investor would be better off investing in an SP500 ETF than the nonsense that they espouse.,
"My problem with your opinion is with PE. Saying USD is overvalued with a forward PE of 31. Last year USD grew at 64% and the PE followed the growth , with this year anticipated just shy of 3 dollars per share. Next year growth will likely resume and according to the analysts give or take 4.60 to 5 dollars per share.  Certainly wall street will not give it a 15 forward  PE with growth 40-60% or better , then greater when blue comes into the picture. Saying 31 is too expensive now,  is absurdly low.  Same as the past , growth into future years will correlate to PE therefore a 40-60 forward PE by Nov- December can be expected. Hopefully we get the expected 5 dollars/share or better analysts are anticipating and you are  wrong. 200-250 is my guess.",
the articles on motley fool are always horrendous. I was long oled and got out around 180. looking to get back in but since it was picked by TMF I will have to take a second look to make sure.,
"And the chart placed just contradict your opinion. Those who bought OLED, (PANL before) just made a bunch of money, not the same with LG. Unless you are investing for other reason than making money?",
"That's not research, its an opinion. Misleading and badly documented. Compare LG with Samsung. Both clients og Universal Display. Apple Iphones a very small piece of the pie. Oled has been always a volatile stock. They are incorporating blue molecule very soon and going forward in the roll to roll production with vapor deposition. I see a visual revolution around the corner (couple of years?), where you could order your displays by meters depending on the size of your walls, ceilings, even floors so you could be at the caribbean or the swiss alps. And it doesnt matter who you buy from, Universal Display will cash in.",
That table is a bit misleading due to the staggering differences in cost of revenue between the two ...,
"The author of this article has clearly not listened to the Universal Display conference call.  If he had, he would not have written what he wrote. This is the bad part about writers on all sites.  They limit their research.  However, actually listening to the conference call would have revealed enough about the 2nd half of 2018 and 2019 and forward whereas the author would have at least mentioned certain things discussed and I believe come to a different conclusion on OLED.I DID listen to the conference call in addition to all my other research on OLED.  For those who want a highlight of the call, you would find management believes 2018 first half will be soft as they had indicated in guidance.  Things likely to pick up in the second half and then off to the races in 2019 as capacity build-out starts coming online.  As far as upside risks and downside risks. Looking at the entire playing field here it is.  The downside risk is only MicroLED.  So far not in production or commercialized.  Samsung is attempting to commercialize it but as of now not done and expensive.  There are also rumors Samsung may, in fact, abandon MicroLED and QLED and start making OLED/QLED hybrid tv sets.  Right now it is only QLED and no OLED TV's for Samsung.  This is your upside potential.  If Samsung does make the move to OLED TV sets then Universal is way over $200 in a hurry.  OLED charges by total emitters as well as square footage produced (licensing).  As for Motley Fool getting it wrong, I will say this.  They recommended this stock when it was 8 bucks.  I own some as low as $8.  Pretty good return so far.  During my hold, the stock has had multiple large corrections as deep and deeper than the recent drop from 200 to 125.  OLED has always been volatile over the last decade but I've held and made out quite well.  The risks over the next 3 to 5 years are minimal.  MicroLED is pretty much it.  The upside is there simply from continued adoption of OLED screens and lighting.  Samsung going to OLED TV's is just going to be a short squeeze from hell for anyone short.Invest wisely...",

"hangloose Hawaii, It is time to admit that Southwest is coming and it has a giant frequent flyer following. Forecasts of demise are futile.,",
Lots of undervalued stocks in the airline industry right now,
"I would agree LUV is the best airline stock to won, but with LUV trying to expand internationally and try to compete in the Hawaii market, my opinion is they will get crushed in the Hawaii market. Southwest has prospered for years with their sound business plan of flying within the 48 states, and only using 737's. Hawaii is already a saturated market, and the yields aren't high enough for another player to try to take market share. I can almost make a bet any resident in Hawaii will never opt for LUV over their own Hawaiian Airlines. Add in United's strong presence in the islands as well. LUV would  be best advised to stick with what they know, and avoid taking on a fare war. The big 3 are already competing with LUV on price, as LUV is no longer a leader in low fares.  For the stock, I like LUV, but I don't own any airline stock anymore. IMO airline stocks have come close to a peak.",
"I've owned Southwest stock since back when they only flew between three or four cities and didn't go out of Texas.  Daytime flights were $25 and weekend and evening flights were $15 (all one-way).

I swear so many of you make up comments. Even in a down year AMC has increased revenues. The debt can be handled anytime but they finding more marginal profit using it to upgrade theaters. Worst case they get sold at 26$ a share. Plus in a cyclically strong year they also positioned to do better then the others. I won’t be surprised for a big beat this quarter.,
"There are errors all over this page. ""MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe just announced publicly that the only data they have on consumers is their location..."" This is absolutely false. In several interviews Lowe discusses all of the data being collected and how to monetize the movie going experience with loads of different data points. I'd name them off myself but almost every interview with him discusses this exact point.",
Sir.  Anybody who spent any time at all studying what you just wrote about would quickly understand that no single movie theater chain can replicate what MoviePass does.  Also if you studied the ecosystem of the movie industry you would know that AMC can't do the pricing model you recommend.  Do some more research.  The only thing you said that I agree with is that AMC is a good buy for someone looking to go long right now.  Why?  Because of the upcoming summer movie slate AND the MoviePass effect.,
"Before moviepass i would go to maybe 1 movie a year. Too much of a cost andtrouble when i can just stay home and watch Netflix. Now with moviepass i go to about 2 movies a month and spend money at the concession. If moviepass fails i will go back to my regular 1 movie a year average and it will cost AMC and Regal.  AMC should deal with moviepass because they bring customers into the seats which has been on a steady decline. And if moviepass fails now do you think people paying $10 a month will still go to the movies at $14 a movie, very doubtful. And if its so easy to duplicate moviepass (as they are the first mover in this area) why don't others just duplicate Netflix?",
"Why would Netflix EVER take over a theater business from AMC, one that is loosing money and carries tons of debt ?? Makes much much more sense for Netflix or AMZN to buy MoviePass...not so much to make a profit from the subscription, but to complete gain control over the entire movie industry. Can you imagine the headlines, and fear that would spread across the movie industry if Netflix or amazon controls not only film content in video/ TV, but also having complete control over which studio movies they want to pay for, and where?  Studios would have to bow to them. NFLX or AMZN would have the cash and ecosystem to easily surpass 10 million movie pass subscribers and profit solely on tickets and product / ad sells alone. Like or hate MoviePass, the company freaken stinks right now due to all the dilutions. BUT, if, and it's a big IF, they can get pass all this and hit 5 million members, it would be hard to ignore them and they will indeed be a force to be reckon with. Of interest, Netflix was $4 a share during the early years, and Blockbuster was offered to buy Netflix for $50 million!  Ouch.",
"I have been watching 1 movie per week for the last 3 months at AMC, thanks to Moviepass.I think Netflix going to takeover AMC and cut down the movie ticket prices to $5.",
"It may be worth a trade from something to something, but i generally disagree with buying AMC like I disagreed back in Oct when you wrote your other article. But best of luck. There's still way too much debt, debt and rent expense, capex upgrades needed, no retained earnings, -$21 or so tangible book, Dalian Wanda full control ownership voting rights ETC.Plus, Movie Pass might die one day, and pent up demand to see movies might decline again.",
"Moviepass is a branded Mastercard giving free money to the cinema industry - all financed by disillusioned shareholders. It won't last more than 1 year and the comparisons to Netflix really gotta stop. If a monthly subscription is all that is needed to make The Netflix Comparison, then I guess that my gym subscription is a Gymflix. Long AMC.",
"Your creativity is appreciated, but you really need to study the economics of the motion picture ecosystem.  Who is supposed to take the massive hit from $3 first run feature films?  The studios?  The exhibitors?  The landlords?  All of them combined, just so you can watch films for next-to-nothing?The reason that Moviepass is destined to fail is because, fundamentally, each consumer paying $10/month to see multiple films just does not — in the aggregate — generate enough revenue to support the system.  Particularly with Moviepass adding another profit center to take another slice of the pie.",
"Moviepass's strategy seems to be gaining as many subs as possible and then trying to blackmail AMC and Regal into a slice of the concession sales. Moviepass is a fad, laden with incredible debt, and the only profits they derive are those paying for it and seeing less than 1 movie per MONTH.",
"Can't believe what I just read. You are suggesting AMC to follow Moviepass's model of $10/month for 1 movie per day. If you did any research on Moviepass, you would know they are only using this price model to accumulate subs quickly, but at the cost of very, very heavy cash burn.",Ride The Roller Coaster And Buy AMC Entertainment

Venkat is right, flying under the radar is sometimes a very good strategy, rest assured Macy's would not be opening BM locations at the rate they are planning to if the dollars were not coming in from the operation as a whole. Also, don't encourage your competition by big-noteing yourself either. Each part of Macy's if it is being properly managed, has to support, justify itself, and be a 'profit centre' in it's own right. M is not going to jump from the frying pan back into the fire, in other words, the last thing they want to do is start putting money hard won back into failing strategies, again. That is why they have closed close to 100 locations, with a few more to follow over the next several years. The business, on the margins anyway is changing rapidly. Hard lessons have been learned, I believe. As to how busy or how quiet an individual BM location is at any given time, that's not really relevant. the key is overall sales vs. budgeted sales. That is relevant.",

"I'm a holder (will be LONG-TERM) of Macy's shares with 4 dividends now also reinvested in a DRIP. I sent Jeff Gennette an e-mail just after the quarterly report and conference call. I commented that I thought it was amazing that not one analyst commented or asked a single question about the most Amazon-resistant part of the business. You guessed it: BlueMercury. Jeff was so prompt to reply to me and explain the plans that Macy's has for BM going forward and that the Becks, who founded the business were still intimately involved with it, which is great. People are time poor these days and love the idea of being pampered and looked after when they enter a store. BlueMercury, with it's store size and attentive staff can offer this opportunity and customer focus. I would imagine the vast majority of customers who enter a BlueMercury store are women, however, it would be interesting to know if traffic amongst men is increasing as well. BlueMercury, in my opinion, is such a great drawcard for Macy's and has a tremendous quality, it is experiential and a positive hands-on experience for the customer will keep them coming back over and over again. Jeff himself is a great retailer who sees and understands very clearly what it will take for Macy's to return to retail preeminence, don't worry folks, he and his team will succeed in this endeavour. He is a class act in my opinion.",

"Macy's just keeps showing you more reasons why the stock price today is absolutely ridiculous! They do own a department store, of course, and it does produce a very high profit margin and nice cash flow. But besides that: real estate is worth at least $20 per share. Blue Mercury is worth $15+ share and then the department store still produces cash flow and very high profitability. Let's not forget their on line store is showing 20% annual sales growth too.Then they will redirect the cash flow to paying off high interest rate debt and that will add even more margin. This company is worth a bare minimum of $40.",

Why is there no mention of what the company has done the past two years to get earnings to $3+ in 2016 and 2017? It wasn't operational, but one-time accounting ""events"".Back out the gain on bargain purchase (the acquisition) in 2016, and net income before taxes was $101M. Net income before taxes in 2017 was $79M. That is a fall of 20% from an operational perspective. Investors who look at the bottom line and convince themselves that the company has performed wonderfully increasing EPS from $2.21 in 2015, to $3.24 in 2016, to $3.66 in 2017 are have had the wool pulled over their eyes.Grocery companies do not deserve to be trading at 20 PE's, 10-12 is more appropriate. Over time, expect WMK to get to 10-12, a true 10-12.",
"I think the article is mostly fluff. It only scratches the surface with little in the way of providing details or a thorough analysis.I'd love to provide my take on things, but the items pointed to in the article are so high level and superficial, I'm finding it difficult to respond to any of them specifically.Margins are deteriorating, even in the face of higher sales. The issues causing this are not things that are somehow going to change for the better quickly.I suggest potential investors go and closely review the 10-K posted on Thursday, and compare with the 10-K from last year. Closely review the income statements and where the company is having issues. Then look at the discussion regarding what the company has concerns about. 2017 performance was hurt because of items indicated as concerns in the 2016 10-K.The share price today is the same as 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, and 30 years ago. This should tell you something - and it's not that the company is on the verge of greatness at this time.You can count on the 30 cent/quarter dividend, maybe they will even increase it to 31 cents later this year. Beyond that, there really isn't anything to look at here. As I mentioned elsewhere, the dividend yield thesis is quickly disappearing with the Fed continuing to increase interest rates. Risk averse investors can lock in 3% yield with 5-year CDs today, by year end 5-year will yield 4%, and not have any principal at risk.WMK shares will likely meander between $30 and $40 for the remainder of the year.

"Not unexpected, but presents some challenging questions. Management states that this amounts to a change of control. GP removed, bond vote to amend terms, etc. Change of control gives preferred the RIGHT to convert, not obligation, yet management is only offering preferred the rock bottom for a conversion ratio. Furthermore, it may not be a bad deal considering EV/EBITDA ratios of peers, but there is no guarantee against further dilution. In fact, further dilution is foreshadowed by setting up debt for equity swap provisions with bondholders and GSO. Hard to imagine management taking such a hard line in negotiating swap ratios with bond holders and GSO. Giving those parties a sweet deal will screw holders of both the preferred and common. On top of all this, insiders exited their preferred positions at higher prices, moved into common at bottom prices, and we still do not know the full nature of Baines creek involvement in the behind the scenes action, along with the very real tax implications. This could get ugly legally, but something has to be done. The question is: is it reasonable, is it fair to all ?I laugh at those here that say these actions will be shunned by markets. If the stock is listed there will be willing buyers and sellers. All anyone really cares about is whether or not this is beneficial to themselves, either financially, or to their image on these boards. Anyone claiming otherwise is a liar, to themselves, and the community here.We need to know, and management needs to be very forthcoming, about future plans to issue additional equity. We need to know Baines connection to insiders/ New Legacy. Offering rock bottom conversion ratios while keeping people in the dark is no way to get people to go along. It is how you get sued. I am long LGCY, LGCYP, LGCYO, and still hold options. I think the company has great assets, and is capable of efficient execution to increase value, and if feel good about commodity markets. Nevertheless, I can't form a judgement about future value, or make risk/reward estimates. Gonna be interesting 2018.",
"I kinda hope I'm wrong on this as I hope LGCY attorney's didn't mess this up too much.I'll mention in case someone can confirm.An advantage of the upstream LP was that they could accrue the preferred dividends.  In essence, I say I will give you (preferred shareowner) a dollar some time in the future, but for tax purposes I will say I paid the dollar today and write it off.  You (Preferred share owner) will say you received a dollar you didn't receive and you will pay taxes on the dollar.  This is allowed their current entity and MLP.  As I remember this is a very special provision for MLPs.  After merger I don't think this will be allowed anymore.I'm wondering how skilled the attorneys are in finance.1.  The obvious problem that they wrote off payments they never made.  Assuming this can somehow be reconciled there still is another problem.2.  Preferred shareowners have the right to convert.  They do not have to convert.  Assuming they do not convert, then the company will possibly have a problem.  Per contract they will still owe the unconverted shareowner 8%.  Under new incorporation they will not be able to not pay it and write it off at the same time.  At this point they will be better off paying the preferred owner their 8%.  This will force them to negotiate with preferred owner to get the preferred owner to convert.  Preferred owner who waits longer may be able to negotiate higher conversion rate that what is stated in today's release?Great topic if someone wants to research and write an article on the Preferred, I think.  What works as strategy for takeover of normal companies may be complicated by the special MLP tax structure?",

I may be pursued to relinquish my holdings for a lousy 3 shares but for 1.72 i'm gonna keep them. I can't see how they can convert me without me agreeing to it.,
"Sorry, didn't poof read - 2nd part DOES NOT say it is pursuant to partnership agreement - which is my point - they would have said it - it's not an error that they didn't say it.",
"I finally had time to read and think.  one observation.  Per article...LGCYP and LGCYO, respectively) will be converted into the right to receive 1.9620 and 1.72236 shares (pursuant to Legacy's partnership agreement) of Common Stock, respectively, with any rights to accumulated and unpaid distributions being discharged and the Preferred Units being cancelled.  Got to love attorneys.Note that the 2nd part about discharging the preferred has the part (pursuant to Legacy's partnership agreement) omitted.  Believe me....this is not an Error by the Attorney.  IF they could have said it they would have said it.  They apparently know this isn't a slam dunk.IN the end - if it makes the company healthier then the preferred owner still benefits.  I never expected to really get $25 per share and $4.5 of accumulated distributions...etc.  but expect to get more than it is trading at today if LGCY at $5.I'm sticking around for 3:30 call - see what the timeline is, etc.Your right that there is also some good news to this announcement.  I really hope that who they hired for the Legal knows what they are doing, otherwise this gets too messy and nobody benefits.Thanks for your perspective of the cup half full on this one and not to panic.",
"Yes.  There is bound to be some short term weakness as technical traders lock in profits on the announcement but, to me, the fundamentals(because of this transaction) have finally turned the corner  and the stock will re-rate.  I still see roughly 50% upside from these levels.  That incentivizes me to go through the hassles of the restructuring process.",
"Through this transaction, Legacy finally leaves the land of the walking dead.  With the elimination of the preferred's liquidation preference, they will finally have access to the equity capital markets to pay down their leverage ratios to more healthy levels. I wouldn't be surprised to see GSO exercising their right to 50%  of those new rights issues, when they occur.  By paying down leverage they can then refinance the existing debt packages and extend maturities.  They will finally be a normalized C-corp with a future rather than the zombie of the past 3 years.  When the market sees that they are a survivor, they can move away from the current 5x TEV to a more normal 8x.  At that point, it is likely the stock price is between 7 to 8 dollars a share.  As a pref holder, do I wish the conversion ratio was better? Yes.  But I would rather go through this process than a potential Chapter 11 where the more senior positions potentially wipe the preferreds out via a lowball PV-10 valuation.",

Kinda makes you wish you had LGCYP at this time instead of LGCYO,
The run up in the common actually takes some of the sting out of the dissolution of the preferred. The preferred proponents have been griping about the perceived discount to the common which has now worked in their favor. Should be thanking the Baines guys who probably also had to swallow a lot of now lost accumulated dividends. Common should do very well going forward now.,

LGCY announces merger and pulling fast one on preferreds. Scumbags to the 100% degree.,
"Fliper, I think the preferred is trading about where it should be. Even though the partnership is on a great run - citing 2017 actuals and 2018 guidance - it still has major balance sheet problems to work out. Obviously bank debt has to come first - then the 2L because of its high cost and the notes covenant - then the notes in 2020 and 2021. The preferred, with their zero cash cost, lowest effective interest rate, and no covenants, maturity or teeth to speak of, save for a requirement that the units can’t get a distribution until the preferred is paid up, will be the last to be dealt with. I reckon that could be 2022. How about 4 more years of phantom income. Ouch. So, that is maybe $8 more - figure after tax value of -$3 - then the uncertainty - I own the notes and units, but no way preferred!Some think that the preferred may have teeth in that LGCY can’t issue more units or do a debt swap - but I don’t think this matters if they meet 2018 guidance. They won’t be paying a distribution for years anyway, if ever, and management, which owns a big piece of equity is reluctant to dilute. If they keep up the progress, they won’t have to.",

Baines isn’t a “holding company”.,
Daniel - Can you list one example of a second lien ever converting to common before the preferreds? Thank you.,
"Starting to think Baines is a holding company to secure stock for the company, as they are restricted from buybacks until the deferred dividends on the preferred are cleared. Reserves will see very significant increases this year, that along with greatly increased ebitda will make extension of debt maturities much easier. Conversion to c corp removes mlp requirement to distribute all the free cash, this becomes capex. I believe oil is getting ready to make the next leg up, and things are going to get interesting if it does.",
"Using NYU Stern’s  EBITDA Multiple average of 10.56 times, the range of Total Per-Share Value (using your analysis) is between $11.63 to $22.33 for the common stock.   LGCY closed today at $3.85  An implied upside of 3 times to 5.8 times.The preferreds (LGCYO & LGCYP) closed today at $7.30.  Your best value for the Preferred is Par Value of $25/share plus accrued distributions of $4.42/share for a total of $29.42 (an upside of 4 times).Don’t the preferreds seem like a better risk/reward?",
"Daniel, are you still long AREX or did you change to short or sell off position?",
"Back to the EBITDA, kool-aid, free cash flow issue that has been flogged by multiple posters in other comment threads about LGCY.  Less than 10% of capex is spent on “maintenance capital expenditures” vs development capex. So, for 2018, with no debt maturing, why not spend all available EBITDA on low risk, already proven high yielding wells. Especially considering you already own the land and are, in effect, simply monetizing your own valuable assets. There is a lot of this excess ebitda for 2018 given guidance of about 330m and interest cost of less than 100. So, it is my view that this “investment capex” is purely arbitrary in that management can decide just how much they want to spend drilling and thus how much free cash flow to generate. So, since the investment capex is arbitrary, they could generate quite a bit of free cash flow in 2018 - but why? This is one of the best management teams, pound for pound, in the Permian and I think they made a wise choice given the high returns and no debt maturities in 2018. With the greatly increased ebitda look for another massive rise in PV10 as of year end 2018 - last year’s was almost 2x! This will go a long way toward smoothing a refi of bank debt in mid 2019 which will set up more opportunities including possibly paying off the 2L entirely. Dan is right to point to EV/EBITDA. 7x should be very doable if they meet guidance for 2018.",
"Dan,I won't expound on the silliness of this article and conclusion. But first off EV is not $1.69b, it is $1.3b debt+ $280m preferred, plus $290m market cap or $1.87b....forgetting ARO's of $270m.",
bad day to write this article with the MLP sector in full panic mode,
Any thoughts on the value of LGCYO?,
"Assume they do convert the 2nd lien to equity. Standardized measure is only 1.17 billion. Less than debt outstanding.  They can convert that 2nd lien to equity and get them about equal. But then they still have ~$500m of bonds due in '20 and '21. However, standardized measure was calculated using prices of f $47.79 per Bbl for oil and $2.98 for gas. I guess if oil holds 60 that might get them where they need to be to refinance those bonds.",
"Daniel,I have no assets left. All I have is a colateral for my bank loans. Unsecured creditors can give me debt at  20 % with 3 years maturity.   I play roulette very well. Starting a common stock soon. If you give me some money I promise to increase my EBITDA based on high leverage and very high interest costs. Will keep the EBITDA ratio as low as you like. Are you a buyer of my bussiness?",
"Daniel, Is using EBITDA as a valuation metric for a company with severe debt problems the right thing to do?  I feel like lots of oil companies that went bankrupt over the past 3 years had decent EBITDA.  I know you wrote articles on companies like BBEP, LINN, VNR, and MEMP so do you remember their EBITDA 0-2 years before filing for BK?  If you would care to reshare that analysis, it would be great.And in your probable scenario, why would people convert their bond over at today's price for only half the company?  These shares are highly volatile and they could easily be back down to $1.5 if a ton of supply hit the market.  I assume bond holders would want most of the company (>80%) in exchange for debt and interest reduction.  Otherwise they could just go to court and get what they are owed from the assets.",

The Russell 3000 reconstitution starts on May 11th and isn't complete until Friday, June 22nd.  And they only do this process once a year.   Naturally, they do have stocks leaving the index throughout the year due to mergers and buyouts.   And they add IPOs throughout the year.  LFIN was added as an IPO last week.  But based on their float as a percentage of total outstanding shares, they will not qualify to be included come the final reconstitution on June 22nd.   Will dig into this further tomorrow.   My best guess is that when the preliminary risk comes out on May 11th, LFIN will NOT be there.   And when the final list comes out on June 22nd they will NOT be there either.

Does anyone know how I can find out when Longfin's insider lock up expiration is? I checked Edgar and it wasn't listed. I'm guessing it is likely 180 days like most IPOs but I wanted to double check to make sure. Makes a big difference on whether to buy June or September options,

The issue with Longfin is that everyone knows the company is either worthless or at least worth much less than its current $4 billion market cap.  Shorts think they have a lock on the stock dropping and they will ultimately be right...but in the mean time the tiny float (1.1M - 1.5M shares) makes the stock extremely volatile.  Pushing the stock up can really squeeze the over-confident shorts.Certainly many of the shares covered can be available to borrow by someone else wanting to go short and eventually the people buying for whatever strategic reason won't want to hold LFIN at its excessive valuation.  However in the short term there is going to be some pain--I just don't know if that pain in the short term will be felt by the shorts or the longs.,

This is a home run for venkat as he get 5mm and all these cash as Hudson convert. And another 26mm if Hudson excercise warrant. What kind of world is this lol,
"Nice article.  I waded through the 8-k yesterday.  I am under the impression that there will be 6 equal installments on the repayment, one every 3 months for 18 months from the date of the agreement.  It is notable that Hudson Bay also received around 700,000 warrants at $38/share (possibly the motive for the recent pump).  Also notable that LFIN received only $5MM cash and $42MM, 30-yr promissory note, for $52MM note to Hudson Bay.  Not only is there, seemingly, a free $5MM in Class A stock under the LFIN note, but it also behaves like an option to Hudson Bay on the $42MM balance.  CEO and stampede are effectively locked out until this agreement runs its course.  Could see this drag on for a while.  Looking at Jun and Sep puts.",
"also, is it may 1st? initial issuance date is not defined in your link. Closing date seems to be late feb",
"There's some conflicting information around, not from the article but in general, about when Longfin's annual earnings are due to be filed.  Previous Longfin filings almost arbitrarily use December 31st or March 31st as the fiscal year end.  Per Longfin's JOBS act Reg A+ status, the company should file form 1-K within 120 days of their fiscal year end.I did e-mail Longfin's CFO yesterday and he cleared up the fiscal year and filing due date information for me.  According to him, Longfin's fiscal year ends 12/31 and they will be filing their annual report within 90 days of the FYE (presumably by April 2nd since March 31st is a Saturday).My guess is that an earnings report will take some of the wind out of Longfin's sails.",
"Regarding the conversion, do you see that as monthly $3.5mm for 15month(start at month3) at whatever conversion price At that time? I.e if stock is $7 then Hudson Bay get 500k share for sale?",
I guess they can also get some free profits from warrant before playing the convert/dilution game,
"Another question, what do u think of hudson bay warrant? i read they can buy 700sK worth of stock @ 38 something. why would they allow this to fall below that price until they excercise?",
"Good article but you're not going to convince anyone that Longfin is wildly overvalued...because everyone already knows that Longfin is wildly overvalued.The sky-high borrow rates and the highly skewed option pricing testify that everyone knows that Longfin will eventually drop...but there's a good possibility that short sellers won't make up their costs by the time the drop does occur.  The put option prices are also extremely high and the call options have very little and often no premium.  A person could buy deep-in-the-money April $65 puts and LFIN would have to drop almost 20% in one month just for that option to break even.If anyone is actually holding LFIN stock without being paid for holding, buying call options instead could literally give an absolutely free hedge to the downside while maintaining 100% of the upside potential.  Nobody should be holding Longfin shares unless they're being paid a good portion of those borrow fees.",
I think it’s really the big hedge funds hoarding those 1mm free floats. Until there are substantial more float available. It’s gonna be a painful squeeze on retail small guys. No one on this planet think this is a 3bn cap company but the squeeze is real,

Why would you be worried about TCPC in a rising int rate environment all else equal?  They double their NII if rates jump 200 bp.  Of course you should hold on.,
"The historical risks of BDCs has been covered by some of the posts.Another new possible threat is the loosening of rules on banks participating in leveraged loans, which mean the competition for the better lower rated companies may heat up. If anybody read my post since the summer, which I doubt, the fall in BDCs, REITs etc. should not be a surprise. These types have been purchased since 2009 as bond substitutes. Now, as long term yields begin to move up, prices on these stocks were guaranteed to decline in the short term as investors react. The eventual fall in prices was inevitable, though timing is always a question. Knowing this would happen I sold all of my REITs, which with all due respect, in my opinion are overvalued (I am only a lowly commercial appraiser with 35 years of experience so I can't blame you for going on to the next post) and sold all of my bond equivalents except two, the Blackstone BDC and TCPC. The first I bought because of the long term speculative gamble, but that's for another article. I kept TCPC because I purchased it at a lower price when I first read a Buzz article that mentioned not only what this author writes about, which is a welcome update, but also that TCPC were expanding the SBA business. At the time I surmised it would increase the comparatively sounder end of their business. In hindsight, it may give them a better chance to compete with banks in general. I knew the price of these two would decline, but the dividends would help goose up my earnings as I switched, actually starting last December, to energy, banks, and pharma. My personal opinion is that you have to understand the risks involved if you purchase TCPC now, though I also understand the short term positive call: rising income offsets higher rates. You be the judge, although if you are an “anyone but Trump” the latter positive scenario will be  due to the Trump tax cut.",

"Interesting article.""Most of a stock's return is related to both the market's movement and the sector it is in.""I think this is likely to more be the case over shorter time periods when a sector might be ""hot"".  As Apple is a high percentage of your portfolio you of course know how much the stock has appreciated over the years.  Most or this was not sector related but what Apple was doing specifically.  I can think of numerous additional examples in my own investing history where this was also the case (PCLN, AMZN, CPRT).  I think it is actually easier (but not easy) to identify long-term winning stocks based on each specific company situation than it is to move in and out of sectors at the right time.  But that's just me.",

"I don't go for individual stocks, I have no opinion on AAPL. But, investors should not try to time the market, instead they should focus on the long-term trend.

I bought and sold LUV a few times and made out decently in both cases. In S'west's case, i think I understood that the stock price was a little deflated at the time. Were I to own 2000 shares of AAPL, as you said you more or less do, Mr. Boyd, I would hold tight. Or, if I thought long-term prospects were not good, I would sell a big chunk of my shares. My own read is that Apple is undervalued, so barring a massive correction or a nuke war, I believe Apple at 2000 shares is a Hold. Enjoy.",

Soon, Apple will release new products, or substantial upgrades or repurposing of current products or product classes.  For example, a watch that can quickly and accurately measure blood sugar, and announce high or low levels, will have a huge demand.  If Apple gets there first, demand, likely in the hundreds of millions, will exceed that of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac added together.  Just one example.",

If AAPL does well with this policy - i.e. maybe do significant boost to yield (3%) and provide a better payout ratio (currently something like 28%.

I still would like to see a special dividend since I would like to see some CASH immediately!After April I agree with Author - I will look to sell some covered calls further out with a good return. If I get called out I would at least be selling at a significant profit. Though my goal is balance return versus the chance to never get called out. My goal is to own AAPL for the next decade or more. I sense that a large shoe is going to drop, and a lot of people will be holding the poop bag. For one - this stock market run has gone on for way too long - we are due; I believe there is a mini-bubble for a lot of tech stocks (AAPL not being one of them); the geo-politic environment is horrible (Trump is an idiot that will destroy the US economy, or get us Nuked - besides he's going to be Impeached or leave within the year).

Thanks Steven.,
I'm just jadded and take every word that comes out of AA's mouth with skepticism.    Something caused him to change his verbiage from shareholders to stakeholders.  He has always been big on pushing the shareholder value creation narrative as primary goal.   Now the objective is to consider all stakeholders.  Just dont see how that can be good.  Maybe just overly sensitive but I doubt it!,
"guns. I hope your wrong this time regarding a change in wording from shareholders to stakeholders. I believe they are one and the same but it was a Change in wording. I don't see how his wording it is of any use to either shareholders or creditors. unfortunately some of your prior predictions have came true and we all need to be cautious here. if he had not pumped up the forecasts and told us how great things were and then flip in less then 3 months, I would respect his decision to get rid of the overhead that the sales and marketing were taking without the faster traction that was needed to make it worthwhile. my bags are full of this disaster and I'm about to take the loss but gonna try to wait out at least some resolution to to sale or licensing of the zonitivity and yosprala assets.",
"I think that IF, and that's a big ""IF"" we receive postiive news of the divestiture, then the stock will rebound big back to $1+.

Time will tell, but if the assets do get sold and focus is placed in the Canadadian biz with decent Toprol revs, than shorts will get killed .. lot's of variables still at play.",
sounds as if a market cap of 30 million and annual sales in 2018 of probably approx 110 million is cheap. however the lack of transparency and lies are killing this company. these are experienced managers and to think they think can obtain a good result with the BS is shameful. I would like to hear if anybody else has an estimate of the cost of goods on 110 million? what are new projected G and A. and what other expenses need be considered besides debt service. do we have any thing left to bottom line?,
that's not constructive. if you have something insightful that is use to others on the board then state it. you sound ignorant with that comment. most here have investments in the company and appreciate both good and bad comments. don't add stupid comments which have 0 value . if you are upset about loosing money here then join the club. do some insightful DD so we can all benefit,

There is something going on behind the scenes that shareholders are not being told.  Am convinced of that!  Could be that Deerfield is calling the shots now as some have suggested.  We won't know because co is not transparent and CEOs credibility has been ruined after having to pull his glowing 2018 guidance offered only 8 short weeks ago.",
Did Moelis advise them to make this change?  I assume yes but that couldn't have happened overnight.  Adrian had to know more about the financial trouble in march when he told us there was enough cash to fund operations for at least 12 monts.  If the company was going to be a profitable growth co with $140 to $160 in revs with increasing EBITDA and sifficient cash as AA said then no reason to change.Cant believe he hasn't made a statement about the stock crash like he did a year ago in attempt to shore up confidence.  Speaks volumes to where his mind is.  He cant claim to be this tremendouse leader with integrity seeing what has now transpired.   I'm sure attorneys are telling him not to comment (maybe one of Steven's lawyer buddies).   Now that the old tribute assets will be the primary growth engine (good luck with that)) maybe they can change their name back to Tribute and Mr. Goldman can get his board seat back.,
I can only assume that AA had his hands tied by Deerfield. To avoid BK this change in direction was necessary. The stock crash will only stabilize once the company issues a PR that Zontivity+Yosprala will be sold for $X .. This is really the only glimmer of hope that will stop the bleed and bring some assurnace that BK is avoidable.,
Stock down 20% more...Look like market is firmly pricing this as bankrupt,
"Well you have to give management credit for keeping a secret.  The stock was up seven cents the day before this announcement on several hundred thousand shares.  While there were some warning signs, like dwindling cash, the CFO departure in November, and the CCO in March, management has clearly misled investors.  This decision was likely being considered for several months and not a word was communicated to investors during the last conference call less than two months ago.  In fact, they just reiterated that they had enough cash for the year.  I find it hard to believe that suddenly a generic competitor appears for Toprol and this caused their decision.  I think it’s more likely that they’ve been unable to refinance their debt and there weren’t any buyers who wanted to take on their debt for these assets.  Wonder how long it will take for the lawsuits to begin?",
AA has some explaining to do.  Cant reiterate guidance 8 weeks ago and tell us in 2018 Aralez would transition to a profitable growth company with enough cash to fund operations for at least 12 months but now significant risk of bankruptcy soon.  People made investment decisions based on that guidance.  I wanted to believe in him too which was a mistake.   Time to demand answeres!,
Textbook example of over promising and underdelivering.  My thesis about the CEOs forward looking projections artificially inflating the share price were dead on.   Management didn't deliver so shareholders were wipped out when it came time to produce results.    Wanted to believe in the CEO like so many here.  I'm a fool for not following my own intuition.  Down with the ship!,

Doubling down on this amazing company.  Shutting down US operations.... what a stroke of genius!   Cut costs, make MONEY!!!!  Forget those pesky salespeople.  They just take away from the bottom line!  ARLZ is a winner baby!  Backin' up the truck!!!!  Woooooohooooooo!!!!!  Amiright or what???",
Anybody holding shares at this point should hold onto them. It probably would be a bad move to sell today,
Game over for Aralez. I got out of it at 1.35 taking a loss from 1.72 a few weeks ago. Take your losses and move on. It’s a junk.,

Mr. Goldman and many of his followers here  thought the stock was undervalued less than 6 short trading days ago.  Ya'll must really think it is unervalued now!  Where did all the Adrian Adams cheerleaders go?  Cant wait to read the CEOs upcoming letter in shareholders!,
"Damn it , market is up ..stock is making new low",
Steven.  can you update us on Fridays script numbers? much appreciated by all.,
can somebody tell me why its back to $1.57,
Weekly script counts don’t matter!  Record numbers last week and what did that get investors?  Steven could post record numbers again today and stock will decline more on Monday.  I’m more curious to read his comment on CCO resignation.  A core premise behind his investment thesis in Aralez is the experienced management team.  Team Aralez has lost two key members in less than 6 months.,
Any Zontivity Rx counts today?,
"As of this post, ARLZ is down ~20% since the day before earnings.  Market has been down generally due to the Trump-effect but come on!",
"I'd like to listen to Mr. Goldman's perspective over first the CFO then the CMO's departure. Agree this doesn't have the best optics, but I tend to lean towards the likelihood of an imminent M&A activity, given Adam's past and timing. Thoughts?",
"Guns, just to clarify, Mark Glickman was the Chief Commercial Officer (not the CMO) who just gave notice last week that he is leaving at the end of March.  I would agree that it is not usually positive to have a CFO departure and now the Chief Commercial Officer depart within a few months.  There are a number of possible motivations besides your negative speculation that it is due to not being able to meet sales targets, not the least of which is a higher salary or better opportunity elsewhere.   It is clear that Mr. Glickman is highly experienced and has the confidence of  Adrian Adams, as they were together at Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, and they continued to work together at Pozen and Aralez.  I have also seen some management “house cleaning” in other companies in preparation for a merger.  I’m not saying that this is the reason, but just stating that there are a number of possible reasons for his departure and some could be seen as positive.",
"'driving the ship in terms of zontivity growth,' lol.  it's funny how you bash all the sales efforts but are so concerned when someone in the sales arena leaves.  can you have it both ways, shouldn't you be applauding his exit when you say how bad they are all doing?  perhaps he knows they will be bought out within 1-2 years .",
Not concerned about CMO resignation?  Not sure I agree with that.  His responsibility was to increase revenue by increasing sales of Aralez products.  He was driving the ship in terms of Zontivity growth.   Why leave if you believe in outlook and feel you can at least achieve the sales targets Aralez offered to investors by the CEO.  Doesn't make sense.  Very troubling!,
Agreed not a good news but we should not be concerned about CMO that much!! ARLZ is not focusing on new drug approval or complicated clinical trial.,
My assumption is that Mr. Glickman (CMO) didn't feel he could achieve the CEOs Zontivity growth targets for 2018.  So much for the experienced management team.  Look forward to reading Steven's reaction.,
"Damn it , Stock is back to 1.60",
"Steven, Any concern about the departure of the CFO and now the CMO?  If I recall, the experienced management team was one of your core reasons for owning the stock.  After releasing another bullish article on Aralez I assume this news was disappointing to you.   I know you are still a fan of AA but sure looks like chaos behind the scenes!",
The CMO resigning is alarming!  No Press release this time.  Just when investors start to regain a little trust this happens.  Typical for Aralez.  You wouldn't think the CMO would be forced out for cost cutting purposes.  CMO leaving on his own at a time when Zontivity is performing well doesn't paint a good picture.   Looks  like chaos behind the scenes.,
you have made some decent arguments in the past however I think you missed the mark on this one. what they did is as common and prudent as eating cheerios for breakfast.  if you were in their exact position i can not see how you would not do the same. they still have plenty of shares and many were purchased in open market which I believe is the most confident type of buy a insider can make.  I would be more interested in the resignation they announced today. although the prior resignation of CFO did not seem to have any ill effects and scripts have powered ahead since then.,
I get that the number of shares sold by insiders was minimal but it is beyond annoying to see this yet again.   When your shareholders are down 80%+ they have no business selling shares and that includes planned sales for tax puposes.  These guys have tremendous comp packages and should pay taxes out of own pocket until they achieve their ultimate goal of creating shareholder value.  Perfect example of greedy executives putting their own interests in front of shareholder interests.,
"StevenSince I followed your articles on SLSDF, I do not see your comments any more?Are you still bullish?",
"Their 'pipeline' at present so to speak are the assets they bought under the premise that they had value and could extract much more value out of them over their lives than had been attempted before. Classic example: Zontivity. Merck is a massive Mega-Pharma as I'm sure everyone here is aware. Don't misunderstand me, $800M is nothing to sneeze at, but for Merck is was not life or death. This is definitely not a 'pipeline' Pharma in the classic sense of the term and ARLZ do not claim to be. This is a company that is trying to be 'accretive' ASAP, generate as much revenue ASAP, to deal with somewhat onerous debt levels. I think Zontivity has exclusivity until 2032 if I'm not mistaken. Adrian Adams is critical for those of you who do not understand because he has: Been There, Done That, Bought The Shirt and found it was a perfect fit! This experience he has had with 4 other Pharmas is pure gold and should NOT be dismissed.",
Does anyone know how long exclusivity is on Zontivity?,
"For $ARLZ, I've acquired some lots, and sold June and Sept calls at the 2 strike.  On average, this has driven down my basis to around $1.35 per share.  If some shares get called away, that will be more than okay.  If those options expire, I might just rinse and repeat...perhaps with higher strikes if/when refinancing seems imminent.",
"Thanks for the updated article Steven.  I thought it was a good conference call and quarter.  I agree that ARLZ is undervalued, but the high-interest debt continues to be a drag, and the cash burn is still a concern.  I think until this issue is resolved, the share price will not fully reflect the positive trend in sales and EBITDA.  The good news is that it sounds like they are working on something now, so it may occur in another quarter or two.  I know the milestone payments to Astra Zeneca were disclosed when they announced the purchase, but I had forgotten about them, and didn’t realize the trigger would be at the current sales level.  Do you know what the graduated royalties and milestones are for Zontivity or the triggers?",
"Not disagreeing with you. Zontivity seems like a winner for this bunch. They needed it as Yosprala was doomed to fail. For me when I am looking to invest in a pharmaceutical company, pipeline is important.",
"Hi Steve,I believe your general thesis and analyses about ARLZ continues to be very true and simply takes up from your comments last November, except:1. Revenues are now that much higher and increasing very nicely.2. Focus is on strong producers for the company, you're not going to win them all, Yosprala was one of those, cut your losses and move on. Adrian Adams did not squib and did exactly that, did not cry over spilt milk. Pipeline for ARLZ would be a distraction as they need to continue to focus on maximising the assets they paid good dollars for (and they are working on that strategy, it seems to me). A good, accretive asset pickup though, would not go astray.3. If EBITDA reaches the levels that AA believes it will this year, these shares are seriously undervalued and the debt issue will definitely be resolved in Aralez' favour over time.4. He is measured, has the qualities needed to run this business and has the runs on the board, so to speak. Being a Yorkshire man, he would know exactly what I mean!5. Long ARLZ for the longer term, now near my original buy price and now has more intrinsic value than ever. Happy to continue holding.",

Hi Steve very thorough explanation.. i will FOLLOW you with sincere hopes of further anylitic stocks in sight .. thanks,
"Steven, what do you see in Aralez’s pipeline that could be a useful revenue generator in the near future?",
"$4 to $6 a share (still, as you say, extremely speculative), is only amazing if you pick up shares at $1 or $2.  Let's be honest here, POZN alone was $6 before turning into ARLZ.If AA is so great, how come he wasted all of that investor money and time with Yosprala?  How could his awesome management team have been so wrong?  What else will they bungle?  If they were so off (like by 99%) with their forecasts on Yosprala what makes you think that their forecasts with Zontivity hold any water? Maybe it's just been two lucky quarters.I wish ARLZ the best like anyone else but there's way too much love for this AA fellow and his ""management"" team.  Investors need to continually apply pressure to PERFORM, not tell them how great they are for losing their money.",
I knew yosprala was going to be a bust. Still too speculative and what’s the pipeline that is exciting. Still smart move with Zontivity give them credit for that.,
I'm cautiously bullish on Aralez again.  Much potential in 2018 and should be on a good trajectory going forward.   Wish I was initiating my position now versus at 2015 and 2016 prices!   All is not forgotten with Yosprala but CEO deserves credit for putting the company on a better path.    Just need to stop worrying about the daily price fluctuation.,

Are you now glad you got involved with it five years ago?Divs no matter how high can't cover for a really deep dive on the price that just lingers many years below water. And takes forever to come back if at all.Can we all agree that BOTH should have been skipped??",
"250FKMI ""is expected"" to raise its dividend...etc etc.  In 2014 they were ""expected"" to raise their dividend 10% per annum forever and said so publicly.  Instead they cut the dividend 75%.  Enbridge actually IS raising their dividend, as you can see from the NASDAQ website dividend history (minor fluctuations are due to CAD/USD exchange rate fluctuations). http://bit.ly/2tWCgoV You can't spend an ""expected"" dividend. (I'm a retiree and dividends pay the bills around here). Granted, ENB has too high a debt ratio right now, and is working through some indigestion from the Spectra acquisition.  And, the whole energy midstream infrastructure industry is out of favor at the moment.  Over the long term, I'd favor Enbridge, a company that delivered a total return of 1200% to shareholders over the past 20 years, according to the total return calculator at http://www.buyupside.com.  In contrast, investors who purchased KMI when it started trading on 2/11/11 are still underwater with a loss of 31% of their capital even with all dividends reinvested!  After 7 years!!  Are you really comfortable investing with a management team that managed to deliver a 31% LOSS to investors when other midstream companies were delivering good returns to their investors?  Incidentally, during the same 7 year period that KMI delivered its 31% loss, ENB returned a profit of 38%, EPD returned a profit of 71%, and ETP returned a profit of 136%.  The same people who dramatically underperformed their peers are still in charge at KMI.  Why would you want to invest with them?Your logic, sir, eludes me.  Long ENB, ETE, EPD, OKE, among others. I took my loss in KMI and  moved on.  Thank God I did:  KMI shares have declined SUBSTANTIALLY since my sale!",
I think the possibility/likelihood of a rollup makes EEP/EEQ a great deal when it finally bottoms out.   ENB can buy these things for 1/2  or more of an ENB share in a deal which will be immediately quite  accretive to ENB.      Until then you get a nice return.,
"250F:KMI solved their problem in 2014??? Have you looked at their results?  Since 12/31/2014 KMI holders who reinvested all of their dividends through 3/16/18 have lost a staggering 57% of their capital!""Thus far in 2018 KMI is recovering""??? have you checked the numbers?  investors holding KMI from 12/31/17 through 3/16/18 AND reinvested their dividends have a LOSS of 12.11% of their capital!  What kind of ""recovery"" is that???  If you don't want to look at the total return calculator at http://www.buyupside.com, just look at the chart!!!",
"250F:a few facts: first of all the holders of KMP not only were hit with capital gains taxes, but also substantial recapture taxes which are levied at ORDINARY INCOME rates as high as 39.6%.Many KMP holders owed taxes equal to about one half of the TOTAL VALUE of their KMP holding.  That's not the amount that was taxable...that was the TAX!  The IRS arrived with a truck and drove off with about one half of your KMP's value!ENB is certainly in the doghouse now, having taken on too much debt for its purchase of Spectra Corp.  Moreover, the whole MLP/energy infrastructure group has fallen out of favor, MLPs and C Corps alike. However, even with the steep decline in ENB's shares, it has outperformed KMI by a wide margin.  KMI started trading on 2/11/11; if you bought it then, AND reinvested ALL your dividends, you are sitting with a NET LOSS of 31% of your capital, according to the total return calculator at http://www.buyupside.com.  If you had invested in ENB that same date, and reinvested all your dividends, even after the recent fall in ENB's share price you have a GAIN of 38% according to the same calculator.  By the way if you had invested in ENB 20 years ago and invested all your dividends, you'd have a return of 1239%!  Exxon's return for the past 20 years with dividends reinvested is just 269%.  No real comparison between ENB and KMI!",
What do you think would happen in the event of a credit downgrade? Current dividend yield is a warning! Board is all over 65 and living in the past and only owns gifted stock having never bought any in the market. No skin in the game. Think GE?CFO has no idea what he is doing and rest of the team only understands pipes in the ground. AVOID!,
"How do these pipeline stocks fund their dividends, is it with debt?Based on the cash flow statement, ENB had 5.0B in net cash flow with 6.3B in capex leading to negative free cash flow and yet they paid 2.3B in dividends.How is this not a future dividend cut in the making once interest rates go up?",
"Michael, I'm going to respond here to an earlier comment of yours and at the same time to several other comments I got regarding the foreign taxes and related subjects.My view of this is as a retired U.S. citizen who's an income investor.I don't have a retirement account and am way past the age for setting those up. Never needed that anyway. And that's for folks who are still working and saving for retirement. I'm way on beyond that.So it's regular taxable brokerage accounts only for me.With that in mind here's the breakdown on the Enbridge dividend.The div rate is C$ 0.6710. That's CANADIAN dollars. Which must be exchanged for US dollars in my account. I take a royal beating on that deal. Incidentally, virtually all other of the some 12 countries whose stocks I have, pay in US dollars. Canada doesn't see fit to do that. That's bad luck if you're a US citizen. And it makes no difference what kind of account you have, IRA, taxable, 401K...es macht nichts in other words. The treatment's the same.What I'm left with after the exchange rate deduct is US $0.5328.That's based on the current (approx.) 0.76 exchange rate.But wait, there's more.That US $0.5328 must be multiplied by 85% to see what you net after the 15% foreign tax deduct.That leaves me with a div of US$ 0.4528.And a yield that's a shadow of what it was. The exchange rate is a 24% reduction plus 15% for the tax equals a 39% overall reduction in the cash before it ever reaches me. And that tax credit they ""give"" you means really little UNLESS you're in what it equates to in the US, which is the 15% tax bracket. Besides, I'd much rather have cash up front in the first place and not on a tax return a year later. And suppose you didn't have any taxable income anyway for a host of other reasons, medical or business deductions or whatever. The credit would be worthless.So for a U.S. citizen Enbridge's dividend is effectively worth only 61% of its stated ""before"" rate. The same is true of all Canadian companies that pay in C$.There are some I've owned such as Canadian Imperial Bank and Barrick Gold that operate similarly, but there I had some trading possibilites and was less concerned about the dividend.I hope that adequately explains the way it looks from this side of the border.",
"According to the total return calculator at http://www.buyupside.com,  an investment in Enbridge, Inc.,with all dividends reinvested, 20 years ago, has produced a return of 1235%.  Rather dwarfs Exxon's 265% return over the same 20 years.",
"If anybody's interested:Covered in todays TD Securities Morning Action Notes was their view on the FERC  ruling as it pertains to Enbridge and TransCanada.Target Price: (CAD)ENB-T: old: $57, new $54TRP-T: old$77, new $$73Return to TargetENB-T:  38.0%TRP-T: 35.1%Recommendation: BuyRisK: Low ""Lowering Target Prices to Reflect Uncertainty: We are trimming our ENB and TRP target valuations to reflect the uncertainty of the degree and timing of any potential negative effect on cash flows from any diminished ability to collect taxes from pipeline customers. Although we do not expect ENB and TRP’s operating cash flows to be immediately materially affected by these recent developments, over time, it could create a headwind to the rate of cash flow growth. In addition, it could reduce the viability of their U.S. MLP affiliates as future financing options, and also slightly increase ENB and TRP’s cost of capital. This net negative development for U.S. interstate pipelines could affect third-party MLPs disproportionately, and therefore create consolidation opportunities for ENB and TRP. To the extent that financial investors such as pension funds and private equity are able to improve their relative cost-of-capital through tax advantages, among other factors, this could dampen the degree of consolidation that ENB and TRP could realize. We believe that this heightened uncertainty warrants a slight reduction in our target valuations, and as such, although we have not reduced our financial forecasts, our ENB and TRP target prices decline by ~5%. Although we expect Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. (ENF) to benefit from any changes in U.S. tax treatment in the medium term, the timing and extent are uncertain but could provide some tailwinds.""",

"Fitz, another good article. I think your political bias is showing. Was Putin influencing the last administration not to authorize the Keystone pipeline and is Angela Merkle in Putin’s corner by authorizing a new natural gas pipeline from Russia?  Wouldn’t Russia’s economy be really affected if Germany decided to buy natural gas from the US and Canada? Of course getting it there requires focused investment.",
"Good summary of Enbridge.  Apart from ""energy"" it has been smacked due to both rising interest rates and fear of further increased or a yield curve steepening which has hit utilities pretty hard recently.  Leading to some concerns about their cost of financing and the need to keep accessing capital markets to fund their projects while at the same time maintaining investment grade status which is a line in the sand for them.  Thus some fears they might back off of their dividend growth target, even though it doesn't move the needle so I don't really see them backing off it for now.  Company is dirt cheap and a great buy here in my opinion on a risk/reward basis.",
"Happy to have owned Enbridge and TransCanada for a decade or so. I have added to both over the last few years. I added to Enbridge a week or two ago, 2015 and early 2016 were some nice low juicy dividend entry points. I will add to each again soon as I enter my semi retirement funding stage. Glad to read that you like it. I would have no idea on how to evaluate it, nor would I care to do so. TRP and ENB operate in a wide moat space. As a team they have doubled the Canadian market returns for me. I hope that continues :) Dale",
Good news!http://read.bi/2FEzGJE,
"Before you take the authors advice about this company, I advise you investigate his previous articles in which he touted this loser. Also note the comments I have made arguing against his ideas in the comments section. His recommendations have resulted in losses of substantial capital had you acted affirmatively to any of them, and yet he continues to pronounce this as investible. Do you own due diligence and examine the track record before buying into this debacle. Since today's action is based upon news, a rebound could occur should the impact be less than currently priced in, but the track record of this management is enough to warrant extreme caution.I am not a subscriber to SA, so my ability to participate in past commentary is limited due to recent changes in their website.",
"I find it ominous that EPD, MMP and KMI have disavowed the FERC decision and said it won't really harm them. And yet ENB is silent...uh-oh",
"How does a company that has the major share of pipeline transportation of Canadian oil into the U.S. perform like this, even as a shortage of capacity exists? Even before today's news Enbridge companies were a collective trainwreck.  EEP/EEQ now trade at their lowest point ever. Midcoast was such a disaster it ceased to be a standalone company. Yet this incompetent Management remains in place and has recently made another acquisition(SEP) that they will surely screw up as well.",
How is ENB down 4.9 % yet EEP is down 17.3% and their bastard child EEQ is down 15.5%?  I guess the market is not so efficient today?,
I read the article and have considered ENP in the past. I was trying to figure out why the stock was moving and then as it dropped further I decided to buy at $30.79. Seems like a rather good value today. Lots of analysts seem to agree with the author.,
"Nice review. I own both, but much more SEP. I added a 1000 shares of SEP today at 34.1, while it was in free-fall- but it did close down ""only"" $4.31. Both of these stocks are touted as wide- moat dividend buys by Morningstar.",
I own Inter Pipe which has all pipelines in Alberta. I am going to take a good look at Enbridge tomorrow. I was surprised at the size of the drop today.  Perhaps people think they will be affected by the bad MLP news. As far as I know this will have no impact on Enbridge. Will likely buy some tomorrow especially if sell off continues.   Down 4.8 per cent today but some of that is because the Canadian dollar went down about 2/3 of one percent.  U.S. buyers remember you are buying a Canadian company and the stock will go down or up as the Canadian dollar moves.,
"Michael,Thank you for this fine in-depth article. I started a position in my IRA recently, and I've been adding to it as it goes lower. Your article makes me feel more confident I'm doing the right thing.",

"I bought some a couple of weeks ago, and added today. I think the tax issue is probably meaningful but the price drop was overdone. Famous last words...",
"Yeah, bad day to profile an investment case for ENB.  I had enough and sold yesterday.  Great yield but big debt, still waiting for state pipeline approval and now the FERC ruling.  Not good!  I can find better options.",
Absolutely crushed today..,
"I am Canadian and long ENF, Enbridge's sister energy partners company, which seems a safer and more conservative play with excellent dividends.   Please Michael, may I have your comment on this alternative.",
"I would agree with the thesis; today's FERC ruling takes value off the subs that ENB owns, which is why ENB is down in turn, but I think long term it's unlikely to diminish what is a great opportunity. ENB has new projects coming on stream that are low risk; and every dollar of debt they pay back both turns into equity AND will likely raise the multiple on shares. So I see this as a production growth/deleveraging situation, which can create fairly powerful returns. EVen if this trades at $55 in 5 years (~12x forward EBITDA), with only 4% dividend growth you get a 12.5% IRR, which is probably at least double the broader markets expected return if you use historical average S&P growth rate in earnings and the slap a 15.5x multiple on it.",
"Michael:Liked this article: I think all your writing is thoughtful and well researched.  But . . . .If the non-controlling holders own 10%, then the stockholders own 90%.  After a 50% appreciation, the n-c holders will have 15% of today's market cap and the stockholders 135%.  For both parties, this is a 50% appreciation on their position.  It cannot be otherwise as long as the 10% - 90% split remains unchanged.Who are these noncontrolling holders and how did they get their stake?  I see this pop up in a lot of companies.  The n-c holders get a share of income and equity but I do not see their  equity contribution.",
EPD just put out a press release that they are NOT affected.  Hope it's true and that ENB can say the same!,
"""Going forward, dividend growth could slow as new projects could face a potential headwind from increasing environmental regulations. That said, President Trump is very ""pro-pipeline"" and his administration has pretty much rolled back every clean air, clean water, and clean Earth regulation at the EPA.""Letting your political bias get in the way of reason--and facts--diminishes your story--and you. Here's the very first paragraph of the article you linked to to back up your statement:""In its first year under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency moved quickly to fulfill several promises Trump made during his presidential campaign, most notably to roll back climate regulations put into place under the Obama administration.""So, President Trump didn't ""pretty much roll back every clean air, clean water, and clean earth regulation at the EPA,"" he ""rolled back climate regulations put into place under the Obama administration.""

I added to my position recently as well.  I think the recent sell off has hit all midstream and utilities with large debt.  It's an inflation scare - meaning institutional investors are wary of a fast rate hike environment on highly leveraged sectors.

"Here is part of the FERC statement. “In addition, the draft Revised Policy Statement instructs oil pipelines organized as master limited partnerships to reflect the Commission’s elimination of the income tax allowance in their Form No. 6, page 700 reporting.

As discussed in the prior presentation, in Item G-1, the Commission is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that addresses the effects of this revised income tax policy on the rates of interstate natural gas pipelines organized as master limited partnerships.I am weak in legalese. My question is this... "" the Commission will incorporate the effects of the revised policy on industry-wide oil pipeline costs in the 2020 five-year review of the oil pipeline index level.""Does this mean the effect takes place in 2020?

"""Canada"" has become a dirty-word in the global investment community of late with it's insane counter-productive special interest group pandering to the point of economic paralysis of it's energy sector.  The anti pipeline protesters in Canada that get heavy media exposure will never get hosed down by water-cannons or tear gas that's for sure unlike USA.  And everything to do with the Canadian stock markets especially energy related is getting dropped by international and domestic investors alike a result.  So yeah Enbridge is a value and dividend investment play right now.  But obviously those who invested earlier are woefully underwater.",

Your conclusions, however, were (are) wrong, as previous commenters have pointed out.  This decision in no way materially affects Micron, but it does materially affect China, imposing a direct threat to the viability of much of the Chinese smart phone sector and indeed many other, smaller companies.  China will want to resolve this quickly before it turns into something very dangerous indeed.  As for Micron, the real issue is Jinhua.  Did UMC/Jinhua steal enough to make a decent current generation DRAM die?  It's possible.  If so, we'll know this time next year, at which point we will see a series of US government measures to ban JInhua product and OEM products that incorporate Jinhua product.  What comes of that is hard to say as it would mark a significant rise in the conflict level between the US and China with potentially enormous consequences for the world economy. One thing for sure.  Even if the theft of Micron IP is ""successful"", it will be years before China can ramp enough DRAM capactiy to replace Micron output.  Micron's 2019 and 2020 are not affected by these actions, but any number of China names including Huawei, Gionee, Lenova, Alcatel Onetouch, etc woud  be severly crippled.

"What about spreading the risk with an atf like SOXX? I bought MU at $60, but would like to reduce risk. Looks like a bright future ahead for this industry. Thanks",
"I really enjoy the Comments sections of MU, MO, and even AAPL. I go to these threads and I really Feel The Love from Longtime Shareholders. These three companies have created Massive Wealth for their Shareholders.I also enjoy the common theme in these 3 Companies that Someone (or Something) is Coming To Crush Them, as stated many times in many articles. It is amazing that they are as resilient as they are, because they remind me of a Rocky Balboa Type Movie, where Sylvester Stallone (as Rocky) is getting the crap beat out of him by Somebody, and yet he rises to the occasion and overcomes overwhelming pain and obstacles. These 3 companies epitomize the ability to keep from being Crushed and getting “up off of the mat” to fight on. Many Authors and Analysts thought AAPL would be crushed by SAMSUNG; they thought MO would be crushed by The Federal Government; and now MU will be crushed by The Chinese Court System (extension of Chinese Government). And yet they fight on, they flourish, and seem to overcome immense odds. As a Shareholder in all 3, I love taking on the persona of an underdog and it makes Victory Taste All The Much Sweeter! MU is my “Rocky” of 2018! YO! ADRIAN!Wishing Well To MU Shareholders!",

"What is completely missing from this article is the critical information of exactly what the UMC patent allegedly covers as its invention.  I am a retired patent attorney who spent his entire career litigating patents.  In patent litigation, the devil is in the details -- even in China.  It is rare that anyone gets a patent covering a competitor's entire design, as opposed to some narrower or specific aspect of it.  Often that aspect covered by the patent can be easily designed around to avoid the risk of an injunction.  These patent disputes are so hard to evaluate -- really impossible -- without being on the inside and knowing all the details, both of the patent and the accused product.  Yes, it's a risk, but how much of a risk is completely unknown and unknowable at this point to retail investors.",
"Thanks, Russell.  Useful information.",
"Earnings call is in a week.  If they make $3.00 for the quarters as some are predicting, I really can't see a lower price point.  In fact, it may run up a bit in anticipation of another earnings beat.  The TTID (this time is different) theme in their cyclical business is palpable as many think they are extending the cycle through a combination of innovation and a host of new memory intensive applications (e.g. AI, self driving cars, massive cloud growth, etc.).  This is no longer a PC dependent business, and I think the ""cycle"" may get somewhat redefined as the voracious appetite for improving these new applications continues.This is a little pissant lawsuit and while I respect the work you did to bring many details to the surface, it is not practical for such a lawsuit to enjoin billions and billions of dollars and cost both micron and China.  Before that would happen bribes will be paid and little provincial courts (s)quashed.",

"I sold at 46,00 after trump trade war propaganda! Missed the best rally last week, I have to say the only thing that could go wrong is giving the Chinese ammunition to go back on there word of opening their market.  They know they are being criticized by the other advanced economy and they have no choice to open up.  But Trump is alienating most of Americas Ally’s maybe tarrifs would be a good excuse to grab the technology or even impose tax on american goods.  Samsung is already scratched by the recent tariffs imposed on certain appliances.  Maybe they it will strengthen ties between the 2 who knows.  Micron could get hurt big time by a trade war.  Market is not pricing a trade war at the moment but Micron is a potential 10x in 10 years unless major duties are announced i don’t see chips sales slowing down as long as we dont start recycling chips and replace our smartphone every 2 years and don’t need to access data on the cloud faster...faster... faster.  Pricing in emerging market smartphones sales growth and everything MU is a bargain for people who tolerate volatility.",
There's no way they would make them destroy all accused products! It's nice to sit up a write something that catches people's eye but wouldn't it be better to write something that's possible.And if 60% of sales go to China why wouldn't they work out a deal?,

Hard to gauge the possible import of a decision from a court such as this.  I do think the market conditions would make such a decision much more problematic for Chinese companies than for the suppliers of a necessary product that is supply constrained like DRAM.,

"This is totally wrong !! My two viewpoints ; (1) The lawsuit will take years. (2) The injunction will impact China much more serious since 10B USD memory represents about 100B USD end products.

"Not selling a share on a speculative 60,000 ft article.... Raises a few  high level points, lacks high level counter points, and completely lacks detail of issues. Here;s some high level counterpoints:  China's not going to stop DRAM import during critical shortage  and inability to manufacture. Our current administration couldn't be more focused on fair trade and ready to fight over IP issues.As I speak, Larry Kudlow is jaw boning China about  IP on CNBC. So, what about details unmentioned:. There;s a counter case in Calif, and history of Chinese theft of Micron IP thru Taiwan. Both are highly relevant to how Micron addresses demand for $40m. There's no description, or explanation of the author;s understanding, of the IP involved. How does he leap to justify a local court having the rational to leap to an injunction beyond the $20-40 requested? Assuming it;s a rogue court, how does he substantiate the national party would  carry the injunction forward. China's the world;s most aggressive IP thief. Our current administration couldn't be more ready to start a trade war fight over the hypocrisy of a Chinese IP injunction. Beyond detail,  the author weakens his case indicating he bought at $42 (when  same facts of matter were available) and sold at $60. Sounds like a trader to me... not an knowledgeable source of semi conductor IP,  international law, or  foreign trade negotiation and protection. I'll have more of an open mind if the author  explains his trade - but still doesn't provide much detail to scream 'fire' ... whoops in mean 'injunction' ... in a crowded theater.",
so why is the mu down today?  What is keeping it from moving higher?,
"My suggestion is to jump on board and ride the wave as long as it continues to break. Clearly, some of the current price momentum is due to the market already pricing in the impact of next week's blow earnings announcement that has all but been confirmed...however, there is simply no way this stock isn't going higher, at least in the short term. Notwithstanding the recent run up in price, the stock still trades at barely NINE times earnings! Would you rather own Western Digital at 16X earnings?So, accept it for what is, ride it out for as long as possible and be prepared to jump off the wave when the time comes.",
"Trump is telegraphing a trade war with China; China is publicly threatening a response.   Its very  possible that US companies with operations in China or significant sales in China, will see 'roadblocks' put in their paths in the future if Trump follows thru with his trade barrier threats.   That's how China works.   They take a longer term view and are clearly willing to take short to mid term 'pain' to get what they want.   And make no mistake about this - what they want is to dominate in technology.The author points out one potential risk that all knowledgeable investors need to weigh as they invest in MU.   In this environment, it's about more than just company and sector fundamentals.   For me, I happily took my 40% MU run up off the table.",

That 10 Billion in chip sales to China ended going into products and subassembles for products sold right back to us.Is it the premise of this article that China has the capability and capacity to cut off MU imports?Do you really think that kind of move by China would not have consequences to China almost if not more dire than it would hurt MU.,
"So there is not enough chips now and China will curtail Microns business ?I think not my friend, for they would have to go elsewhere for supply and that would starve the non-Chinese market and micron could ""open"" new customers.. The words sound good, but the logic is faulty IMHO",
Hopefully don't let the Bears scare the Bulls. Invest in moderation!,
"It is extremely faulty to short or otherwise invest in a stock waiting on an injunction as the catalyst.  1. Lawsuit against Micron was for a measly $20m.2. The Lawsuit in China was filed as ""retaliatory"" for the lawsuit that Micron filed against the now complaining party in California, USA.3. If ""Injunctions"" and TRO's work in China the same as they do in the USA, then it would have been ruled on already.A) A ""Temporary Restraining Order"" prohibiting a company from doing business is an extreme remedy, where the Complainant would have to show a likelihood to win at trial, and that they are being ""harmed"" in a way that ONLY this remedy can fix.  EVEN if granted, courts here would require a large ""bond"" to be posted in the event that the TRO is not turned into an ""injunction"" in the subsequent hearing.B) It is clear, that NO ""Temporary Restraining Order"" has been, or even has the slimmest chance of being granted against Micron.C) Also, as a matter of course, a TRO is held ASAP and usually within 2 weeks of asking as it is an extreme remedy.  Further, even if the TRO is not granted, the Complainant can still seek an injunction (again, an extreme remedy), and here, in the US, you would proceed to the Injunction hearing ASAP, but surely within a 3 month time.  IF NO INJUNCTION HAS been issued, then the likelihood that one will be issued is NONE.  And they, the Complainant, will merely be allowed to continue with the litigation.Finally, if China wants a trade war, bar the ONLY USA company that sells DRAM (remember, there are only 3, Samsung (South Korea), SKHynix (also a s. Korean company) not sell into China??... good luck.  DRAM prices WOULD SKYROCKET, and that is NOT what the Chinese want... they want LOWER DRAM prices.In summary, nice try author as you will get a slew of responses, but this entire article is premised on a (IMHO) very flawed and risky assumption.Good luck to anyone wanting to short Micron.  MU announces next week, and from their pre-announcement, I am one to think that they are going to CRUSH it (see E. Phred's $3.00 estimate that I agree with for the qtr).  And Micron at $58, is well off of its $64 high (which, I think will be surpassed in the near term).Live long and prosper.",

"Much has been written about the legal system in China, most of it highly critical and about as different from ours as could be possible.  There are many words to illustrate, but corrupt is a prominent one.  Precedents are not meaningful, established law is scarce and procedural rules are not comparable to western systems.  That said, the man in the WH is determined to mess with China and we all can be assured that China will mess with our companies if it does not care for what the man has done.",
">>With the increased attention and crackdown at both the federal, local, and judicial level in China on foreign companies being accused of IP theft or infringement, I believe it is likely that Micron will lose this case. <<You give no support for this conclusion other than the Chinese judicial system is corrupt, the province and the country will profit from finding Micron guilty, therefore they will find this.But you glide right over the fact that employees of Micron and other Taiwan semiconductor firms (Nanya, Inotera [which is now part of Micron]) were caught red-handed stealing trade secrets from the companies and have been charged. And Micron's suits have far more credibility than UMC's suit against it. Everyone knows this. Micron has extensive IP when it comes to DRAM, China has none and UMC has little. UMC has never to my knowledge even made DRAM in the past and only in 2016 did they enter into a development partnership with Fujian Jin Hua  to develop processes for it. The harm done to China if they should so blatantly make a ruling like the one you claim is ""likely"" would be immense. If they actually execute an injunction against Micron products, the current shortages of DRAM would be exacerbated and the costs to their own companies would rise, as others have indicated. But even more importantly, companies would think twice and thrice about the extent to which they locate future businesses there. They are already not a low cost country and a corrupt judiciary would compound the costs and risks. Nearby countries like Vietnam and India would become more attractive. China thinks longer term than you indicate. Their reputation is important to the ruling bureaucracy and they do not wish to be known as a gangster banana republic, whatever some people might like to project on them.",
Yes I'm sure Micron would allow an injunction to happen over 42 million dollars.  Seems legit.,
Ok so China bans Micron dram and is left at the mercy of Samsung and Hynix. Sounds like a great place to be! Even the Commies are not that stupid.,

So you steal trade secrets and then sue the company you stole the secrets from?,
"My reply to a few points you made: ""An injunction, temporary or otherwise, would be devastating to Micron's 2018 revenue and cause the rally to reverse sharply.""""China is Micron's largest market with $10.39 billion of net sales attributable to the Chinese market in 2017 or approximately 51% of Micron's total net sales for 2017.""""An injunction would be a disaster for Micron considering in 2017, $10.39 billion of sales were from China, and while this would not affect all sales, it would affect a significant portion.""The real disaster if MU lost would bee the disastrous ripple affect that decision would have on tech worldwide - including CHINA. I don't think China is would be so short-sighted on this matter, but if they other countries beside the U.S. could retaliate in similar ways. Beside, if MU's stock was crushed there would most likely be suitors lining up to acquire MU on on any fire-sale price, thus limiting down side in the long run. Do appreciate these points tough, which have been brought up before. Take care",
"""the impact to operations that Micron will gain will be minute especially since both Jinhua and UMC have yet to release their DRAM chip""From my understanding after reading myriad MU articles, the Chinese do not have the technology to match the oligarchy (Sam, Hy, Micron, etc), so they'd be cutting off their noses to spite their faces. Don't you think any shrinking in MU chips would be immediately and completely backfilled by the Korean chips? Answer: They wouldEvery publicly traded company is involved in lawsuits and potential injunctions. AAPL vs. SAMSUNG was (and still is I think) an enormous deal. Yet they are both still thriving. You can postulate that MU may go down after their big run (& could easily be correct), but it would have absolutely nothing to do with this lawsuit.",
MU would pay the $42 M before being enjoined.,
Old news and i smell a scared short :),
I found this article to be valuable. I purchased MU at $42 and think it’s a little too hot now. I have a trailing stop in place and don’t think anyone should be so cavalier to think MU will continue to go straight up without a hiccup or two along the way. My thoughts.,
This injunction would leave China paying much more for memory than they are paying now. And even current price level is not comfortable for them as can be concluded from their recent talks to Sammy. Likelihood of this scenario is 0.1% at most.,

Which I am sure is why in the last month the average price target for the company has gone from $56 to $65. This increase is of course due to the obvious risk significantly hampering the possible reward.

So convenience of less frequent dosing is important especially when OMS721 has to be injected on a daily basis which is intolerable. More injection, more the chances of developing infection. We will see how OMS721 does in the market for aHUS. BTW your article gave me a good insight into how complement system works.",

No wonder patient requirement is very slow for OMS721 in aHUS. Also keep an eye on Cemdisiran, an RNAi drug being developed by Alnylam for aHUS. P2 data for Cemdisiran will read out by the end of this year.

Yes, we often times get manipulated down, and this does occur as someone or group of coordinated groups is shaking out retail holders -- who often have a ST view. We saw this type of activity with ARIAD, SRNE and so many others. Most recently it was TGTX that got taken down from $12 to the $8's and only recently bounced back to $16-$17. The pipeline at OMEROS is plentiful and as more positive news is disclosed, I suspect that we should all benefit nicely. Dips like we have seen off the lows are a key buying opportunity for those who can bear the risk and volatility. I'm long and the shorts will eventually have to cover.Best, EXP",

"I would suggest you dig a little deeper in your DD and not compare what I would call apples to oranges. In fact, Peachtree phase 3 results a week 24 are comparable if not better than Ozurdex at 8 weeks for the same indication (edema non associated uveitis).For CLSD we have the following results: "" Endpoints. The primary efficacy outcome of the trial was the percentage of patients who experienced an improvement of at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline at week 24. Secondary efficacy outcomes included additional measures of changes in BCVA and reductions in retinal thickness from baseline. Safety measures were monitored over the 24-week observation period and included the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, including cataracts and increases in IOP. Efficacy results.  In PEACHTREE, 45 of the 96 patients, or 47%, who received suprachoroidal CLS-TA at baseline and at 12 weeks gained at least 15 ETDRS letters in BCVA from baseline at week 24, compared to 10 of the 64 patients, or 16%, who underwent sham procedures at baseline and at week 12. This improvement, which was the primary endpoint of the trial, was statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.001. These results are summarized in the figure below.For Ozurdex we have the following results at 8 weeks: Statistically significant improvement in BCVA vs sham1-3 At week 8, 42.9% of OZURDEX® patients gained ≥ 15 letters (3 lines) from baseline BCVA vs 6.6% of sham patients (P < .001)This above comparison is for the primary outcome alone and now lets get to the keys secondary endpoints.For CLS secondary endpoint we have the follwing results :""Further, in terms of improvements in BCVA, the mean change from baseline was better in the treatment arm than the sham arm at each monthly evaluation. The mean improvement from baseline was also maintained throughout the evaluation period, with 9.6 letters gained at week 4 and 13.7 letters at week 24 in the active arm, compared to 1.2 letters at week 4 and 2.9 letters at week 24 in the control arm. The mean improvements in BCVA were statistically significant at each 4-week evaluation point, each with a p-value of less than 0.001.  The mean improvement from baseline at each 4-week evaluation point is shown in the figure below.""As for Ozurdex secondary endpoint we have the following: ""a mean change of BVCA of 10.5 versus 3 for the control arm or sham.""Now lets examine other endpoint measure such as safety for both. For CLSD we have the following:Mean change from base line in CRT-central retinal thickness was -157.4 microns for CLS-TA versus -19.2 for the sham (p = .001). As for Ozurdex it was the following : ""Significant reduction of vitreous haze vs sham1-3 46.8% of OZURDEX® patients achieved a vitreous haze score of 0 at week 8 (primary endpoint) vs 11.8% of sham patients (P < .001)1,2.Clearly CLSD CLS-TA seems to be superior especially in the loong run as the treatment effect is more durable.",Upcoming Conversation With An Expert: Digging Into The Results From Clearside's P3 PEACHTREE Trial
"Nice article Julian, I have not really dug into this one. I think I can shed some light on the ""Convenience Store Sales"" slide. Most convenience stores sell gas at little to no profit, sometimes even at a loss in states where that is legal (many states actually have laws setting a minimum that gas can be sold for). The idea being that the prominent display of the gas price is going to be a major driver of business, even if you are only a few pennies less than the store across the street. A customer might drive an extra block to go to the convenience store with gas a penny cheaper, but is unlikely to notice that the bag of chips they bought is $0.25 more expensive than the competitor. Gasoline is arguably one of the most competitively priced commodities at the retail level, so it is extremely low margin.Therefore, the slide is focusing on the ""inside sales"" metric, which are the products where the convenience store has very large margins. Fuel sales revenue will vary wildly mostly based on the wholesale costs. Whether they sell $500 billion or $300 billion in fuel, Getty's tenants probably make pretty close to the same profit, somewhere around $0.01-$0.02/gallon. Everyone else (including Uncle Sam) makes more profit than the retailer on fuel.",Getty Realty: 30% Downside To Peers

Nearly 95 percent of all deals in 2014 had a lawsuit.But a new study by myself and Matthew D. Cain, an economist with the Securities and Exchange Commission, finds that this all changed in 2015. A Delaware court crackdown on takeover litigation has driven the litigation rate to less than 22 percent.In previous years, takeover litigation was commonplace. The high rate was compounded by the fact that much of the litigation was so-called multijurisdictional litigation.

Nunc noted that RAD website says earnings release will be April 12.  I could find no mention of a con call.   All they promise is an earnings release on that date.I seriously doubt there would be a con call on a date close to an anticipated proxy.  It is somewhat pointless to tell analysts a story about RAD shares when they will disappear.There is also a risk of saying something conflicting with the proxy which is a very precise legal document.   My bet is there will be NO Conference Call and they don't have to say diddly about merger progress or how the exchange ratio and valuations were determined.,
"That a good question.  I am in uncharted waters at this point.Unlike some on this board, I don’t see bankruptcy in their short-term future, so we have time to recover.  I do feel this deal is on thin ice.  It is a very weak deal and could unravel easily.  Uncertainty brings opportunity.Like everyone, I don’t like trades going against me, so for now I am sitting tight.  I’ve bought in downward averaging, I may exit by quarters between summer and fall.  If I am going to get stuck with some Albertson’s stock it will be much less than I am holding now.  I understand Rite Aid.  Their future as a stand alone had some legs.  Their future as a bolt-on or enabler for a strategic made sense.  But there isn’t much to like from what I’ve read about Albertsons.BTY, yes you are correct, we could see 1.5’ish or 1.4’ish in the next few weeks.  However, I would expect a quick recovery to 1.8 range.  The data in mid to late April will be enlightening.  Ironically, it will probably point to why this deal should be abandon (the balance sheet of RAD is improving and ABS is getting worse).For about $0.06/share the BOD can walk away and most shareholders will applaud.  Note: shareholders holding at $2 and above will applaud.  If you are sitting below $1.8 you may want to see the conversion.  The gray area is $1.8 to $2.0.  The problem with DCA, the weighted average gets heavier and heavier.  I would have to load up at these levels to drop below $2.",
"April will be an interesting month.  Per Rite Aid's corp calendar April 12th is their 4Q & FY18 Earnings Call.  We should also see an update on the WBA store transfer and debt reduction.  Combined with probable discussion on ABS.While I remain long, this is my worst trade in 30 years. Worst by not exiting with a minor lost. Worst by deploying a proven DCA and Covered Call strategy.  That comb has work to my account benefit time an again.  Worst by not believing in the RAD curse!The frustrating thing, in SoCal the Rite Aid stores are positioned well, busy and updated.  They were deploying a Super Regional Strategy with lower debt and positive cash flow. They could have survived into 2020 looking for a new relationship.The #$%^@ CEO and his too-friendly BOD definitely jumped head first (or wallet first) into this sour deal.My experience points to major funds and institution following Management.  They rarely vote against BOD decisions.  Letters, Feds, Legal, while may feel good, usually are a waste of time.My gut, we are all holding out for the pop from an over-the-top offer.  There must be various Strat Teams reviewing this situation.  Just under $2.3B buys you newRAD.Everything else being equal, assuming even the lower end of the newRAD presentation from last fall, discounting the revenue line, using the 10-year WBA purchase agreement and cutting a little of this b.s. SG&A at corporate, you can generate a 13% return on your $2.3B for a couple of years.

"AI7 million shares sounds like a lot ,but only represents about $12 million invested.How could you possibly know if these block trades really represent a buyer who was accumulating shares?Such blocks can be the result of a large investor who wants to dump a postion and the broker takes a few hours or days to short shares in a trading account which is settled out when the block trade to buy is actually executed.

"As I have mentioned before, Rite Aid is Pigasus, as in the mythical porcine creature capable at times of flight. Since the merger has been announced, some shareholders have decided to preemptively vote no through selling off their shares. More sellers than buyers obviously causes the SP to drop.Those shareholders who sold will not be around to officially vote no when the vote comes up. We don't know how new buyers are going to vote but it is possible there is/are a buyer(s) that will vote yes, and they are picking up shares at a significant discount to the pre-announcement price. Or they know a sweeter offer is coming, or they are going to vote no and they are front running a SP recovery.  At any rate, the last couple of days are showing some significant end of day accumulation by someone(s) that may know something or they have nothing better to do than dump millions of dollars into the prize known as Pigasus.On Thursday and Friday towards the end of trading there were huge buy orders placed to buy at the ask price. Someone bought close to 7 million shares during the last minute of trading on Friday. Or perhaps these are entities scooping up shares because they sense the vote will go no and the SP will recover.

You will notice a ""range"" for each RAD value.  The first number in that range is the imputed Albertsons' stock value if one takes the Cash + 1 Share offer (10 shares of Rad covert in 1 Albertsons + $1.83 cash) and the second value in the range is the imputed Albertsons' stock value if one takes the all stock offer (1.079 shares).  You will note that the two values converge so that at the $2.50 RAD share price they are even (and this is also where the .079 of Albertsons' stock equates to approx $23.17 value for each Albertsons share.$1.50  $13.17-$13.90$1.60  $14.17-$14.83$1.70  $15.17-$15.75$1.80  $16.17-$16.68$1.90  $17.17-$17.60$2.00  $18.17-$18.53$2.10  $19.17-$19.46$2.20  $20.17-$20.30$2.30  $21.17-$21.32$2.40  $22.17-$22.24$2.50  $23.17-$23.17",
The author is not realizing the market is putting a heavy discount on Standley's leadership.  Who will want to buy a new stock being lead by someone who just openly ripped off his own shareholders at the previous company?,
This author is delusional if he thinks this proposed combined entity of Albertson's/RAD is beneficial.  That is just absurd. Has he not been paying attention to the grocers?  This RAD saga since the $9 cash offer and all of the events since is the most pathetic I've ever seen with a proposed takeover.  People like Standley need some jail time for their part in the circus.,

Make your communication succinct and it has to be based on an obvious and easy to understand reason-----such as the current value that RAD shareholders will get from this merger is not fair based on the price Walgreens was willing to pay for 1932 stores and 3 distribution centers.  It has to be to the point.  Don't let anyone write the letter for you.   Don't mention Mr. Krol or they will toss it in the waste basket.Give em hell.

The stock went up to $2.30 when the deal was announced, and then stayed at $2.00 for a while even after the deal was known.  If anyone has any insight, please share.

I think Albertson's pension promises alone mean that the company can go nowhere but bankruptcy.  Everyone knows that private company pension promises are made for expediency to retain employees long enough to extract wealth for the Vulture Fund (Cerebus) prior to dumping onto the public markets in preparation for bankruptcy.My only hope is to get out at my break even before the bankruptcy happens.  I am not even pretending like this combined company has any hope at success or reaching $25 a share.  I'll take $20 a share to exit.,
"Seems most RAD shareholders think this is a bad deal. If Cerebus and Standley think so highly of the combined company, then why not buy out RAD shareholders for $4 per share  and own 100% of the shares. This is a steal compared to what WBA paid for 43% of the stores and 3 distribution centers and they get the PBM. They could then sell the shares they need to recoup the $4 billion. I'm sure they could get Goldman and Citi to float them a bridge loan or take an equity position to cover the $4 billion in the mean time since they both were involved in putting this deal together. Or maybe this is a good deal for Cerebus and Standley  and not so much for RAD shareholders.",
"Asif SuriaSorry, I find your article lacking in providing full disclosure to Seeking Alpha readers.First of all, you fail to mention that Standley, Chairman/CEO of Rite Aid currently, and Miller, Chairman and CEO of Albertsons currently, AND same for Rite Aid previously from 1999-2007 (and director there for years longer) were instrumental in driving Rite Aid further into the ground when they were there earlier, and of course Standley until today.  This is not a guess on my part; it is based on hundreds of unannounced visits to their stores over the years when they were both there and after, and a direct meeting with Standley 11/08, whereby I had an  80 minute meeting discussing my shocking observations and left that meeting disgusted.  He just was not getting it, and went into denial mostly.Secondly, Standley has placed his shareholders in this predicament, not only because he has been incompetent as a CEO, not interested in the day to day important work of a CEO (which is 1 1/2 jobs alone) to instead place himself on outside boards, i.e. he has been AWOL too much of the time.  Add to that, court documents indicated previously that he has kept Rite Aid in a constant state of play ever since he ""officially"" became Chairman/CEO in 2012, running around trying to sell the company, rather than make it more successful lacking the talent himself or hiring those talented enough to do so.  Why sell?  Are you forgetting the $20 million in ""accelerated stock options"" he will receive for a ""change in control"".  Selling part of the company to Walgreens to get ""leaner and meaner"" does not place immediate windfalls in his bank account, AND get him a cushy job with his pal Miller.  So, what could be better for him, and not his shareholders!  Your forgetting to mention this huge perk to sell out his shareholders is quite a disservice to your readers.  Remember, the poison pill was put in by Standley for a reason.  Hint- any activists first order of business in taking a stake to make it a better company would be to remove Standley and the board for malfeasance, so they are acting in their interest of self-preservation and the simple fact that our board are ""lapdogs"" for Standley, pure and simple.  The chronology of facts leading up to the Walgreens announcement proves that!Lastly, you also fail to mention that Albertsons is in a cut throat business now.  Aldi, Lidl and other deep discounters are causing traffic decreases and margin pressures at supermarkets like Albertsons; that is what their 6/17 S4 filing admits! And Aldi expects to eventually have their prices as much as 50% below retail, based on in-house brands.  So, given Albertsons crushing debt in an industry that they are not exactly the retail supermarket of choice in their locales already, means Albertsons could end up adding their name to the list of 18 grocery chains going bankrupt since 2014.Should this merger not be approved by The FTC, or have an injunction be issued by the Delaware Courts to further evaluate whether the board met their fiduciary duties , or voted down, Standley will likely be ousted and the board replaced.  The company can not compete now  not because of Amazon, not because of reimbursement pressures although that is not helpful, no they can not compete because they are MISMANAGED.  That was why Walgreens was offering $9. per share originally.  They knew all about the mismanagement when they purchased the Rite Aid stores in Las Vegas and San Francisco in 2008 and 2009.  And I knew those stores were mismanaged, some of the worst I inspected.  Imagine better management coming in and making this company actually work properly , for the first time in 18 years.  Oh, what a nice thought!",
"I bought some shares in the $1.60s as I said I would.  I think we are at/near at least a temporary bottom.  I don't the new combined entity is worth the $9.1 B market cap being claimed by Cerberus, but I do think it is worth $6-7 B.  That would put the valuation at $1.70 to $2.00.

Interesting. What do you think odds of Albert increasing cash or stock% to Rad holders?,
"The way I see it is like this:1. You can hope for a white knight to save you with an all cash offer over $2 a share for RAD.  This is unlikely.2. You can sell now before it falls even lower, although the time to exit was much higher than current share price.3. You can hold for 1 year or more and hope that the first earnings report from the combined company pushes the combined company's share price back up to your break even so you can start to exit.I am going with option 3 and will be holding for years if necessary.  If the combined company starts to look like a bankruptcy case I will exist at any price.  The pension obligations Albertson's has will definitely result in a failed company at some point, so my hope is to exit at a break even.",

Good job! Thanks for presenting a thoughtful analysis of what we know about the two companies.,
This deal screwed the shareholders of Rite Aid. The only winners are Standley and Cererbus.  Cererbus has found a vehicle to unwind their investment in Albertson’s. Albertson’s is on the verge of bankruptcy this helps them get their capital out before that happens. It will happen within 24 to 36 months is this dog has so many fleas it will fail.For the record I was a big bag holder owning shares from $7.00 down to $2.00. I was fortunate enough to on wine some of it last December to offset some gains elsewhere. But I was stupid enough to buy some lower prices thinking this could still get done with a white by a white knight in the $5.00 range.How wrong was I since I evidently did not understand that this dog had serious disease and it would not make it.I sold out yesterday for $1.72 it will be happy to put those funds into something with enough positive upside to offset my stupidity in hanging on to Rite Aid this long.Lessons learned.,

If you include the $614 million of outstanding redeemable, convertible preferred stock in the EV, then the EV is $3.447 billion and the FCF yield is 19.3%.

Hard to argue with this.  Here's my 2 cents.seekingalpha.com/...,
"I like buybacks.  The fewer shares a company has outstanding, the more valuable each share  automatically becomes.  That is simple math. --  What I would sell are stocks with high beta.",
Whist I agree with the thrust of the article actuallly SP500 market cap was about $24 trillion at the end of 2017. So buybacks are about 4% of total market cap.,

"I have had some time to research this article and I think it's overblown.First the total shares outstanding has not went down by that much in Figure 1. Going down from 313 Billion to 290 Billion shares over about 6 years is only a 7% move down or around 1% per year roughly. That's not material. I had the opportunity to read a good article on buybacks which I summarized in a blog post at the link below. It comes from a different angle, but it provides solid logic on why much of the current stock buyback rhetoric is wrong. One of the most important points to keep in mind is even though buybacks are high there is also a lot of stock being sold through issuance. Another point is that buybacks are just another way to return cash to shareholders. Dividends are double taxed, and the recipient cannot control the tax event. Capital gains are not double taxed and the shareholder can recognize the taxation when they want. See blog post by clicking on:https://seekingalpha.c...",

@KirkHow many of these buybacks are a sign of companies being undervalued? Or a strategy to keep their stock high so they can buy someone else out? If a 3rd party wanted to buy them what would they want for a price? I rarely see a company sell without getting a premium. Debt is cheap right now so LBO's would make sense in some sectors. Nordstroms is looking to do an LBO. Buybacks are a way to keep the stock price up.The number of available public companies is less than 4000 right now and that's down from 7500 in 1998.

"Instead of a company announcing a buyback program, some of them could just do tender offers instead.  They can just do straight tender offers at a price above the current market price, if they really think their stock is undervalued.  (Example:  The aforementioned Kroger (KR), which could offer a substantial premium and still be way less than the 52 week high.  A tender offer is stronger than a buyback because it is not so open ended- it is a company's way of saying ""We will buy back, say, 10% of our outstanding stock at a price, say, 10% above the current market price one month from today.""  This is really putting your money where your mouth is.  The tender should always be for over 5% of the company stock, so it can't be considered a mini-tender.  The SEC has spoken in the past about many problems with mini-tenders- I won't get into that here.Now keep in mind that there could be a Dutch Auction clause added to the tender.  For instance,  KR closed today at $23.69.  Let's say they did a Dutch Auction tender offer to buy shares at $26 to $27 a share with sellers offering to sell in 10 cent increments.  The lowest priced 10% of shares needed would  be accepted.  So, if they could get 10% of the shares by paying $26.40, that is the price that would be paid for all shares taken, whether the seller offered to sell them at the $26 minimum or at $26.40 or anywhere in between.Let's say you have 1,000 shares of KR.  If you tendered at the minimum price of $26, you would be guaranteed to have them take at least 10% (and likely quite a bit more as many won't tender their shares) at some price between $26 and $27 a share.  You could end up selling, say 20% of your shares at the final $26.40 price.  If the company added an odd lot clause so that those with 99 shares or less per tax ID who validly tender their shares will be guaranteed to have them all taken, all the better.  Odd lot clauses are pretty popular in these tender offers.An example of a recent tender offer for a well known company that had the odd lot clause was just before Thanksgiving when CBS (CBS) sold their radio station business to Entercom (ETM).  CBS put in a potential 8% incentive to participate in the deal.  Most everyone who did this deal ended up making even more than the stated 8%- most of my friends who participated ended up netting in the 13-15% range.Another example of a recent tender offer that ended on March 5th was for Amgen (AMGN).  They did a Dutch Auction offering to buy at a price between $175 and $200 a share and ended up paying $192.  They bought 7.2% of the company stock.  I missed out on this one because the stock didn't get quite cheap enough for my buy order to be triggered.  Oh well- can't win them all.Tender offers are a good way for a company whose stock has been beaten down to earn some goodwill and also issue a strong statement that they firmly believe in the future.  I think that if the recent Kroger buyback announced was done as a tender offer with odd lot protection, that could have worked really well.Sorry to be so wordy with this posting, but tender offers is an important concept that too few people know about or look for.",
"I agree with many posters. This article is incomplete. WACC needs to be taken into factor as well as the Company's other projects it can invest in. There is a happy medium and nowhere in the article did I see this analysis. Do you really think Boeing is just buying back shares and not investing in modernization and watching its debt levels? I don't. The author is looking from the outside in. Could he be right? Time will tell but just because a company buys back shares does not make it bad. There are plenty of examples of where this has turned out well. What the author fails to explain is a Company with $0 debt is less tax efficient than a Company with debt. So, debt needs to be on the balance sheet to maximize shareholder value. Now, I am not saying go invest in a Company levered to the breaking point. What I am saying is that using very cheap 10-30 year debt at record low interest rates to buy back shares is a good idea. Many of these Companies do not need to either A) Invest in capital projects as they already operate and own enough factories to meet the Company's market needs, B) Pay down debt that is on the balance sheet C) Modernize operations.There are many ways to finance a Company's operations. Debt is one and Equity is the other. Does it make more sense to finance higher shareholder returns through buybacks or expanding? The answer to this question is difficult. It is very likely that a Company will need to go outside its expertise to increase shareholder value if it is in a saturated market. Take Amazon for example. They are the Wal-Mart online. How far can they get being Wal-Mart? Bezos knew this and a number of years back started using capital to invest in other industries to try and build shareholder value. I am not a fan of Amazon's stock but one could hardly argue with the results. Sealed Air Corp back in the 80's borrowed/levered itself to impossible debt levels and paid it all to shareholders through a one time dividend. Well, the ending to that story is I wouldn't be posting on here had I owned that ones stock. I appreciated the poster who added the Freeport story as that is a great example of a Company going into an industry without expertise and failing. My preference would be for the Company to go in a little at a time, get the expertise needed and then make the decision on whether to go all in. It doesn't always work.The moral to the story is buybacks are usually shareholder friendly in my opinion as many Companies reserve a certain amount each year for buybacks. Can they be abused, yes. Are they typically abused as the author states? Did he convince you by stating just look back at the 90's and 2000's? I personally like to see a little more research than hey, take my word for it and go do your own research but hey, each person makes their own decisions. Interesting article though and great discussion.",

"I'm not a big fan of the way buybacks play out -- so you're preaching to the choir on that one.

Let's round our math and call that a cool 12%,"" that's not correct. Looks like you took the dollar value of funds indexed to the S&P 500.

No one ever mentions that. For any co of less than say, $4 bill or $5 bill mkt cap, this ongoing diltuiion is really a very serious challenge to the organization.",

"""Buybacks will fall dramatically once the economy starts to slow and the impact of repatriated money dissipates - as soon as Q1 2019.""Seems optimistic to me.

"Kirk, great article.  Thanks for providing all of those informative charts, particularly on the buybacks.The weakness of the USD is becoming an increasingly important factor in determining what will happen in the next 12 months.The weak USD has been adding fuel to the fire in pushing down or keeping down the 10 year yield via foreign demand (in addition to our attractive nominal yields)The weak USD has also been adding fuel to the foreign demand for US stocks, and as you articulated above, if the USD were to strengthen, foreign demand for US stocks would diminish. In addition , long term yields could potentially rise without the extensive foreign demand that's now containing them.""Here's a question to ask company by company: how many of those BODs would have been better served paying down corporate debt in an era that threatens to have tighter liquidity? I would venture most.""Great steatement.  So given that corporations are taking the easy way out, and not using this tax break and repatriation to pay down debt (cheap debt for now), we can assume one thing is certain: US corporations will continue to be debt heavy for the foreseeable future.This is a very precarious position that they are getting themselves into, given that the dollar is so weak.  Any surge in the USD will put upward pressure on long term yields (adding to fiscal spending and balance sheet unwind).   Debt heavy with rising long term refinancing spells trouble,Quick question: the banking/financial sector in general seems to be still highly capitalized as you mentioned, with a lot of shares outstanding, despite vigorous repurchasing.  Notwithstanding WFC, does this portend well for the general banking industry, especially if long term interest rates were to continue rising (increasing their loan margin profitability)?",

"""Bubble"" is quickly becoming the most overused word of 2018. Not everything that happens a lot is a bubble.For sure, buybacks are artificially propping up stock prices, but there is no bubble, because those purchased shares won't ever just randomly disappear. Companies own them. They are real. At some point, those shares will be re-issued or re-sold and those stock prices will fall again, but falls after large sales are a normal part of the stock market. Nothing to see here at all.",
"This is a really interesting concept Kirk.What I find fascinating is that corporate buybacks only account for approx 1% of total shares outstanding each year for the past 7-8 years. That's not nothing, but it's a lot less than I would have guessed looking at my own portfolio, and it's clearly NOT been the primary driver behind shareholder returns at any point during this bull market.",
"Paying down debt when interest rates are at generational lows doesn't make sense.  If you're paying 3% after tax via interest, buying back debt is equivalent to earning a 3% return.  I don't know if buybacks make sense for all companies, but I doubt many are buying back shares at lower than a 3% yield (equivalent to a 33.3 PE)...  Now, if you're over-leveraged and need to reduce debt, that's one thing, but the vast majority of S&P 500 companies are over-capitalized.You also fail to mention the only thing that you need to think about in terms of buybacks.  Is the Company buying back stock at less than intrinsic value?  If it is, value is being destroyed.  If bought below intrinsic value, value is immediately created for remaining shareholders.If I'm invested in a company, by definition it means I believe the Company is undervalued.  That's why provided the Company can't earn higher returns by investing in the business, I strongly encourage buybacks.  I'd much rather Companies buy back stock for less than intrinsic value than force me to pay tax on dividends...",

"Excellent article.   When stuff starts to hit the fan, the whole market will feel it.",
"Author does not offer a lot of support for his thesis that buybacks will dry up.  His economic reasoning is thin.  There are a lot of highly educated CFO's who closely monitor debt levels, debt costs and weighted cost of capital.  Their job is not to just make a company safe and give raises to employees--it is to make money for shareholders.  The huge buybacks in large tech companies in recent years by Apple, Cisco, Oracle, Microsoft, Alphabet appear to have been fantastic buys that made money or shareholders.  Sure companies can make mistakes in this regard but why should we buy this author's thesis when the strong buyback trend has led to decreasing stock supply, higher equity prices and shows no signs of reversing?  Why should we trust that he can call a big reversal here?  I see nothing in his reasoning that will make me shift focus.I tend to discount screeds that rail against buybacks.  Stupid politicians think the buybacks do nothing for the economy because they want every dollar generated to feather a bed for one of their rent-seeking constituencies.  Buybacks actually efficiently reallocate capital.  It makes no sense to reinvest all of your profits into the same activity if you see diminishing returns.  Let the equity holders decide where to deploy the capital returned to them.",
Great set of data.  Where are ETF & Mutual Fund purchases accounted for in the charts above?  They are not made explicit (in the fine print) in either household or institution activity.,
"All these buybacks is yet another reason why all these companies should not be bailed out again come the next crisis.  They never should have been bailed out the first time - rather the equity holders should have been wiped out, bond holders received a large haircut at the very least.Now we have executives acting like their stock is a screaming buy at any price.",

"Since so much stock repurchasing was funded by bond issuance, why not use newly available corporate cash and income tax savings to repurchase those same bonds?  This way corporations won't have to worry about refinancing those bonds in a future, likely higher interest rate environment.  Can likely buy the bonds back at a discount, since they were issued when rates were lower.",
Fair bit of possibly useful information was compiled. Thank you.,
"Buyback is a financial engineering, and not any real growth. AS you said it will be badfor investors and good for insiders who know when to sell.",
"Appreciate the data and perspective but don't necessarily agree with the conclusions. Share buybacks are one of many potential capital allocation decision, neither necessarily good or bad.  The decision may be accretive to long term value or destructive (or neutral). There may better alternatives for the cash, there may not and the decision really can't be properly evaluated w/o the benefit of time & hindsight.  If buybacks are necessarily bad, then wouldn't stock issuance be good? The resulting strategy would suggest you go out and buy companies issuing stock. Not.  The supply/demand argument for stocks is just too simplistic in my view and short term in nature.  Corporate managements make capital investment decisions based on future and competitive risk/return decisions, not supply and demand decisions for their stock. which is implicitly short term in nature.",
I agree with your article whole heatedly. What are your thoughts on Ford and SWN?,
Buy backs were once considered insider trading and not allowed until reagan was elected.  Combined with stock compensation this led to executives loving buy backs to increase their personal compensation,
"Thanks for the very insightful article.I would much prefer companies to pay down debt, invest for future growth and if applicable to that company, increase dividends.  The U.S. market returns have been phenomenal the past 10 years but can't be sustained indefinitely.  Those that say holding some cash/dry powder is foolish, won't be saying that when the market drops 40%.  These ridiculous valuations and returns are built on smoke and mirrors more than fundamentals.  Time will tell but I have to agree, an economic slow-down and strong market decline are likely closer than most believe.  Recent volatility points towards a drop in demand for equities as well and this should only increase in the coming quarters.Markets outside the U.S. offer better valuations and future returns going forward, although a drop in U.S. markets would also affect them as well, at least in the short to intermediate term.",

"In principle, a buyback is an admission of defeat on the part of the CEO and BOD.  Those worthies should always be looking to put extra cash to work by expanding the business through internal ROC improvement investments, or by acquiring other businesses with potentially better ROC than is being achieved internally.  A buyback is like a DoDo bird, which runs around in ever-decreasing circles until it finally disappears up it own posterior orifice.That being said, there have been two reasonable ""excuses"" for buybacks over the past few years.  One, of course, is the overseas stranded cash excuse -- which has now been eliminated by the recent tax law changes.  The other is the  excuse that Obama-era anti-business regulations, coupled with an insipid economy, presented little opportunity to usefully put additional capital to work, while ZIRP offered dirt-cheap bond financing if such opportunities should arise.Stockholder opprobrium is probably the answer.  If stockholders bitch and moan about buybacks, rather than encouraging them, the buybacks will largely stop.   All that is required is to make buybacks uncool.",
Excellent article on the downside of buybacks.,
"The interesting thing about bubbles, is that they can take a long time to pop. As long as government spending is high, the big bust can be pushed out. With the tax cuts and other tricks that Trump will enact, it could make this party last quite a while. If the Fed doesn't do anything stupid, which is doubtful, this whole thing can go until near the end of his possible second term.",
"Kirk, when a company buys back stock it is because it does not need the capital. But the effect is that the shareholder gets his money back. What happens next is the issue. Does the former shareholder"" a) spend the money at the mall (puts the excess capital back into the consumption stream), b) looks for a company that DOES need the capital and invests it there, thus adding to national invested capital of c) burns it up in the back yard bar B que! Both a and b would be good for the economy and there are only 2 choices as c) was obviously for comic relief!",

Top article:->,
Data on market vs buyback that I have heard about and finally get to read in detail all in your article.,
Great topic.  I agree.  Will have to come back and re-read this later.,
"Interesting topic for an article.  Here is some info on a stock that I didn't see mentioned- McDonalds (MCD)...From their 2012 Annual Report- Total revenues were $27.567 billion for 34,480 restaurants.  This includes both company owned and franchise locations worldwide.  From their 2016 Annual Report- Total revenues were just $24.622 billion a full four years later with 7.0% more restaurants (36,899 locations).Lower revenues over a four year period with 7% more restaurants doesn't sound too good.  Yet the stock price from 12/31/12 to 12/30/16 went up 57.2% including dividends.  How did the stock do so well?  Buybacks.  In 4Q16 alone they bought 11.8 million shares.  Also, there was a $15 billion buyback authorized in late 2015.  When we get the annual report for 2017 it may be even more extreme as MCD stock went from $117.92 at the end of 2016 to $171.04 at the end of 2017 (so up 45.0% including divs.).  Also keep in mind that a number of locations likely had increased wages due to minimum wage numbers going up in many U.S. areas.  Not sure about what might have happened in foreign locales.  At some point this will set up to be an interesting potential short sale candidate.",
"Kirk,Thank you for making available lots of helpful info. Corporations are buying their shares while institutions are net sellers. From my observation, corporations don't have a great track record of timing their share repurchases. It's eye-opening that 42% of the buybacks have been in the financial sector.I agree with you that, in general, debt reduction is a better use of cash than share buybacks. Unfortunately, it doesn't have as much curb appeal as ""returning cash to shareholders.""Your closing thought is very sobering and causes me to ask, ""To what degree is the market priced for perfection?"":""The world is about to become very volatile. We are at the intersection of inflation, deflation and stagflation. Missteps can cause the global economy to tumble into recession and for markets to revert to historical valuations which would mean a 30-50% decline. Find out where the safe spots are and how to benefit from global change under any circumstances.""All the best,Ted",

You will note that the two values converge so that at the $2.50 RAD share price they are even (and this is also where the .079 of Albertsons' stock equates to approx $23.17 value for each Albertsons share.$1.50  $13.17-$13.90$1.60  $14.17-$14.83$1.70  $15.17-$15.75$1.80  $16.17-$16.68$1.90  $17.17-$17.60$2.00  $18.17-$18.53$2.10  $19.17-$19.46$2.20  $20.17-$20.30$2.30  $21.17-$21.32$2.40  $22.17-$22.24$2.50  $23.17-$23.17",
"This whole mess (RAD) is a complete embarrassment and should result in Standley going to jail.  Where has he met the fiduciary duties to s'holders?  He is a pathetic crook, crony capitalism at its worse.",
"muishinYou are right that it is basically looting shareholder equity.   Usually it would be restricted by various debt covenants, but this apparently is not the case with Albertsons.My guess is that this is being done because Cererbus took on investor partners who are all in the real estate business such as Kimco and Shottenstein who are all predator types that look at cash flow and nothing else.   It is remarkable that Kimco invested $140M ten years ago and has been paid back some $30 M per year on average which is a 20% cash return.  They likely did so when the real estate markets offered perhaps a 15% cap rate on most deals and this was a bit risker and less liquid as we now know based on failed IPO attempts.It says a great deal about how Cererbus operates.  My guess is that all they are doing with RAD is accessing market liquidity and will sell off the parts of RAD slowly to the highest bidder unless there is some reason to integrate them with Albertsons pharmacies.  The PBM will be dumped.   The idea of maintaining two HQ's---one in UT and one in PA is just a ruse.",
"Some folks here think that Albertsons is in trouble and going out of business.  This is simply not true.  They are no where near bankruptcy and were able to pay out some $250 M in ""distributions"" to what they call member owners.   They have no debt covenants which restricts such a payment. There is no liquidity crises or anything near that.The deal to merge with RAD is all about fantasy valuation numbers to determine the share of ownership that RAD shareholders should get in the merged company.   Currently, if all RAD shareholders take stock, they will get 28% ownership of the combined firm.This number probably should be closer to 40%.   Standley apparently just agreed to it because they offered him the CEO job which will pay handsomely.   They probably don't need Standley at all and the idea of keeping two headquarters, one in Utah and one in PA is really suspicious if the firm really claims there are synergies.  My guess is that the mergeco is just to access publicly traded listed shares via a reverse IPO transaction and they might well sell off most of the operations now run by RAD and the PBM would be on top of the list of assets to dump.",
"There are both Albertsons and Safeway stores in my neighborhood. A few years ago Safeway was worth shopping. Since then prices have risen (compared to other groceries) and quality has fallen enormously. Quality used to be Safeway's advantage over the others, but now they are inferior to the others. As a humble example, they were famous for tasty sourdough bread (as good as in San Francisco), and it was terrific, but no longer. I used to go out of my way to go to Safeway, now I go out of my way to avoid them.  It seems obvious that Safeway's blood was sucked out by the current vampire owners, and so obvious that it must be affecting RAD's price.Another factor in RAD's low price is investor exhaustion. Everyone with ANY stop loss self-discipline is out of RAD. Everyone still holding RAD without a stop loss hates it. RAD is like poison ivy now. If you had it you want to forget it. If you still have it, itch...itch...itch...and you don't want more.",

"Stock price is signifying that it has lost all faith in Standley.  It is almost like it is collectively asking itself what he will do next.   All he had to do was pay down the debt, save $200 million in interest payments, make no other changes and have a $4 price per share based on 20 p/e. Easy.  Instead he enters into his second buyout agreement where no one knows what the value is (recall that the $6.50 to $7.00 gave a range, but not a specific value like every other buyout in the history of the world).  This buy out is infinitely worse than his plan to reduce the WBA deal from $9 to the range of $6.50 to $7.  The price today in my opinion does not suggest that the deal will go through.  On the contrary, if the market thinks that the deal is bad, it is more likely that shareholders will vote to reject the deal.  That will be the first domino and the second will be the removal of Standley.  That will propel the stock by at least 2x maybe even 3x or 4x.",

The deal definitely sucks for RAD shareholders.  I am not sure how Standley can look at himself in the mirror when he is hurting so many shareholders all while he rakes in millions in his new CEO job at Albertsons.  The problem is that Albertsons is a private company and it is impossible to value what it will trade for on the stock market.  Yes it has thousands of stores and billions in sales per year but they have so much debt that they are unable to compete and be profitable.  Their book value was $3.06 in 2016 so is likely only about $2 per share after so many huge operating losses.  After combining with RAD the book value will be about $3.  Their debt expense per year will be $1Billion annually.  Combined they will be about the same size as Krogers.  Krogers makes $2 EPS a year and their stock is priced at $23.  When Albertsons can't make a profit how can you expect the shares to trade at the same levels as Krogers?  I think realistically Albertsons will trade at $8-10.     The only reason this deal is going forward is that the Private Capital company who owns Albertsons needs access to becoming a public company in order to monetize their investment.  Albertsons is in such bad financial shape that a reverse merger is their only hope.   I sold all my RAD on the day of the merger announcement.  I was very hopeful with the deal until I took the time to read up on Albertsons financial condition and the deal RAD shareholders were getting.  I sold because I did not like the terms.  I am still watching RAD because I think their might be a chance the deal falls through and I would like to get back in if that happens.,

It is clear that either the market is wrong or Citibank is waaaaaaaaaaaaay wrong.   I would not like to be the person whose name is on that fairness opinion.  All of the above is MY OPINION.",

"Vlad,I really appreciate the analysis as I've considered several times an exercise like this with SDLP, RIG, ESV, etc. to help come up with some sort of baseline valuation for them. One thought though- I wonder if backlog should only be valued at a smaller percentage of cash and debt. I'm basically arguing that backlog isn't worth that much inherently because it just represents revenue to be brought in, but there are operating costs to bring in that revenue. So the amount that will make it back to shareholders is multiplied by say the operating margin (33% according to SA).Perhaps I'm being too nitpicky and this exercise was just intended to show that SDLP's intrinsic worth is in the same ball park as their equity. I certainly appreciate the analysis as I said, and it's good to know that SDLP at worst isn't worth considerably under their market cap. Even though I still see them as worth less currently after applying an operating margin to the backlog, your analysis has shown that they are close enough to being worth more if they can get new contracts after the existing ones.",

"Since Odyssey doesn’t seem capable of posting the actual statistics that airlines publish regarding frequent flyer program redemption, I’ll post it here.  All of this information comes directly from each airline’s 2017 10K reports which are available on the investor relations sections of their websites. AALDuring 2017 , our members redeemed approximately 11 million awards including travel redemptions for flights and upgrades on American and other air carriers, as well as redemption of car and hotel awards, club memberships and merchandise. Approximately 6.1% of our 2017 total revenue passenger miles flown were from award travel.DALSkyMiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for air travel on Delta and participating airlines, for membership in our Delta Sky Clubs ® and for other program participant awards. Mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards on partner airlines are subject to capacity-controlled seating. We offer last-seat availability for travel awards on our own flights (including most Delta Connection flights). In 2017 , program members redeemed more than 345 billion miles in the SkyMiles program for 14.9 million award redemptions. During this period, 7.9% of revenue miles flown on Delta were from award travel.UALApproximately 5.4 million and 5.2 million MileagePlus flight awards were used on United in 2017 and 2016, respectively. These awards represented 7.5% and 7.7% of United’s total revenue passenger miles in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total miles redeemed for flights on United in 2017, including class-of-service upgrades, represented approximately 85% of the total miles redeemed. In addition, excluding miles redeemed for flights on United, MileagePlus members redeemed miles for approximately 2.3 million other awards in 2017 as compared to 2.0 million in 2016. These awards include United Club memberships, car and hotel awards, merchandise and flights on other air carriers.For those who can read and digest what is posted, Delta’s Skymiles program offered more reward miles and a higher percentage of their capacity for award seats than either American and United.Southwest hasn’t posted its 2017 10K but for 2016, 12.7% of their revenue passenger miles were for mileage awards, amounting to 8.3 million awards.In fact, Delta awarded more Skymiles awards than any other airline in the US – and probably in the world and offered a higher percentage of its capacity for mileage capacity – PRECISELY BECAUSE EVERY SEAT CAN BE REDEEMED FOR MILEAGE.It is very clear that Odyssey chose to drag a topic onto not one but two SA articles using anecdotal statements about which he is absolutely incorrect with his statements.

If leading PC and server vendors can help broadcast customer wins and new designs using AMD technology, that would be real progress.Meantime, I worry that INTC has changed the rules of the game, i.e. by integrating memory, interconnects, FPGA, photonics into its server chip designs, making the previous better processor speeds a tough one to measure and declare victories on.",

Secondly based on 1st Qtr guidance of $1550m the figure of $0.39 is plain wrong. $0.39 eps is based on the assumption that for the rest of Qtrs AMD will maintain the same revenue as 1st Qtr.Taking same seasonality as 2017 the revenues will more likely be  the following 1.55b, 1.922b, 2.575b, $2.34b which gives eps as 0.10 + 0.12 + 0.16 + 0.15 = 0.53.This EPS of 0.53 is really conservative and should replace 0.39.

Both Nvidia and Intel both know modular is the future now amd ahas shown the way, but didn't see the immediate danger lurking in wimpy Amd.Intel have been caught flatfooted, and Nvidia's dusted off plan relies on a non x86  discrete cpu card, which may sound good, but never gained traction in many similar past attempts at using aptly named RISC cpuS.AMD have killer IP assets and skillsets in BOTH the vital areas needed for future markets, gpu & cpu. The competition must rely on fraught marriages of convenience with an arch competitor to deliver complete modern solutions to modern problems.Even if AMD simply matches the others, they win customers wanting the benefit of a one supplier solution.The recent ""humble"" (for now) apu, is the crowning synthesis of the above.

"In looking for a good steel stock to buy, I bought CMC. So far so good. Now that all the steel stocks have gone up I started looking for another beneficiary of what looks to me to be a U.S. steel industry revival, and came across SXCP. They make met coal for steel making blast furnaces. If interested go to their website and read their 1 March presentation. This MLP's cash distribution is 12.5%. Normally a warning sign but they are forecasting 1.04-1.08 coverage for '18. Also a year or so ago their LP made a cash offer for SXCP which shareholders voted down. Since then the LP has bought 4 million shares of SXCP in the open market and now own 61%. Looks to me like maybe a higher offer will come. In the meantime they operate at capacity and pay me 12.5%. Note in their 1 March presentation: Their met coal del. price is $250 vs. $490 from China! I own SXCP at $19.25, and am buying more. The LP bought all their 4 million shares between $17-18, so that looks like a bottom to me.",

He could have raised more capital when the share price was higher and kept this as an insurance and if it turned out not to be needed for OMS721 he could have used it to speed up development of the pre-clinical pipeline?

Here's my response:How do you suppose Roche SKY59 causes hypersensitivity reaction? All complement medicine competitors of ALXN slowly faded away. I reviewed all of them and only Omeros' OMS721 can compete and probably outdone ALXN's C5's inhibitors. OMS721 targets the initiation and amplification phase of complement cascade. Its benefits are two folds: it works at the endothelial cellular level thus sufficiently prevent this cascade from ""overreacting"" from the root cause; it leaves other pathways intact thus allows the body to fight the real infectious agent if need arises (no adverse side effect in term of life threatening infection).I suspect that Roche SKY59 causes hypersensitivity reaction is due to their ""humanized monoclonal antibody"" design. It's not fully human as they typically use mouse or rat antibodies and combine with human antibodies. Remember this is our body defense network so it's very alert and sensitive to foreign protein.Omeros' OMS721 is fully human monoclonal antibodies so I don't think it will pose any problem in this area.",

There was another step down from the low $14s to the $13s on Feb. 13 and 14.

@e... Mute,
bk mid 2019,
Well said! I would say this analysis is spot on.,
"You’re kidding me. You’re going to sit on the sidelines ?? THIS is the time to be putting skin in the game while uncertainty is high and prices low. -One thing I think most analysts are overlooking is the growing percentage of volume being pushed through the Vivint Smart home dealer, which I think the CEO said is around 12–13% in Q4. Now with dynamic pricing back on the table MWs booked are going to see an uptick and I wouldn’t be surprised if Vivint Smart home is responsible for 20+ % of overall volume by the beginning of 2019. Perhaps that’s how mgmt. believes the company is going to do substantially more volume (YOY 2017/2018) even with a substandard Q1.  They are “not shy about” expecting blowout #s in the last three quarters, per earnings. It’s really a shame that more people aren’t tuned in and excited about $VSLR, I think people are leaving a lot of money on the table, as I think this company is massively undervalued long-term.  Most people are still dealing the company through the lens of the $SUNE debacle – which wasn’t even there fault, by the way!  At any rate, it’s left a tarnish on the company where people mistakenly presume they are in danger of BK, which is weird, because ever since the new CEO (ex-Vivint Smart Home COO) has come over, all management has done quarter after quarter is execute and increase the efficiency of the business. I mean, prior to section 201 limbo (and the concurrent  tax equity/ BEAT/ AMT scare) $VSLR was trading at $4.20.In my opinion, this is FREE MONEY. (1) The company has strong fundamentals, (2) capable, competitive management that is showing its willingness to adapt to a changing market. Sure, there are  facing some headwinds coming into 2018, but it’s nothing that will endanger the company or shrink market share. (3) Another thing that people forget is that this is a company that is owned by Blackstone ($BX), one of the best, smartest, and most efficient private equity firms on the planet, so, let any fears BK or underperforming be laid to rest.  My advice: Use this stock like a high yield savings or money market account. Get in at this price and walk away for a year. You’ll thank me in 2019 when you come back to $7-8 a share.",Vivint Solar: Are Sunny Days Ahead?

Let's move to MTBs new article...https://seekingalpha.c...,
"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion regarding the subject of acquisitions by Geron. Here's mine:First of all it is HIGHLY unlikely that Scarlett would do anything until he is certain milestone payments are in the works. Second, it is pretty certain that, after all this time, they have a good idea about an acquisition that would be accretive, that is, growth by gradual addition. This is not a bet-the-farm process but a slow methodical addition that would allow Geron to gain status as a growth company.The reason he brings it up at every conference is to show that Geron will not be a coupon clipper and rest on the status of Imetelstat forever. This is a good thing as it may keep other companies at bay and allow for the success of Imetelstat to build into a more rounded company. I see the potential for an eventual merger of equals, without having to sell cheaply. We need Geron to become a large multi-dimensional company. The base will be the milestones and royalties, but many great up-and-coming companies may want to join forces with what may end up being a ""cash cow"" company. I want this company to grow and to keep on growing. Success breeds success!",
"How do we get chippy to STOP talking about new acquisitions?The ONLY reason that GERN would need any new acquisitions is to provide chippy and crew plausible ""evidence"" to support their egregious compensation. What do they currently do to JUSTIFY their monies?  Answer?  Little to Nothing since the Janssen License was inked!  And, that was in 2014!!!How many years, REALISTICALLY, does chippy have left before retiring?  10? 5? Less???The very last thing that GERN investors need is a money sump or two or three that needs years and years and years before becoming profitable!Of course, IMO.",
"I have to say, Kudos to Anna K. for being quite responsive to several of us after the presentation. She actually helped to clarify some things. Maybe this foretells a “new Geron.""",
I would like people's thoughts sentence of the talk where the speaker says that Geron is still looking for other oncology acquisitions. It doesn't sound they are expecting to be bought out.,
"It’s entirely possible that GERN is a stronger and better buy today at 4.19 then when it was at 2.00.There is a lot more clarity today, we are much closer to where we wish to be and approval appears more certain. Median overall survival is longer and a positive continuation decision is more likely. It now appears extremely unlikely that JNJ will walk away from Imet. Imet in my view is transformational, unique, novel and extremely interesting. It’s prolonging the lives of very sick R/R MF patients, people who were formerly without options. This is truly remarkable.I keep looking at this very expensive market in order to discover something I like better than GERN and I cannot find it.I therefore purchased additional shares today. This purchase did not increase my overall cost basis by much since I bought most of my shares at a much lower price.-	Sargasso",

What is an enduring mystery is the possibility of CR/PR in IMBARK. This info is being closely guarded and couched in other language. I have a feeling they want to create maximum impact by releasing this info at a conference.,
That is some cool out of the box thinking. I like it!,
OS will always be from when treatment is initiated,
"One thing to keep in mind as we try to parse out what Dr. S actually meant with his comments which were as noted in discussion here-opaque.  OS is how long patients live from the time of enrollment or treatment initiation (or possibly from the time JAK inhibitor stopped, we don't know for sure when they started the clock), this measure includes death from any reason even if unrelated to the disease.  Typically I have seen 5 or ten years as a target to represent a surrogate for cure.  Ok so in contrast median OS is only reached when 50% of patients die and 50% are still alive.  This is different from OS which means waiting for every patient live for a defined period, for example 5 years as in ""the five year survival rate is x"".  I suppose the median survival rate in the R/R group for MF could be 5 years if 50% of patients lived that long (unlikely-but some small numbers might).  We are in uncharted territory with life extensions never seen before.  I highly doubt that life extension of five years is reasonable but it did seem to happen for John! who was weeks from death.   There may be subgroups that are important and once the combination therapies are evaluated one's imagination may be the limiting factor.  bp",

Interesting to note the last sentence of the presentation where they mention rather casually that Geron is still looking for oncology acquisitions.

Comments from the group?,
"Sage- Here is your answer from Anna:Krassowska, Anna5:58 PM (12 hours ago)Jay – the purpose of the protocol amendment for IMbark is to enable patients who are benefitting from imetelstat to continue receiving the drug at the discretion of the investigator.  Recall that we have previously stated that the trial completion date was April 2018 – this amendment is to extend beyond that.  And of course survival data will be collected where possible, because that is of interest.  However, importantly, note that the primary analysis of the trial, which includes an assessment of overall survival (and is what ultimately drives the end of Q3 timing for the Continuation Decision), will begin by the end of Q2 2018.  That timing is not affected by the protocol amendment, no matter how long some patients might continue to remain on imetelstat.  Does that help?Anna From: Jay Sent: Monday, March 19, 2018 4:25 PMTo: Krassowska, Anna Subject: Re: Can you explain what this is supposed to mean or say Sage_FanComments (202) |+ Follow |Send Message |AnnaSorry to ask so much, but some of Dr. S’s enthusiasm and time constraints maybe got some things mixed up. The following I found confusing.“So in order to continue to follow patients, we just needed to amend the protocol get approved through ethics committees and so forth. So that’s really I would say the principal driver.And obviously the reason we wanted to do that is because we still have not seen median survival reached in either of the arms or either the original arms in the study. So we’d like to continue at least through that point of time. So that really dictates the protocol amendment predominantly one of timing.”I am still confused by the above passages. “We’d like to continue at least through that point of time” to get to the median OS?Thank you Jay",
We are at 996 comments... Perhaps we should move to the SA transcript of yesterday’s conference call until the next Geron article comes out?,
Anna emailed back at like midnight last night.  they won't tell the # of deaths they expect to have by the end of 2Q so there is no telling what type of analysis they will be performing.  She says it is for competitive reasons which is ridiculous.  It is to keep everyone in the dark and investors in the dark.,
"Reveille Geroninians!!! Premarket trades began at 4:27 am EST. Cmon Lev no rest for the weary, another big day on hand.",
"To be sure, it looks as if R/R patients will benefit from Imetelstat. However, I have always wondered how the drug would fare in a hypothetical frontline MF trial in terms of overall survival.",
"I need a good night's sleep. At this point I may say stupid things so, good night!",
I think it's about before the 4.7 ARM being meaningful now ? The original plan after the first internal 12 week peek was to gage the converted group results separately from the 9.4 group that was communicated as the correct dosage for the rest of the trial. 4.7 dosing was no longer anything they cared much about and the converted group was being monitored separately but the 9.4 ARM was the holy grail.,
"By the way....I'm not even sure the FDA can look at any results from the 4.7 patients, whether or not they migrated to 9.4. That part of the trial was closed.JNJ and Geron would definitely have an interest however.",
"Maybe JNJ has a dilemma with the lymphomas. Imbruvica is a big deal for them, a multi-billion dollar big deal. It's already been shown that Venetoclax is approved as a lymphoma drug. Can it be taken with Imbruvica? Does anyone know?Would JNJ test Imetelstat with Venetoclax at the expense of Imbruvica? Definitely for the Myeloid diseases, but CLL? Some day we may find a Venet/Imet therapy for solid tumors but I really wonder how quickly JNJ would act on the lymphomas, for obvious reasons. Abbvie also has a say in this as they own both Venetoclax and half of Imbruvica. It's a convoluted web of interest we have here. That's why my interest is in the solid tumors. JNJ would have no qualms about testing the BCL-2 inhibitor and Imetelstat against solid tumors. AML is almost a certainty but if Imetelstat is to become a platform drug it may need to jump the cancers.",
"OK, so number one cannot be.Scarlett already said none of the 4.7 patients will be included in any part of the ImBark trial. They can measure median survival of this group but whether they are still on 4.7 or 9.4 they are not included in the ImBark trial results. The trial results are based only on the 100 or so patients that received 9.4 from day one.I will ask Scarlett tomorrow but it is almost certain that they will not take the average of the two groups and present any ImBark update on those numbers. ImBark is, for all practical purposes, a trial of about 100 patients that started taking 9.4 initially.That doesn't mean the results of the 4.7 patients are not being researched, even for estimated time of survival. They are just not part of the ImBark trial and it's highly unlikely they would take an average of the two groups and present it as an update on the trial.I would think the 19 months is only referring to the 9.4 patients.",
Yes it is and all of this MDS frontline and MF backline leading to MF frontline and likely AML is a very BFD !!! The market and analysts just are not getting it yet. Are we just seeing IMET work better the longer it's administered and that it can step down in doseage/toxicity really well in MF ? Isn't that a great selling point to the FDA ? Isn't that a great maintenance potential drug ? This thing could be just bigger than all of us !,
"FYI....I spoke with Phil following today's update, and he offered a couple of good thoughts that I wanted to pass along....1)  The median follow-up time of ~19 months (as of January) is an average of the median times associated with the 4.7mg/kg and 9.4mg/kg patients.   Given the final 10-15 patients all went into the 9.4mg/kg arm, we can conclude the median follow-up time of the 4.7mg patients exceeds that of the 9.4mg patients.   Phil estimates ~2 months difference between the two groups.  Thus, the median follow-up time associated with the 4.7mg patients was likely ~21 months as of January and will be ~24 months as of end-March.2)  Phil reminded me the market size for Myelofibrosis has most recently been estimated as $2.5B per year.....with the increased market size estimate ($1.0B -> $2.5B) being a function of people living longer, improved disease awareness, and improved diagnosis methods.   He feels the increased market size projections played a significant role in Celgene's willingness to pay-up for the Fedratinib asset.   Thus, as we're modeling potential MF revenues, we should utilize the new market size estimates.",
"I think the number one question will be what is the significance of the closing end of June date?Also, I'll see if I can get some clarity on JNJ's interest in the patents for Venet/Imet and are they also testing solid tumors (are they trying to get patents there too?). Can an AML trial begin before reaching the closing date on ImBark?Maybe they can explain why the numbers changed from about a year to 14-16 months, rather then I try to find it in the paperwork she sent.Send me some questions and I may not get to all of them but I'll try.",
"This is like Dr S. gave us a word puzzle to solve. Not fun, but we have to :-)",
"Anna told me she and Chip can call me earlier today:Krassowska, Anna (akrassowska@Geron.com)To:you DetailsEd,We can call you now if that is convenient?  Can you let me know which number to call you on? Best,AnnaI was actually too busy to see this on my private email.She then sent 3 estimates of survival for this group, one was for 13 months, the other 14 months, and the third was so damn complicated I still haven't figured it out.I'll see if I can talk to them tomorrow so maybe throw me some questions. I have a few of my own. I'm glad I didn't do this today. Too tired and not really ready.",
"Prior to the presentation of IMerge data at last year's ASH data, I mentioned the headline TI response rate wasn't going to tell the whole story because some patients were likely to realize a significant reduction in their transfusion burden without meeting the >8-week TI threshold.   Now, from today's discussion, we were provided this nugget of information:""It’s also worth noting that almost all patients experienced some reduction in transfusion burdened with the average relative transfusion burdened being reduced by approximately two-thirds compared to baseline levels. Also the rate of greater than eight week red blood cell transfusion independence did not differ based on the presence of ring sideroblasts indicating activity of imetelstat across different subtypes of MDS.""Why is this important?   Because it means that nearly 100% of MDS patients would benefit in a meaningful manner.   Furthermore, with Janssen recognizing an opportunity to place imetelstat as frontline (prior to HMAs and Lenolidomide), you can assume Imetelstat would be prescribed to a very high percentage of all MDS patients post-ESAs.   Revenue potential would be quite significant as a result.   This is why the IMerge trial was given 'top billing' in the recent press release....much to George Budwell's dismay.Conclusion:   Our MDS opportunity is a BFD!!!",
we need to move to another article by the way.,
"As I recall, Dr. Tefferi's observed 'Stable Disease' rate (CR+PR+CI) was reported as 64%.   With that in mind, ask yourself how long does it take to reach median survival if ~60% of your patients achieve 'stable disease'?  Along these lines.....you might recall Joanne's relative health while responding at the CI level.  She was healthy enough for international family vacations before she was required to drop-off treatment as a result of the FDA hold.   She declined quickly after being removed from the Mayo pilot study of Imetelstat.",
What if they were thinking we know that median overall survival could take a long time to reach and we are going to do the analysis when 25 of the 100 patients have passed away and extrapolate when median survival may be reached from there.  Why else would you just come out and say we expect based on the rate of deaths for median OS to be reached by the end of 2Q?  why play possum with that number?,
"I want to clarify something if I can about the MF ARMs. Originally we had the low-dose 4.7 ARM and the high-dose ARM 9.4. After the 12 week peek review, the intent was to close enrollment of the low dose ARM and convert those patients over to 9.4 at investigator discretion and patient willingness. I think the expectations at the time and up until last Friday, was that all or almost all converted. The converted group was to be tracked separately from the 9.4 ARM.This essentially meant the low-dose ARM was no more. What apparently happened to our surprise, is that a meaningful number of 4.7 patients did not convert making the low-dose ARM I guess meaningful again allowing for a longer time beyond 12 weeks obviously. So now we do have apparently Two ARMS again that are meaningful and a separately tracked converted population. All the ARMS are closed to enrollment. So yes, we do have 3 distinct groupings for information analysisSo when Scarlett says BOTH ARMS have not reached median OS, I think technically he means the pure 4.7 and the pure 9.4 populations. I do not know how the converted group factored into his statements. What is the OS differences between each ARM and the converted group ? Are they seeing any meaningful OS or CI differences ? Possibly the stage is being set for a step up or step down in dosing for backline and more certainly for a frontline MF drug. Any thoughts ? Does this interpretation seem correct ?",
"I asked Anna how the rate of deaths affects primary analysis and if they expect to have reached a certain amount of deaths by end of 2Q and that is why they expect the analysis to be done.  She said as stated before, they expect the primary analysis to be done when a certain number of deaths have occurred in the trial but haven't said what that number is.  she responded in like 5 minutes via email.   This also is open to interpretation that possibly the primary analysis isn't being some when 50 percent of the patients have passed away and perhaps they tied the analysis to a lower or higher patient death total.  Why they have to play cute around this number is ridiculous.",
they could wait for median overall survival but not for overall survival.  They would be waiting years like the Mayo trial,
"also,why would Geron say in the press release that based on the rate of deaths that protocol analysis will be performed including OS (if they thought that median would be reached by then) but later say that the trial has been modified to allow continues to continue in trial and data to be gathered so that overall survival can be measured?  doesn't seem like they expect to have that data by end of 2Q.",
"here is my take on the whole median OS.  Recall that Tefferi said Imet works great for about 20 percent of MF patients, not as great for 80 percent.  The majority had some benefit.  Some do not respond at all.  The median overall survival may improve but maybe not dramatically.  However I suspect that for 20 percent of patients, it will work very well and overall survival (not median) will be significantly better.  Remember we still have an ongoing Mayo clinic trials years later.",
today was a nice day..but for the life me..I just can't understand why this stock is not in the teens...,
"Regardless of their real meaning here, they could be wrong on their projections or expectations and the median OS could go longer than 23 or 24 months. This would be a good question for Anna to get a translation to the meaning. Are they expecting median OS to be reached by the end of June 2018 ? Or is it that they feel they have enough OS benefit by end of June to do the primary analysis and OS appears to be taking too long ? Please clarify. Also is the OS benefit almost the same between the converted 4.7/9.4 group and the 9.4 ARM ? since median OS has not been reached in either ARM ? Or are they talking about the 4.7 original ARM population ?",
That was my impression. Also I think bp's and jayfish I think.,
"Is it safe to assume that the statement ""Based on the rate of deaths"" we can conclude that they believe Median OS will be reached by the end of the 2nd Quarter?",
"Olivia “it was in October 2016. That's when Janssen did the first data review and it was at that time determined that the low-dose arm, the 4.7 mg/kg, didn't warrant further investigation. So patient enrollment in that arm was closed. A protocol amendment was processed at that time giving the investigators the option whether to leave their 4.7 patients on that arm, or they could dose-escalate to 9.4.That was based on investigator choice.Chip “So that was toward the end of 2016 and that's when some patients dose escalated up to 9.4 but there were a meaningful number of patients who remained on 4.7. So did that answer your question?”In oct 2016, at that time the 4.7 low dose arm didn’t warrant further investigation. New patients at that time were only enrolled  in the high dose arm. you could leave the low dose arm at the investigators choice. Based on chips comment that a meaningful number stayed on 4.7 and it’s continuing so it’s possible this group may be benefiting more than expected over a longer period of time.. there may have been a signal to keep some on the lower dose and now some 4.7 arm patients ARE seeing benefits. It may be taking longer. There may be less adverse affects at the lower dose so this may be a big deal. That’s why moving to the higher dose was  at the “investigators choice”. This may be significant as less adverse affects means more patient compliance and possible less dose management. just speculating..",

"Repost from Imetelchat:In the interest of parsimony I will summarize my thoughts in as few words as possible.  Several board members in other forums have requested that I do so butI I think most of what I say has been discussed among many excellent posters. Fish has asked that I assume a co moderator position on his very excellent board which I am happy to do.  I encourage folks to take advantage of his catalogue of pertinent studies and excellent discussions.  I would ask for three things: civility, brevity and pertinence. So to todays cc:For MF: 1. The obvious: OS is outstanding in R/R and median survival has not been reached but SVR etc. not like front line studies with Jakafi.  2. There are still patients in the low dose group.  3. Primary analysis begins Q2 (that's pretty soon) 4. The continuation decision occurs before the end of Q3 (that's pretty soon too).  5. Multiple indications suggest there will be a positive continuation decision (my opinion only) which triggers 65M milestone, they will also have internal data re MDS by then.  6.  The CT site will probably be up dated soon so we can see the wording of the addendum that allows continuation of the R/R study well beyond the original stop date (my opinion).  7. No new clinical data until ASH--patience. 8. The continuation decision could conceivably come sooner than ASH (end of third quarter), this is material so I don't know how they can wait until after ASH. 9. Waffled on phase III study (my and other posters interpretation as you know has been there will not be one.)For MDS: 1. Excellent data as all know especially in sub group which especially pertains to European patients who it was implied will be targeted for front line therapy.  2. No data until ASH, additional 20 patients enrolled quickly which almost certainly allows for ASH presentation and start of randomized study.   3. If you haven't listened to Dr. Raza you are not doing your homework.  No mention of AML or combination studies.  Likely for competitive reasons.  We know the basic science data is very strong and there may be multiple indications hinted by recent patent filing.  Please feel free to add to list or add criticisms.  The past week has been very strong for Geron.  Best wishes to all, bp",
"“So in order to continue to follow patients, we just needed to amend the protocol get approved through ethics committees and so forth. So that’s really I would say the principal driver.And obviously the reason we wanted to do that is because we still have not seen median survival reached in either of the arms or either the original arms in the study. So we’d like to continue at least through that point of time. So that really dictates the protocol amendment predominantly one of timing.”I am still confused by the above passages. “We’d like to continue at least through that point of time” to get to the median OS?Thank you Dr Jay!",

"Sage, I went back to review sdraw's comment to see if I could clarify what I was thinking and respond in a better way to you too.  Here's what was said""Read the language, here. That last part about collecting data “to the extent possible, until death...” meaning, they don’t expect to reach median OS even by the end of the primary analysis. And they will continue to collect that data to determine OS beyond the trial.""Median OS means that half the patients are gone.  To me I read this as the amendment was required to take care of those that would still presumably be alive even after the primary analysis was done, or the original projected study date was extended (?triggered by reaching median OS or by reaching Q3 if median OS not yet reached).  It would be pretty hard to say median OS will not be reached by Q3 since in the words the great Yogi Berra, ""its difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.""  Again I truly hope Sdraw is right. He has made some amazing observations and I really value and pay close attention to what he thinks.  It does seem that JS is preparing us for some stellar survival statistics.  Also the point others have made about EMA approval coming out of left field has not been lost on me.  Very much enjoy our discussions here.  Best Regards to all.  Time to let Ed ask some real questions during one of these conference calls.  bp",

Completely agree Sarg. Thank you all for creating a special ecosystem. To the moon!,
It’s even more important that the analyst ask these very relevant questions since ordinary investors (us little folks no matter how many shares we own) are prohibited from doing so.

"BP,It looks like that sdrawkcabeman was correct after all, if you listen the conference call between 24 minutes and 25 minutes, I quote:“Not seen Median survival reached in either of the original arms, we would like to continue to through that point of time” That was the answer about the amendment.That would put median OS pass over 24 months.Thanks",
Data desert until ASH. We will have the continuation decision before then,
"Something I got from the 3/19/18 call.  About 10% of the roughly 100 subjects in IMBark are R/R after JAK inhibitors other than ruxo (mostly momelotinib).  All of these non-ruxo JAK inhibitors have had problems with off-target adverse effects (that's mostly why they aren't licensed) (since Tefferi was once a momelotinib fan, and he showed some haste in pulling subjects off drug at his site in the ruxolitinib phase 1, we can doubt that one or two were even R/R by ordinary standards), so it is possible that discontinuers had MF less severe than seen in ruxo discontinuers.   Combined with the unknown effects of requiring an ECOG performance score of 2 or better and a minimum platelet count at enrollment, that makes approval of imetelstat for MF treatment, even as second line. more dependent on having simultaneous matched controls.With at least 5 ongoing studies among Incyte, Novartis and outsiders aimed at broadening and lengthening ruxo response, the R/R MF bullseye figures to be pretty small by the time imetelstat might aim at it.",

"I’m  continually surprised at just how bad the analyst are on these conference calls – which is a little surprising given Jakafi is a billion dollar drug.

JS may have elected not to answer that question but it at least should have been asked. -	Sargasso",
Piper Jaffray analyst Charles Duncan raised his price target for Geron to $7 after the company this morning reported year-end 2017 cash of $109M and provided an update on its IMerge and IMbark studies. The analyst projects the current cash will fund Geron's operations into 2020. He's encouraged by the update on the IMbark study in myelofibrosis and reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares.,

Hello everbody!  Is anyone here short?,
Median OS has no right side boundaries. Only long term data will revel how many on the right side of the Median OS are still surviving. For practical reasons it is better to use Median OS. That's why JS doesn't mention how many exactly are surviving.,

I understand you were spooked once by an unruly question of a private investor but I work in a public arena and you've know me for quite some time.I've discovered that of the very few analysts that currently follow Geron, some, if not many, do not have a great deal of knowledge on the company or the drug. To keep others away from asking questions does not seem right. After all these years and with the knowledge I've gained, I should have been allowed to ask questions.Thanks,  Ed",
Buyers...be wary of a slow melt down and then a big sell-off later today.,

I had a pretty good 2 questions based mostly on the patents around the Venet/Imet combo, I think that one private investor who once went crazy spooked the company into allowing only (pretty clueless) analysts to ask questions. And to think I hardly slept for this.I'm seeing $3.82 bid so the best thing that can happen right now is a split second drop to close the $3.69 gap and a rise the rest of the day, and week.",

The 9.4 group will live longer than the 4,7 and the latter group which has already outlived projected OS.  Good news and the first clarity as to the size of the 4.7 group.  They must have had some good responses for these patients to elect to remain in the lower dose group.  bp",
"Not much more than the Friday reveal today. I liked that a “meaningful” number of patients remain in the 4.7 arm. I believe this indicates the 4.7 is the second arm so often referred to as still demonstrating ongoing survival. So, a significant number of 4.7 have survived 19 months and are continuing on. This raising of the bar to 14-16 months seemed rather vague.I found it confusing about when OS might be achieved. First he seemed to indicate they projected OS being reached at end of 2nd quarter this year. Then he said the Primary Analysis would begin at the start of the 2nd quarter. Are we not right now about two weeks from the start of the second quarter?  That may have been an error on his part, like when he said all 20 new MDS patients were enrolled by November 2018, after saying the enforcement occurred faster than expected.",
How are you gonna play this? Sell and buy back a part of your position?,

It's obvious these conferences are being restricted to analysts who really don't know a great deal about Geron.I kept pressing ""star 1"" and never got a response. When I signed on the operator even told me I would be able to ask questions. I think I may have opened some eyes regarding the Venet/Imet combo and the patents. Am I upset about this? Yes!!!!On another note, the odds of closing this morning's gap at $3.69 are really high; however, the news should keep Geron going up as we still seem to be grossly undervalued compared to many small biotech's that don't have nearly the potential Geron has.Imetelstat stands to become a platform drug for many different cancer indications, including solid tumors.

I benefited from his brazen dishonesty of exaggerating the potential of company's future revenues, by being lucky and  sell 15000 shares purchased between $2.5 and $4 at  $55+ few cents from the top. But the 5000 shares that I held for longer term ended up worthless in couple of years after DNDN went belly up! My point being that even the slickest of crooked CEOs will end of getting exposed in the end and thus hurting the shareholders. I saw many people lives that was tragically ruined by his dishonesty and greed. Lets stick with JS's non-exaggerating style.",
"Yes...bp is right! It's highly unlikely any more 4.7's remain, but those that switched to 9.4 have not reached median survival but are not included in the trial results.",
"134, JS has never clarified as to whether when he refers to ""both"" arms, he means ( in the first case) those that stayed in the 4.7 arm or those that started there and were later crossed into the 9.4 arm.  The significance of the 4.7 arm (before cross over) could be that is some sense it is a comparator arm (not quite a control arm).  It couldn't have been that good because they abandoned that dose arm. Clearly 9.4 was superior by then. I can't imagine many patients stayed in the 4.7 arm voluntarily once given a chance to get the (presumably) more effect higher dose.  bp",
"Just had a thought: Since either arm (4.7 or 9.4 mg/kg) have yet to reach median OS, is it possible that it is only the 4.7 arm median OS expected to be reached by end of Q2 and trigger primary analysis? Else, why would JS keep bringing up that the lower dose is also still going? What's the significance in the trial context? JS is usually very tight with words careful with his updates. I think there is a larger significance related with 4.7mg/kg dose that's not so obvious and but is very important.",

"I’ve read the observations of George twice and they still don’t make any sense to me. Concerning median overall survival he notes:“That extremely encouraging update should have been front and center in the press release.”So does George believe that investors are incapable of reading the entire press release and if this information is not found at the top of the release investors will somehow miss it?George further notes:“If Geron's management, for instance, felt confident that J&J was, in fact, pleased with the progress so far, then they probably wouldn't have put out such a tepid press release”Excuse me? If at this late date GERN is not confident about how JNJ feels about Imet they never will be. Furthermore if GERN is not confident about how JNJ feels about Imet why did they state in the release that the Continuation decision will occur by the end of the third quarter of 2018? Methinks George is not a reliable reporter.-	Sargasso",
"I hope to hear any inclinations towards CI's on top of OS improvement. Anything on FDA matters. His tone, is it upbeat ? Will there be any surprises at this point not in the 8K ?Anything around acceleration talk. Is IMERGE on target for analysis end of second quarter or 3rd quarter ? Are they projecting median OS in IMBARK before end of 3rd quarter ? 2nd Quarter ?",

Always enjoy your posts jayfish,
I am all for JS keeping a low profile. God forbid he gives the lawyers a reason to tie Geron up in court for the next few years.,
"I have donned the GS as of this AM and therefore hope to avoid problems with delayed response (see Yale study). I expect Anon Wiz will arrange for George C. to go against his impulse to sell and run. I would be quite surprised (like I was Friday AH) if Geron or Dr. S. said anything more definitive or said anything with more than blah excitement. If he breaks tradition, he might reluctantly divulge that we are now in uncharted waters with OS and are interested in what that might mean in terms of effectiveness of Imetelstat. I expect him to acknowledge (only if he is asked) that FDA has not pulled the plug, but not to say anything positive about that.",

"I see George is at it again.  He really should read this board a little more carefully and definitely pay MTB royalties (plus milestones).  So to Monday's call.  Have been thinking about what Scarlett is saving up his sleeve.  1. FDA approval? That would be a long shot but is definitely coming 2. Opt in? He has been pretty transparent re the requirement for primary analysis first 3. A partnership with Abbvie/Janssen/Geron that is bigger than all of us ? Don't be surprised but it won't be tomorrow.  4.  This statement-- and here's what my money is on: ""Outcome measures for efficacy, including spleen volume responses and reductions in Total Symptom Score remain consistent with the prior data reviews."" Since no one has ever lived this long in the R/R group the effect on spleens (and multiple others symptom categories) has NEVER been accessible or assessable. Now it is.  I think this is the information being saved for tomorrow.  One thing George said was that had Geron just changed their wording a little we would be in the double digits.  He might actually be right once we start getting more info.  I do think numbers 1 thru 3 are the next dominos to fall.  Good luck fellow boarders and I am grateful for the thoughtful discussion that takes place here.  bp",

"Sweeten the pot a little further.  Even if median survival is exceeded based on the 12 month benchmark by 6 months, if there is a PR (or God willing a CR) in the remaining population then that will have been established outside of the Mayo Trial and in a R/R population.  Such an event would be so scientifically significant that it would reverberate through the blood cancer world. I’m not saying it happened, but that would be truly outstanding if it did.  Going from R/R to cleared marrow wouldn’t be tantamount to a cure, it would be a cure.And guess what? We may yet hear that after all this time Imetelstat has been able to be effective enough on the bone marrow to now hit the spleen endpoints.  That would be incredible news and perhaps make a strong case for superseding Jakafi with Imetelstat much earlier than relapse.  I’m not saying frontline just yet, but patients with declining results from Jakafi may be moved to Imetelstat sooner than a relapse. That would be amazing and would not require approval for frontline.",
"The last we heard from Scarlett, 12 months was being used as the median OS for the R/R MF population. I'm anxious to see if Scarlett is still pushing that figure (Janssen really) which would also be the median OS pushed to the FDA or maybe already agreed as the target to beat. So as lev says, you can figure IMET has doubled the median OS. Isn't that very significant ? Plus, we know we are getting other clinical improvements even though we don't know the details but the total symptomatic score has to be better than nothing at all using jakafi as a baseline of zero (does essentially nothing for the R/R population where its  toxicity is not worth it). There is no other baseline. Let's see: the patients live twice as long or more plus obtain some Clinical Improvements. There is no competition for R/R MF. How should the FDA decide ? Does the FDA walk away ? How could they ? Since there is no phase 3 design for Imbark, and this population is critical, how could there not be an acceleration (BTD) and a NDA ? Hard to imagine anything else.So here's a thought: Why not accelerate approval for IMET for R/R MF (backline) while initiating a phase 2/3 frontline MF CT where IMET is likely to have its greatest impact before patients progress to more serious MF, all the while getting the phase 3 data accomplished in a frontline approach. It's the best of both worlds. R/R MF patients get immediate access and frontline MF moves faster and deeper into the data. This is what I hope we eventually see here as the JNJ MF approach. There is no way we get a backline approval and not pursue frontline as well and frontline is where Janssen can provide a MF phase 2/3 design.",
"Welcome back crystal........Hope your son is doing well. And Carrie, hope your daughter is bouncing back. I know your dad would have loved to know that Imetelstat is extending lives.KC Kid.....you still around?Which brings me to what I believe is a statistical certainty:2 + 2 = 4, not 3, not 5. I don't think one can make this any more clear. If you have 2 apples and someone gives you 2 more, you will have 4 (unless you ate one).In January, median survival of the patients in ImBark had reached 19 months, and probably are at 21 months today. Think about this, if the FDA believes in JNJ's figures regarding the current survival of these patients, and it's almost a certainty they will, then all things considered, Imetelstat has already reached approvable status. I've thought about this over-and-over, we've already reached the pinnacle of success which is everything Imetelstat needs to get approved. I think in the history of cancer, if the estimated maximum survival is one year, and a drug comes along to practically double that short duration, that drug must be approved. I think for the first time in Geron's history, we have proof of survival much longer then otherwise.It's not like me to put a stamp on something without hedging my bets but If these results are real, the chance of Imet not being approved is practically nil. Fridays update was ""everything"" we ever wanted, or needed. The chance of Geron opening higher and keeping on trucking Monday are outstanding. Just keep asking this question, what are the chances of doubling survival (at least) and JNJ ""not"" issuing a positive continuation decision? None !!!!",
"I thought this may be interesting to some newbies. There is top shelf poster on a lesser board named Sdrawkcabeman. 11 months ago he posted this (full disclosure-he was not responding to me) ‘I agree wholeheartedly with much of what you said.  GERN is indeed at the cutting edge, and, moreover, no one else is competitive.  The IP, alone, contains several further generations of technology to be explored.And I agree that if there is any M&A talk, it will come suddenly.  But the valuation of $30B is premature, that would reflect approval in multiple indications; which I fully expect for Imet, but multiple indications (beyond blood) is a bit further down the line.  I think, realistically, if there's an early buyout we would see north of $10B for approval in MF/MDS; and approval in blood is just on the horizon.  Also, if there's a buyout, I firmly believe it would be JNJ; they've already shouldered the burden of development, there's no reason they would set that foundation to let a competitor build on it.And lastly, regarding GERN's acquisition target, Imet already fits the profile of exactly what they're looking for.  Why not pursue the independent development plan, then?  I don't know how seriously they're looking for an acquisition.  Aside from a buyout, I think there are plenty of further opportunities in Imet.’Add in PTCA, Fisherman, Hoosier, Anonymous Wizard, BP, Sargasso, Jayfish, Huntington, MedTechBio, Out of Ignorance and  you have the core of where you should focus your message board DD. Many thanks to these guys. Sorry if I forgot anyone.",

"No.  Milestones pleural. The only one we know for sure is 65 M for opt in by J and J.  The others probably spread over several years for things like starting AML study, MF approval, other indications etc.  This is not a lump sum payment.  bp",

"sdrawkcabeman re-postLet's look at this realistically. They did a MF pilot which resulted unprecedented CRs and PRs, the ET trial had stunning CRs, and the MDS trials (the pilot and Imerge) are breaking new ground as we speak. And now we have news that Rux R/R pts have greater than 19 months median OS (and counting) for a pop that otherwise would succumb to the injustice of this disease in just 6 months. That's not even counting the stunning preclinicals and the program targeting AML.Any reasonable person can see that we are deep, deep in approval territory, which is the same as saying realistically we are looking at a positive continuation decision, and all the schedule of payments that will come with that... THIS year.If Imet extends R/R pts' OS significantly (as they've just announced), then the chances that the FDA rejects an NDA are virtually zero, IMO. With median OS at 19 months so far, what will OS be? I think such a very significant median OS advantage would suffice for approval. But why stop there? I wonder, if Imet extends OS in the R/R pop, then what might it do in the frontline MF pop? Oh, yeah, that's right, they already did that in the pilot and saw unprecedented CRs.I think when you see the totality of the program with results like these, the natural course of action will be to get approval for R/R followed closely by a supplemental for frontline. I don't think it necessarily frees them from having to do a P3 in frontline; after all, clinical candidates can still be marketed in P3. And the FDA may want to cover itself for indemnity sake. For us, investors, it might be a moot point if Andrew is right and Imet is approved with Imbark.Imet's journey has had its share of twists and turns, and I'd say even a fair bit of mystery aside from the unpredictability. But we're finally here and going into the primary analysis with the certain knowledge that they're seeing significant OS benefit. Way to put the wind under our wings with that PR! Monday will be exciting!",
"My question is why the Monday morning CC? I'm pleasantly surprised with Friday's release. IMO nothing at all negative. So, why not the CC Friday afternoon? Perhaps like others have said I'm looking too much into it but is the CC just for some clarification? Imo I think there is more to it. Maybe news in regards to AML or BTD? Either way my thought that I might sweat this weekend out was completely wrong and I'm happy about that! GLL",
The final median OS of the trial would be at:22 months +/- by one month.Will update if any new information released on Monday’s call.,
Tough to say at this point what Imetelstat’s role will ultimately play in using it in combinations to treat solid tumors etc. I wonder if it could ever be used in a combination to treat breast cancer. That would be a big market I’d think.,
"it’s not easy giving up the golden goose that has filled the accounts of this management team for many years and decades. Million dollar salary for the CEO, others making several hundred thousand, year end hundred thousand dollar bonus and raises while J&J is doing 98% of the work. It’s time the little guy or gal, the shareholder gets a return. acquiring another drug will dilute the share price and success of imetelstat. This will be a significant conflict of interest if management goes in this direction after this data report. No need to diversify!",
"the management at Geron, acting in the best interests of the shareholders, should negotiate a buyout with J&J, no secondaries and dilution, no building the the pipeline and spending more of the shareholders cash, no added risks by starting a new drug development, it’s over - sell the company for cash so shareholders finally get a return after decades of loses",
We as followers have seen the stock run up and then fall after news before. Many people pilled on this recent rise but could not stomach the possibility of that happening again. The huge stock price rise needed to back off but now with new followers and this news I think we see it over 5 very soon. We could really not have achieved better results and those that sold on the way up will likely try get back in.,
Any reason why the big dip end of day and then high volume spike in AH? It seems to me the traders want both sides of this stock. I know options were part of it. Has this ever happened before?,
Again thanks for all the thoughts and scientific ideas. By now many of us diehards have read and reread the earnings and updates. As you see from all the comments we have many new and excited fans of GERN. It is obvious some are absent and hope they are okay. If not they likely know what hit them Friday is going to hit them harder Monday. I hope we open in the mid to high 3 area but I do not think that is likely. This news we received was better than I hoped for. Not only for me but the multiple friends and family and patients that deserved it. I think we still have time to let people know what we have here and you ask what is that? A stock that just started its ascent to much higher valuations over the next year and with the news we received I think anything in the area below 5 is still a gift. I think most of the smarter people on this board of which there are many knew that and have tried to tell us. With the update it will open many new eyes. I see upgrades and a much much much higher prices.So I end with a HUGE THANKS to all of those writers and posters who opened my eyes. Like I have said many times maybe the best risk reward stock of all time and the risk is lower today.  GLL,
"Ed, You may have found the aspirin combo for all solid tumors.  This could be something that they should hopefully test",
"They don't have to wait Lsv............According to CKTC most BTD's come near the end of phase II's, right where we are today..The big question here is how could the 4.7 group ""not"" have reached median survival? I wonder if they are basing that on those 4.7's who migrated to 9.4? I guess it would be hard to believe any 4.7's, who were told that 9.4 works, would have simply said they didn't want to convert. OK, I think I just answered my own question. Sometimes it helps to think out loud.A very, very long time ago, I read that there was an enzyme that started to express itself around mutated cells. This enzyme started an avalanche of proliferation among these cell mutations. Where would these cells be if not for this enzyme? They would not exist, very simply. This was the logic behind developing a method of stopping this enzyme in its tracks.The key was to develop a method of doing this. The theory was simple but had to be first developed, then put to the test. At this point in time the theory seems to be proving itself.Let's go one step further and remember the Yale Studies. The conclusion was to combine a telomerase inhibitor with a tumor suppressor. The result was to enhance the p53 gene by rejuvenation of the immune system. A thought just came to my mind. Isn't that what Venetoclax does, suppress tumors by inhibiting BCL-2, where the result is to enhance the immune system?Read this:Expression in diseaseThe dynamic role of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, among other proteins, may alter the significance of increased BCL-2 expression in human disease. However, the wide variety of cancer types associated with aberrant expression of BCL-2 is consistent with its role as an apoptotic regulator .BCL-2 expression in leukemiaLess than 5% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia harbor a detectable BCL-2 gene rearrangement, although the vast majority overexpress BCL-2. Increased expression of BCL-2 is also found frequently in acute myeloid leukemia and in nearly all patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia.BCL-2 expression in non-Hodgkin lymphomaIn follicular lymphoma, an estimated 90% of patients harbor a t(14;18) chromosomal translocation in tumor cells, which is thought to cause overexpression of BCL-2 protein. More than 40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients were categorized as having relatively high BCL-2 expression.BCL-2 expression in solid tumorsBCL-2 may also play a role in non-hematologic tumors, and inappropriate expression has been observed in solid tumors such as prostate, breast, and small cell and non-small cell lung cancers. In small cell lung cancer, high BCL-2 expression in >90% of patients has been reported. Ovarian, neuroblastoma, bladder, colorectal, and some head and neck cancers have all exhibited significant levels of BCL-2 expression.I believe Imetelstat may work with other drugs which ultimately work on restoration of the immune system. The damaging enzyme is inhibited simultaneously as the body's immune system is restored enough to fight the cancer. It may always take a telomerase inhibitor to help fight that battle. In the case of AML a BCL-2 inhibitor may allow the immune system to recover to the point where, simultaneously, a telomerase inhibitor can do the mopping.If this theory is correct, the combination of Venetoclax and Imetelstat may play a roll in the therapy of other cancer indications. Even though any drugs that work on restoring the immune system can work with Imetelstat, Venetoclax inhibits BCL-2, which is also expressed in solid tumors. It's in The Yale Studies. Once again, if this theory makes sense, Venetoclax may allow Imetelstat to be used in non-hematological cancers because they also may express the BCL-2 gene. Venetoclax works only to inhibit BCL-2 while Imetelstat may work on almost any cancer; however, Imetelstat needs a boost against solid tumors, and Venetoclax may give it that boost. By inhibiting the BCL-2 gene in tumors, it may give Imetelstat a chance to get rid of ""the time lag"" associated with solid tumors.I'd be curious if anyone can name ONE enzyme that forms around almost all cancer cell mutations and is responsible for the splitting of those cells. We can go around and around but always come back to the need to inhibit telomerase. The only pre-requisite is the combination must not be toxic. Inhibiting BCL-2 and telomerase may be more powerful than we think.",
"Great news today.Does FDA typically wait for trial to complete before granting a BTD/AA ? Appreciate if anyone can enlighten us on the process here. If data is this strong, why the wait from FDA given that the patient set (for MF) is extremely sick?",
"MedTechBio. Im calling you out. If not for your articles I wouldnt have a position in this gem.I had read articles prior with a short spin but didnt do my own research until I read your articles. Your views promted my research, and what I found was enough to make me a believer.Thank you sir.",

Up $.25 in after-hours to $3.62.,
"While most of us are feeling pretty good about things there are a couple more little tidbits to consider:By closing the trial at the end of the second quarter and still researching OS JNJ has decreased the time of decision by the FDA. Telling the FDA we've reached our trial limit so here is the data, two things can happen. The FDA at the very least may allow BTD for MF and/or the FDA can approve Imetelstat for R/R patients. BOTH are outstanding events as it would trigger an immediate positive continuation decision by JNJ. On a short-horizon (next week), filling in the $3.14 gap means we may not have to look back. That quick decline near the end of the day was a wonderful event. I had visions of a long, drawn-out corrective process and while that can still happen, we can also open near $3.69 in the AM and keep going up. The news is out! Very little can be said Monday to change this. Most of the questions Scarlett gets Monday will simply ask for clarification of what has already been said.If I can I may want to bring up the AML story, and see if we can get more answers on the filing of the patent and a potential new trial. For example, will this be a phase II trial?We just went through probably the most significant update in Geron's history and passed with flying colors. It's going to be a great weekend!!!!",
As I posted before the announcement : Monday is not a big deal. Don’t get all worked up. We haven’t reached OS or we would have been notified. Monday’s conference has been on the agenda for a while. The TELL is out. Don’t panic now and miss out. Don’t listen to all the NOISE.  That’s it in a nut shell. Ride it out. IT IS ALL GOOD.,

"There was a time on this Geron board that most items needed to be explained. No longer!There are so many experienced and knowledgeable people here, physicists, chemists, doctors, company owners, scientists, ag. experts, financiers, advisors, etc., etc., etc., it seems all we need to do is read the posts and information pops out, more than can be received from any analyst (of which they are few and far between).Not only was the news better than expected, but we received more than we even thought we would. Geron is up $.20 in after hours and what more could we ask? Last I see is $3.57.Notwithstanding Anna's warning about mature data, they literally spelled out (at the end of January) 19 months beyond median survival. Hey wait! They were not supposed to be so specific!!I would still like to see the start of an AML trial and BTD for MF but what we saw today points to that. I would think we may want to ask about the Filing for patents on the Venet/Imet combo.We do not have to wait on pins-and-needles for the Monday conference because most of what we wanted to know has already been told. Seriously, even the continuation decision deadline has been accelerated. Maybe this move we've seen is real. We may have turned an important corner in the Geron story as it is now being proven that inhibiting telomerase can help people live longer with cancer. Let's continue to extend patents on certain combinations and we may finally be turning the page and becoming a growth stock.Turtle Island never looked so close. GERONimo!!",
"“Approximately 19 months” “based on a January 2018 data cut” I think I may only missed the median enrollment time estimation only by a few days as I have stated 20 months by the end of January cutoff, I am proud of myself, but not surprised :-)The key word, once again, in the release, “the median overall survival has not been reached in either dosing arm”, that sends a message to all those listening.Even the move up to the end of second quarter is expected, if you look at those graphs carefully, whether it is the 7 month one or the 14 month one, the slopes are quite steep for RR MF patients.I fully expect the positive continuation decision from JNJ.Looking forward to the third quarter, we can only go up from here, shorts may stage something next week, but the trend is firmly going up.Good luck all, imetelstat has casted its final vote with a green Go.Thanks",
"Hm, almost 408;000 shares traded after hours up till now.",
"from Yahooboard sdrawkcabeman 54 minutes agoSo Imbark’s third internal review was of data from Jan 2018, at which time median OS still hasn’t been reached at median 19 months. I think we can actually infer an even longer OS benefit b/c of several statements in the PR:“Patients who remain in the treatment phase may continue to receive imetelstat, and until the primary analysis, all safety and efficacy assessments are being conducted as planned in the protocol, including following patients, to the extent possible, until death to enable an assessment of overall survival.”Read the language, here. That last part about collecting data “to the extent possible, until death...” meaning, they don’t expect to reach median OS even by the end of the primary analysis. And they will continue to collect that data to determine OS beyond the trial.And, “The IMbark protocol is being amended to establish an extension phase of the trial to enable patients remaining in the treatment phase to continue to receive imetelstat treatment per investigator discretion.”In other words, again, they don’t expect to reach median OS by the primary analysis, and those benefitting from treatment will actually continue to receive Imetelstat even though enrollment is closed, and even though the trial has officially ended.The fact that enrollment has closed so early says something very stark about OS. They were supposed to enroll some 200 pts, but at somewhere over 100 pts, they already have a clear OS signal. It must be very significant. Here’s the reality, they’re basically saying a continuation decision will prominently feature OS, which in Jan hadn’t been reached at median 19 months.I hope the impact of this is as clear as day. Let me put a point on it. They haven’t reached median OS, and yet they’re already expecting to close the trial by end of 2Q. With what must be stunning OS, sounds like they want to close the P2 and move on quickly to a P3.Everyone who is R/R to Rux will be paying attention to this wonderful development.",
We pretty much know here the gist of Monday don't ya think ? I think Monday will do (should do) alot now to educate the market and we may see a rush to buy shares (hard to know based on Monday's performance). We may just get ptca's upgrades if the right analysts show up and our chances are much higher now with all the recent pps action. The time schedule has been compressed as well to around 6 months or less for the reckoning.,
great news,
"Remember, if nothing else to know here, BOTH CTs are continuing. That's great news !IMBARK protocol was amended to allow current patients to continue being treated which makes sense if they are gaining benefit and still assesing OS. Seems at the current rate of deaths, median OS is seen around 24 months + predicted. To put it in perspective, what if we heard that based upon the internal review, they are discontinuing IMBARK. Update on Monday. NOOOO we didn't hear that, just the oppposite. I expect JS to still do his little dance with us on Monday  but hopefully continue his slightly upbeat posturing. Let's hope we get some decent analysts on Monday (the stock rise surely must have their attention now), and if Dr. Killjoy doesn't turn on us, we can see this fly through 4.00 ""possibly"".

We have been given a gift in the 8K ( I didn't expect this much data so early before Monday so I was wrong about that). Say hello to our little friend GERON.",
"A few notes from scanning the 10Q:1) This seems like no news is good news: ""In October 2017, Janssen submitted to the FDA data from the aforementioned internal reviews, as well as additional efficacy and safety data, including information about deaths and overall survival in IMbark, in response to an FDA information request regarding the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in relapsed or refractory MF and justification for continued treatment of patients enrolled in the trial. Since that submission, the FDA has not requested any additional information regarding IMbark, nor has the FDA requested any changes to the trial. ""2)  Continuation Decision Timing: ""Following completion of the IMbark protocol-specified primary analysis, Janssen must notify us of its Continuation Decision. We expect the protocol-specified primary analysis for IMbark to begin by the end of the second quarter of 2018. As such, we expect the Continuation Decision to occur by the end of the third quarter of 2018. Janssen could discontinue the imetelstat program and terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time, such as before the start of the IMbark primary analysis, and for any reason, irrespective of whether there is data from IMbark suggesting an adequate improvement in survival in relapsed or refractory MF or whether there is data from IMerge to support the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in lower risk MDS. In this regard, we believe that without an adequate improvement in survival in relapsed or refractory MF, with the determination of adequacy to be assessed by Janssen in its sole discretion, Janssen would decide to discontinue the imetelstat program and terminate the Collaboration Agreement.""",
"At least the second part of the MDS Phase 2 has finished enrolling: ""The first patient in the expanded Part 1 was dosed in November 2017 and enrollment was completed in February 2018.""",
"At this point, does anyone see Jansen pulling out of the agreement? I really don’t see it based on the progress made so far, so why not decide that now already? Really puzzling..",
"I know a good many people following the board are primarily concerned with what the shares are going to do in the very near term.  I've been in Geron since August of 1998, and at the moment based on today's release I confess I have zero opinion about the time frame between now and the continuation decision which is expected by the end of Q3.  I'll have been a Geron shareholder for 20 years by then, outside of Apple my longest held position.What I do have an opinion on is that Janssen is highly likely to maintain its rights in Imetelstat.  My reasons are as follows:1.  The MDS trial is now targeted to a patient population group that is highly likely to respond favorably to Imetelstat.  By the time IMbark is ready to readout, I believe the results Janssen will be seeing from this study will compel a positive Continuation Decision on their own.2.  The survival numbers from IMbark are very promising in total.  However, I will be very surprised if Janssen isn't seeing that some subgroups are responding at much higher rates, and with far deeper responses, than others.  This was clear from the Mayo results, and I believe is certain to be clear here too.  Within the very promising overall numbers, I anticipate that the responses from some subgroups will at a minimum compel continuation of Imetelstat for those populations.  3.  Janssen's recent affirmations of Imetelstat as one of its most promising candidates in its pipeline.I don't have an opinion as to the short term price action, but I do think what we know of the current trial results, combined with what we know happened in the Mayo Clinic trial, combined with Janssen's recent comments, make a very strong case that Janssen's continuation decision will be a positive one for Imetelstat, for patients, and thus for shareholders too.AX",
Whose selling after hours? Great news and we survive and march towards our destination!!,
Trying to buy another 5k shares after hours myself.  Looks some are getting filled at $3.26 so not bad considering.,
"Just started following this one, someone give me the nutshell version, is this statement bad news ? With a median follow up of approximately 19 months, the median overall survival has not been reached in either dosing arm.""",
Geez there’s a lot of after hour trades happening,
"MDS:  Pleased they already completed enrollment.MF:  Median OS not reached in either dosing arm.  But sounds like they anticipate the primary analysis at the end of the second quarter.  Ideally, would have been nice if this didn't occur until the end of the third quarter based on the following from the 7/31/17 PR:  ""The Joint Steering Committee has agreed that the timing of the protocol-specified primary analysis for IMbark will begin upon the earlier of either a pre-specified number of deaths occurring in the trial or the end of the third quarter of 2018.""",
"Jay, if I am reading the PR correctly that is 19 months as of January.  So I think we can add a couple months to that and still going.  All good.  Its pretty clear that the continuation decision is a done deal but I am sure J and Jan wants to wait as long as they can to be sure.  bp",
"I also think it is huge that the Internal Review will come at end of 2nd quarter and we will have continuation decision by September 30th, my birthday. This is at least three months earlier than they previously said and suggests to me that things are going very very well, thank you.",
"In today’s release:""With a median follow up of approximately 19 months, the median overall survival has not been reached in either dosing arm.”This is huge, folks! This is what we had dreamed and hoped they would tell us. So we do not have to wait until April 1st for the OS update. We are at 19months OS and continuing onwards!",
Obviously Scarlett will be elaborating more on Monday so I think this is more than we expected. This will be a nice relaxing weekend not having to ponder worse case scenarios for 56 hours lol,
"Clinical Development. Based on the preliminary data from the 13-patient subset, Janssen expanded Part 1 of IMerge to enroll approximately 20 additional patients who were naïve to lenalidomide and HMA treatment and non-del(5q) to increase the experience and confirm the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in this refined target patient population. The first patient in the expanded Part 1 was dosed in November 2017 and enrollment was completed in February 2018.So enrollment in the expanded MDS study has been completed.",
Sweet.  The best.,
"Overall very good news. I didn’t expect those nuggets, very pleased",
"I think you misread that Rodolfo. The primary analysis will BEGIN by the end of second quarter, not end.",
What is reason for moving up timeline?,

"With the rate of deaths they expect to complete the primary analysis by end of 2Q 2018, that probably means they might soon reach median OS between now and then.",
Non material report.  Looking to me like Monday will be also immaterial.,
"10Q filing out, so what's new?  OS not yet reached.http://bit.ly/2GzaaCH",
"Clinical Development. Janssen completed a third internal data review of IMbark in March 2018, based on a January 2018 data cut, to enable a protocol amendment to allow the long-term treatment and follow up of patients, including for survival, and the Collaboration’s Joint Steering Committee (JSC) made the following observations and implemented the following actions:The safety profile was consistent with prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies, and no new safety signals were identified.Outcome measures for efficacy, including spleen volume responses and reductions in Total Symptom Score remain consistent with the prior data reviews.With a median follow up of approximately 19 months, the median overall survival has not been reached in either dosing arm.The trial is officially being closed to new patient enrollment. More than 100 patients have been enrolled in IMbark to date, which is expected to be adequate to assess overall survival. Patients who remain in the treatment phase may continue to receive imetelstat, and until the primary analysis, all safety and efficacy assessments are being conducted as planned in the protocol, including following patients, to the extent possible, until death to enable an assessment of overall survival.Based on the rate of deaths occurring in the trial, the protocol-specified primary analysis, which includes an assessment of overall survival, will begin by the end of the second quarter of 2018.  Upon the protocol-specified primary analysis, the main trial will be completed. The IMbark protocol is being amended to establish an extension phase of the trial to enable patients remaining in the treatment phase to continue to receive imetelstat treatment per investigator discretion. During the extension phase, standard data collection will primarily consist of safety information.",
"“With the preliminary data from IMerge presented at ASH, we now have clinical data in three blood cancers, ET, MF and MDS, where imetelstat exhibits potential disease modifying activity by inhibiting the progenitor cells of the malignant clones that drive the underlying diseases,” said John A. Scarlett, M.D., Geron’s President and Chief Executive Officer.",
"Basically, by September 30 J&J will announce it's decision to continue or not.",

(This is NOT some back-handed way for us to somehow suggest that median OS has now been reached.)  We have not provided the number of death events to date or the number would trigger the primary analysis for the trial (in reference to slide 19), but I can tell you that the next internal interim data review for IMbark will be conducted in Q1 (as also stated in the presentation) and that is when the next update could be expected.I hope that helps.Kind regards,Anna",

only company to possibly buy Geron is J&J,
"This statement from George strikes me as a little odd:“On the flip side, I've long thought that Geron and J&J essentially have a buyout deal in place in the event that imetelstat works as advertised. Geron, for instance, can't entertain an outside party for imetelstat's U.S. rights if J&J remains in the picture. In other words, Geron gave up its ability to create leverage in a buyout scenario if imetelstat hits the mark.”https://yhoo.it/2DwciYxThe only way GERN could give up its leverage is if it agreed to a specific buyout price under a contract that’s legally binding. I don’t see GERN doing that. In fact, I don’t see any small biotech doing that so far in advance of the clinical trials and the results from the same. In addition, this pre-arranged price certainly strikes me as a material fact subject to disclosure. What biotech company would wish to disclose years in advance what the buyout price is? Such an agreement may also open GERN to a shareholders lawsuit claiming a breach of its fiduciary duty.I suppose GERN could have granted JNJ a right of first refusal but even that is not clear to me.Finally it’s my impression that GERN is acting like a company that wishes to remain a stand-alone entity. I’m referring to renting the additional office space and the numerous statements of JS concerning some sort of deal with a third party. I am also referring to the general attitude of JS during the last two conference calls.I suppose, however, if an acquiring company lays down enough money GERN may agree to a buyout. I do not believe, however, that it will be bought on the cheap. JS by this time has a pretty good idea of what he has and what he has may be worth a lot of money. - Sargasso",

"Thanks Hoosier, really appreciate your ability to explain things in laymen's terms. Regarding J&J buying Geron, is there any other asset other than Imetelstat; ie. patents not covered by the license agreement?",
"I believe George Budwell is incorrect in two ways:1)  Any pre-negotiated buyout agreement between JNJ and Geron would be a VERY MATERIAL event to Geron, and they would need to publicly disclose such a pre-arrangement.   I see no evidence of such an arrangement (i.e. contingent acquisition terms) within the Collaboration Agreement.   Furthermore, it would've been to Geron's advantage to disclose such a contingent buyout in support of their shareholders (via stock price appreciation).   Thus, in summary, I strongly disagree that Geron has pre-negotiated an acquisition price with JNJ.2) The collaboration agreement allows for Geron to be acquired by a third party.   Thus, the assumption and/or statement that JNJ has contractual right to first dibs on acquiring Geron is factually incorrect.   Via the collaboration agreement, JNJ secured an exclusive license to Imetelstat and 100% of future booking rights in exchange for milestone & royalty payments on future net sales.I've stayed away from the acquisition topic to avoid further & unnecessary speculation.  However, I'll dip my toe in the water since George has made a public error on the wrong side (my opinion).   With regard to Geron being acquired, I see four primary paths as outlined below.1)  JNJ acquisition of Geron.   JNJ has no (ZERO) reason to acquire Geron from a revenue growth perspective as they've already secured 100% of future booking rights.   Thus, acquiring Geron would do absolutely nothing to further boost JNJ's revenue growth.   The only reason JNJ would acquire Geron is to aid their future Earnings (EPS) growth.   This would be accomplished by avoiding (saving) further milestone payments and future royalty payments.   For every $1B in sales, JNJ will have to pay Geron close to $200M assuming Geron opts-in following a positive continuation decision.   One can estimate what JNJ might be willing to spend to acquire Geron by estimating future Imetelstat sales (until patent / regulatory expiration), multiplying total future sales by a net sales royalty of ~17.5%, and discounting that value back to today's dollars.   2) AbbVie acquisition of Geron.   If AbbVie sees significant potential in the Imetelstat/Venetoclax, it might be wise for them to take Geron's place at the Steering Committee meetings with JNJ, and put themselves in position to receive any milestones & royalty payments due from JNJ.  Strategically, by taking Geron's seat at the Steering Committee table, AbbVie could help ensure the Imet/Ventoclax combo gets a fair opportunity to compete in the markets (MM, etc) where JNJ's products have (or will) establish a dominant position.   Otherwise, as a outsider with no patent rights, AbbVie is at JNJ's mercy on when/where/how JNJ wishes to utilize the Imetelstat/Venetoclax combo.3) Celgene acquisition of Geron.   Celgene seems intent on capturing a portion of the MF market based on their recent acquisition of Fedratinib.   Fedratinib is a JAK inhibitor that appears to be comparable to Ruxolitinib with some demonstrated ability to restore spleen responses in patients who have failed Ruxolitinib.   However, according to the JAKARTA-1 data, Fedratinib patients are likely to lose their responses (similar to Ruxolitinib) and there's no indication of marrow clearing within the subset of patients responsding to Fedratinib.   Thus, Imetelstat's opportunity to benefit MF patients with an unmet need appears to be intact even if Fedratinib gains FDA approval.  By acquiring Geron, Celgene would control two promising MF drugs, and be entitled to further milestone payments & net sales royalties from JNJ should Imetelstat gain any further approvals (MDS, AML, Venetoclax Combo, etc).4) Geron could go it alone.  Geron will be due royalties on the use of a telomerase inhibitor as a treatment for MF and MDS until 2033 (minimum), and Geron will be due further royalties on any Imetelstat/Venetoclax combo sales until 2036 (minimum).   Thus, Geron could be in a position to receive significant royalties for a significant period of time....especially if the imetelstat/venetoclax combination proves useful in lymphoma.   As a result, Geron’s share price could realize significant EPS-based appreciation should they simply choose to collect royalties while operating with minimal staffing & expenses.   This is longer-term option, but it may represent the largest share price appreciation potential of all the options.",

"Sage....May I change the $3 billion buyout number to $3 billion potential in revenues. That equates to approximately $600+ million in profit for Geron, or maybe $3.50-$3.80 EPS.At that kind of EPS Geron could be a $35 stock some day so when I hear all this buyout talk I get a little frustrated. There are no guarantees in life, or in biotech, but don't some of you think the long-term growth horizon portends possible advancing patents, trials, and new indications?Geron could turn into a long-term growth stock and we keep talking about a short-term fix, a buyout?And Jacosa........telemorase (not telo) is right! You were right to buy and make a ton of money in Incyte. Incyte has a tremendous amount of sales to lose if Imetelstat takes it away. Think about getting on board with Geron and doing it all again. It doesn't have to be all-or-none. Jakafi is yesterday's technology. Maybe there's use there for some time but if the front line (small) Mayo numbers are to be believed, there is risk associated with Jakafi. You were right to hold Incyte and you have options at this point.One thing is for certain Jacosa, you or we cannot know for sure what the future will bring. It would be easier for Geron to be a success at this point then Incyte, no matter how much they diversify. So much of their present is tied to Jakafi it may very well be several years before any diversification will help them.You may be one of the few to have your cake and eat it too. We should all be so lucky.",

I just wonder if the price rise has any effect on what, and how, Scarlett speaks?I do agree with CKTC that the Venetoclax/Imetelstat patent filing changes the game enormously.

"Mostly just doing my usual corrections.There is NO data on ""in-the-wild"" persistence of Jaka[fv]i use.  In the Comfort pooled summary, about half of the patients still alive and followed after 5 years were still taking the drug.  Persistence in PV (a much less serious disease, so drug discontinuation has a lower barrier) is clearly longer than 2 years (again, no specific data, but that's a lower bound from combining adoption rate (again, an estimate) with total usage (a less-vague estimate).It is invalid to estimate median survival for MF patients treated first-line with imetelstat by adding the median survival of patients receiving it after Jakafi to median survival on Jakafi (if that's what you did; I think it is).  A key piece of missing information is the fraction of patients who meet enrollment criteria for IMBark after discontinuation of Jaka[fv]i treatment.  The flip side of the infamous ""novel withdrawal syndrome"" case is that Jakafi may still be doing a lot to control MF even as the disease is progressing.  In that situation, ECOG performance is expected to drop to worse than 2 very quickly.It is possible that the modes of action of imetelstat and Jaka[fv]i are completely independent of each other [That would be expected if imetelstat works primarily by inhibition of telomerase activity or histone methylation] [but not likely--in the Mayo series, only patients with always-on-mutated JAK-2 responded to imetelstat].  Should that be the case, though, the median survival in IMBark [patients with reasonably acceptable performance after discontinuation of the first drug] would be a decent estimate of the median survival for first-line imetelstat--the highest supportable estimate right now would be 30 months (vs 60 months measured directly for Jaka[fv]i).. (The ongoing harm you sometimes claim from Jakafi treatment is unknown to FDA)So if you're going to take over all cancer treatment, talk more about #1 Avastin and less about something in the #15-20 range.",

"What happens if nothing of any interest is revealed either Friday or Monday?  How much can we expect the stock to pull back based on unmet anticipation?  Even no mention of overall survival being met yet, while good news for those of us in the know, may not be enough to maintain the gains achieved in this recent run up.From a trade point of view I see this as an interesting opportunity.  Selling on Friday before the close could lock in value.  Then either one of two things happen; A) There is good news and you miss out on some upward movement but now the investing thesis is much safer because of the news and you buy back in at a higher price but with more security or B) There is a drop in the price because of either no news or even the announcement of some delay.  If that is the case and the stock drops back into the mid-$2 range then we have the potential to increase our position by as much as 30% based on the profits we lock in on Friday.The absolute 'worst' thing that could happen under these circumstances is that the stock doubles on Monday and you end up buying in with only half the position you had but complete certainty where there was none before.  So the proposition is that your position drops by 50% or increases by perhaps 30%.  If you believe that management has been sandbagging then you want to be invested fully on Monday morning.  If you think this run up is based on investor expectations and not anything telegraphed by the company, then it might be a good time to actively trade some of your position.FWIW, I'm talking about those of us who keep a portion of our GERN position for playing with.  My core position is not for trading.",
"First IVD Product Sale in Switzerland13-Mar-2018Sienna is pleased to announce the first sale of the company’s hTERT test in Switzerland through its distribution partner, Biosystems Switzerland AG. Following the signing of Biosystems Switzerland as the exclusive distributor for Switzerland of Sienna’s novel IVD test, the first order by a Swiss laboratory has been delivered. This follows the training of Biosystems key personnel by Sienna in late 2017, and evaluation and clinical validation by the customer.Biosystems Switzerland CEO, Urs Brunner said: “Interest in the hTERT test has been very encouraging. Although urine cytology is non-invasive it has significant limitations in terms of sensitivity, particularly when it comes to low-grade or early-stage bladder cancer. Having a biomarker test that can provide additional clinically significant information for the diagnosing physician, while using the same urine sample collected for cytology, adds real value to the diagnostic process, and pathologists appreciate this.”Sienna is encouraged by the interest shown in the hTERT test in Switzerland: “The team at Biosystems Switzerland has done a great job of generating a pipeline of interested laboratories, several of which are well advanced in evaluating the test for clinical use. This is a key milestone in our ongoing geographical expansion strategy,” said Minesh Lalla, Business Development Manager, Sienna Cancer Diagnostics.",

After reading a comment on Yahoo is see a investor has had fights with his wife about how many shares he has of GERN. It reminded me of something my wife said a year ago. She told me I was the smartest man she knows. I have asked myself once in a while if she knows what she is talking about! With 2 million shares plus we all will find out soon. If you are reading this you likely asked the same question. It may not be Monday but in the next year we will know.

"From an article about Scott Kelly's DNA changing in space: ""Mason's team also saw changes in the length of Scott's telomeres, caps at the end of chromosomes that are considered a marker of biological aging. First, there was a significant increase in average length while he was in space, and then there was a decrease in length within about 48 hours of his landing on Earth that stabilized to nearly preflight levels. Scientists believe that these telomere changes, along with the DNA damage and DNA repair measured in Scott's cells, were caused by both radiation and calorie restrictions.""http://bit.ly/2tNHMKm",

"Boris,Nice presentation. My concern is the dip in 2017 sales, likely from consolidation. Revenue volatility doesn't concern me, but its a very competitive industry and I wonder if they can actually achieve the growth you're forecasting. Also, the cash conversion cycle is long.The stock is definitely cheap at 10x EBIT and on a P/E net cash basis, but they likely need to see better growth and higher returns on capital to unlock the value you're suggesting in my opinion. I do get the story though, a smart management team driving, at minimum, an inflection in organic sales and maybe an acquisition. The former interests me more than the latter. At least with the capital raise out of the way and assuming mgmt acts *carefully*, downside is likely minimal. The sell side targets look fair, coming in at $17-18.",Lakeland Industries Is A Bargain At <10x EV/EBIT

NFLX dropping to $300 isn't a crazy prediction as its more than possible if the market drops a bit .

Noise folks BUT the next earnings report in mid April could go either way.  It may pull back simply because the expectations will be set very high.  With that said I would add on any pull back but leading up to the next earnings I think it will continue to keep going up so hang on for the ride.,

"Good report, good model. Not a blindly bullish crypto nut however, there are a lot of nuances not explained in this report. It would take a report that's even longer to explain the nuances which I agree sounds dicey. HIVE is a highly risky endeavor, and one has to believe that the price of crypto skyrockets in the yrs to come to believe in HIVE. For HIVE to skyrocket the following needs to happen (plain and simple):- ETH/Crypto continues rising steadily (obviously)- HIVE hoards inventories and sells at much higher prices in futureHIVE is essentially a long (out of the money) call option on crypto. One would probably conclude that if you are a crypto believer, you should just buy the coins however, there is meaningful demand for ppl to gain exposure within their brokerage accounts without the custody concerns of holding the coins (and for tax purposes).A comparison to gold miners is a stretch, imo. Historically, commodities tend to revert back to a price that is reflective of the costs to mine/extract them; which (inflation adjusted) remains relatively static over time. What's different about crypto mining, is that as the mining/hashrate/diffic... grows, so too does the cost to mine. That being the case, prices of crypto that are much higher than when they were mined, can more reasonably be sustained over the long term, unlike most commodities. This is the key point/difference.  So for HIVE to make a lot of money, crypto needs to keep rising, and HIVE needs to hoard inventory and sell at significantly higher prices than when the coins were mined. This model can be brutal at times and extremely profitable at others. Case in point, the largest Bitcoin miner in the world (BITMAIN - a private co), made more money in 2017 than NVDA, the darling of the Nasdaq. Because BITMAIN mined coins at low margins for yrs, hoarded them, and sold at significantly higher prices. Large crypto currencies cannot realistically expect to be viable starting off w/ a PoS consensus algorithm as they will be too centralized (PoS can be a safeguard against mining centralization however, only once coins are widely distributed). If a crypto starts off w/ PoS, that is a hugely centralized network. As ETH pivots to PoS slowly over a long period of time, the price of ETH may skyrocket as supply will become more visible and begin to taper. Additionally, if HIVE is sitting on a mountain of ETH when this happens, their steak can be quite profitable (and stable) should they decide to continue holding inventory if price keeps rising, or they can sell at what may be very high prices. BTC and other cryptos trying to be the digital gold, will have to use a PoW model and miners will need to be mining PoW cryptos for a long time. Bitcoin can theoretically switch to PoS when (and only when) the 21 millionth coin is mined. Again, I am not a crypto nut however, this analysis misses a lot of key nuances specific to crypto mining, and comparing it to gold mining isn't very meaningful (for many more reasons than I have cited above). HIVE is hugely risky and buying crypto is probably a better bet (imo) however, for those that want exposure to crypto in their brokerage account w/out the custody concerns and believe much higher prices are on the horizon; this isn't a bad way to participate. If the author of this article would ever like to debate this I would be hugely interested.",
"Block chain doesn't depend on crypto to exist.Cryptosporidium are FIAT $$ too but the 'say so comes people with no real authority Slow & expensive transactions and with it taking wild swings up & down who wants to take it or use it?

Here's another article related to both Blockchain and ETH (and why a company like HIVE is so much a part of the foundational infrastructure of IoE). None of the analysts (including CFA's like Ed) have been able to understand that this is all one of the areas that P0S will lead towards (and although P0S is anywhere up to 2 years down the road this is a perfect example of an opportunity for HIVE).,

"""Cryptocurrency miner like Hive can also be compared to producing gold miners for valuation purposes.""Perhaps this is true in the case of granddad/grandkids mining operation but it is definitely wrong in the case of Hive, Hut, Dash and the other large scale miners/master node operators.  Hut/Hive/Dash all have strategies of hording the coins they've mined. I don't know of a single gold miner that hordes gold produced, only selling what is required to maintain operations (looking at retained earnings. It seems most in recent days need to sell every once mined to stay in business. Other major differences of course is available ""oz"". With high enough gold prices, a lot of North America's copper/gold deposits become economical and available reserves and resources jump hugely. Not the case for cryptominers - BTC, ETH, DASH, etc. coins all have fixed cap counts.Its the NPV of future coin production (in coin being mined) that provides a reasonable basis for valuing Hive, Hut and Dash. My evolving models suggest that Hive and Dash are correctly valued today based on mining futures (I discount Hive BTC mining until they report actual coin production numbers). Similarly its hard to say if Hut is correctly valued since there is very limited data to date - I like actual production numbers and coins horded counts rather than hand waving around MW of power. Data improve in coming quarters.Thx for a great and timely article.",
"OK…I’ll try to keep it simple…too many things to comment on … I believe you are fundamentally incorrect and clearly don’t see HIVE, Blockchain, or the opportunities offered the way I do...However, how great to comment on so many different stocks in one hit piece...clearly you pick up on bits and pieces that help you...onward....1. You finally are able to admit HIVE truly doesn't fit the pseudo-cryptocurrency label you shouted at readers in your first missive, yet as of this date, and this writing, you still fail to point out that as a company, HIVE has really only been in existence since Sept. 17th, 2017 - and that this last quarter makes it truly the 1st quarter that its been operating - that is unless you wish to misrepresent the 12 days in Sept. as a full quarter. HIVE has only shown operational efficiencies in their last report but hey, you have to paint the truth somehow to support your short.2. Your explanation as to how HIVE as a miner projects their revenues, found in the paragraph starting with ""Cryptocurrency miners such as Hive and MGT project their revenue based on these main factors” with the comment ""larger miners like Genesis/Hive … have higher hash rate speeds, but lead to higher electricity costs”, fails to address and account for the strategy created by HIVE’s management (with GENESIS’ participation) regarding energy and their costs (by the way, the term computational power covers hashrates, GPU’s,rigs, electricity).3. When you state “while these revenue projections can be met or even exceeded, the most likely scenario is that these figures are too optimistic” I’d like to point out that you were wrong the last time you wrote here on SA…and we’ll see what happens with year end. What I can tell you is that HIVE is about to announce that they’re on schedule/possibly ahead of with their buildout.... and you do realize that pricing is pretty much manipulated entirely by WS (and its global brethren) these days, right?4. You comment that the ""revenue projections based on ETH or BTC future prices must be taken with a grain of salt”. This is kind of accurate; but then again, you must be looking into your Quan/Con Magic 8-Ball? Last time I checked there is a litany of geo-political uncertainty that could lead to a market meltdown ... and you also don’t mention that WS is primarily the culprit to hold accountable for the price fluctuations - Arb, Options, GREED. Moreover, that’s why a “hoard” for crypto is interesting (potatoe, pohtahtoe). See the last part of 3 for amplification.5. Your comments related to ""mining difficulty” show something….that you don’t know that you don’t know… or do you know that you don’t know? Because you post 2 very useful sites that definitely understand what they’re talking but fail to correlate the data that they show to actual earnings or projections - in fact you fail to correlate any of the data to HIVE. Moreover, at a very basic level (and what I find interesting), you demonstrate the inability to understand that Casper (P0S) addresses functionality of the network as well as fail to identify the attendant earning opportunities - and that’s why you’re not getting what’s going on with HIVE. For me, you talk about HIVE like you’re only used to the Missionary position….and while being/laying on your back may work for you, it really isn’t that exciting and misses a whole lot of everything else…and again, you fail to mention that the fluctuations in pricing for crypto has more to do with WS creating and trading on volatility rather than the underlying technology - and in doing so, fail to address core possibilities in an economy of function.So, for all of us here, please explain how the ETH difficulty chart and graph correlates to HIVE’s objectives and please also explain their correlation and importance related to Casper (or the effect Casper will have and what the data will then read) and HIVE’s earning potential with the possible switch to P0S? Please explain how you could fail to discuss forging in this piece; is that because you don’t understand? Wait, that’s one of the reasons why you needed to have me lay it out for you. It is. That’s why you asked me and that's why you couldn't write about it.6. Regarding the “difficulty bomb”…. oooh…. sooo scary…..but It all comes down to this simple point - either ethereum will persuade the majority of its users to upgrade to the new proof-of-stake-powered blockchain or ethereum will run the risk of creating another blockchain.There will be bumps on the road either way. BTW, that’s still a few years away.7. ... and to discuss Hut 8 which just started trading on March 6th…seriously, How about a big WTF? I clearly can see that you use bits and pieces of information to patch together your information. Newsflash Flash, they have not yet acquired 60 megawatts and I can tell you about their datacenter(s)…8. For P0W and P0S, try this: http://bit.ly/2FOJiO1. 9. Now for the b*tch slap you've got coming.... get to the section on Capital Lock up Costs. Since you're challenged it's put simply: In a Proof-of-Stake system, the coin holders get paid transaction fees for validating transactions. Therefore, Proof-of-Stake creates a clear and unambiguous economic incentive to hold coins for the long term. I did not stutter.10. You don’t have any revenue models to address a P0S system.I'm sure you'll find a talking point to counter this absent item.11. Furthermore, the future price of ETH (in a P0S system) can and will be analyzed based on the expected future cash flows, which are generated in the form of network transaction fees. I mean think about it, essentially, a P0S blockchain can be thought of as a decentralized Visa/Mastercard with all the additional distributed ledger functionality supported by the specific implementations... and that's important, because a Proof-of-Stake coin value can be supported by traditional value arbitrage investing. 12.  The bottom line for P0S is if Casper is a successful P0S upgrade, Ethereum and other competing POS chains (in the long run) become stores of value and as payment networks/ledgers.13. Why is IBM of the belief there’s at least $3T of opportunity in the near future with Blockchain? Why has AMEX now developed their own blockchain?14. The best comment you made in your entire piece was ""Investors would be getting a lot more value if Genesis and Hive were one entity”. That would be called one hell of an opportunity wouldn’t it. I guess that could make HIVE a takeover target. So maybe there’s a bit more of a reason why Fidelity is involved. Who would want to have a large miner as a validator/ forger for transactions? What would that kind of roll up cost…let’s say for an Insurance Company? Hmm, let’s see….15. Unfortunately,  in an effort to try and simplify my writing, most everything else you’ve based your commentary related to the ""financial assumptions made by Hive are 1) not predictable in terms of ETH and BTC pricing, and 2) not sustainable in terms of mining difficulty and costs” etc. are boring and incorrect because you just don’t understand the importance of what’s occurring in Blockchain and HIVE and why its positioned the way it is - and being incorrect at a foundational level makes everything else askew. Disclosure: I am long HIVE.",

"""One reason may be that Longfin has maintained the highest annual borrow rate (105% to 130%) during the last two months, which is a clear sign that lenders are very nervous about this stock.""@author, I get the impression that extremely high borrow rate is more due to the demand to borrow LFIN stock.  I'm sure brokers set that rate to try to pull in the maximum amount from short sellers.  I don't know how many shares are lent directly by the owners and how many are lent out by the brokers but I suspect it's skewed toward the brokers who loan out their clients' shares, either because their clients have a margin balance or through a direct agreement.Unfortunately, everyone already knows that Longfin's stock is grossly overvalued so the borrow rates and the option prices reflect that.  I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that Longfin's $3B market cap is vapor.  Short sellers who think they have a lock on the stock eventually dropping are almost certainly correct, but they might go broke being short in the interim.  There may only be about 1.5M shares in Longfin's float and that makes the stock extremely volatile which can also hurt short sellers.",

Vlad - Thanks for another strong and interesting contribution.  I like that you gave some more flavor on the demand side and I know that information is not always readily available or clear.  Based on your 3 articles to date I would categorize the regions as follows:Norwegian North Sea  -   supply tight -  highly attractive - bullish day ratesGulf Of Mexico (GOM)  - overs supplied -  less attractive - bearish day ratesSub Saharan Africa   -  balanced supply - potentially attractive - not bull or bear hereCould you comment on relative market size of each of these Regions?  My sense is that the ranking on volume (not $) is:   but this is not very precise GOM #1NNS #2SSA #3Thanks again - really enjoying this series and the overall picture being painted.    GLTA,

"Jasper Explorer is a real oldtimer, a pelican class design drillship originally built in 1973 and named ""Havdrill"" at that time. The rig has had many owners and as many names in the past decades (Canmar Explorer, Explorer I, Northern Explorer, Neptune Explorer).It's of the same design as Paragon Offshore's DPDS2 drillship. That said, the rig has been upgraded in 2010. It is currently cold-stacked and I don't expect it to work again. Jasper Offshore was already bankrupt in 2014 and the rig was handed over to the bondholders at that time.The company owned a second rig, ""Jasper Cosmopolitan"", a semi-sub converted to an accomodation unit but I couldn't find any information about its current status.http://bit.ly/2DsHmbE",How Tight Is Sub-Saharan Africa?
"Most of the recent stock gains didn't come because of Zejula sales in the recent quarter. In fact, the stock went down after the earnings call. All of the recent stock gains came after hefty insider buying.",
I agree with the Author that a takeout if 6 billion is a win/win for both he acquired and the buyer. That's the sweet spot but the TSRO has to agree to the sale. I have to think there are buyers at that price currently.,
"sounds all good but what about toxicity concerns of Zejula? also I believe the stock is only going up upon successfully completed pipeline projects, Zejula sales/growth seems prices in",
"It seems there is dilution risk given the slow ramp up in Zejula sales and the rate of spend.  They will want to keep plenty of cash on hand rather than let reserves dwindle - expect to always keep enough cash on hand to fund the company for 12 months. Would be good to see revenue estimates from some other analysts - rather than just take the optimistic guidance from Tesaro.  I think it is significant that Merck chose to partner with AZN with Lynparza rather than Tesaro, even though Zejula originated from the Merck labs. And we also have the Clovis PARP inhibitor as further competition. Always the unknown of the value of pipeline.","Tesaro's Long-Term Sales Guidance For Zejula Achievable, Shares Look Undervalued"
"Yep, always a good sign to see someone come out of pocket with after tax cash like we do.  It might be constructive to talk with her but I have spoken to the old CEO and liked him very much.  He owns stock too, but that didn't help the business turn around.  I was just curious if you had an operational or other thesis on what actually changes to fix the business so it can consistently make money.  It sounds like you do not but you have faith in the new CEO and know the equity is very cheap if they can manage to turn it around and i agree with you on that.  I'm just struggling to see what lever they need to pull to fix it and it seems they are too.",
"So what, the working capital has to stay in the business both operationally and from a fraudulent conveyance standpoint.  Where do you get any conviction that they can make the business profitable?  Losing $2.3mm a quarter just means you have 10 more quarters before they are forced to file and your equity is worthless.  I want to believe but it looks like they are doing more of the same and expecting a different answer, really hard to tell what is going to change the money losing path they have been on.  The old CEO was a great guy and doing all he could and  it just didn't matter.   What do you think will change?",
"What now?  If you owned the whole thing what would you be doing different?  You can't dividend cash because you have lease liabilities.  Throw it into bankruptcy or give it a few more quarters of blood letting and see if things change.  It is amazing the new CEO wants to review everything, I thought the old one was the activist guy and doing all the right things and she just needed to come in and follow his path.  I guess not.",

March data shows women's clothing had its best month in 2 years.   Easy comps for CBK too.   HQ building sold for a decent price.  EV close to zero.   Can CBK report a good quarter with high single digit SSS comps and a positive outlook next week?,
"Head office sale and leaseback done , as expected they just waited for the new CEO to join.  Decent price , seems to be low lease cost although we don’t know the exact amount on the lease rate.   Good to have another 13mn+ in cash and an EV below 10!",
"Why are revenues going to be lower in 2018 ?    Stores closures this year are quite small, in fact net closures I think might be close to zero from the conference call guidance.  SSS were +5 in q4 with positive trends like in q1 and q2 especially from easy comps.   Capex isn’t 7mn, management said it would be 3-4mn going forward as the IT investment is already complete.",
That was subjective (aka emotional). What am I missing than?,
"I wan't to love this company. This is so much to love. But I don't see a path to profitability. Assuming revenue stays the same over the next year (when we know it will likely decrease with store closures leading to decreased economies of scale and margins), even if operating margins are 4% and the firm hits is Capex reduction guidance of $7M, you're still at nearly break even free cash flow. Sorry for the run on sentence. Thanks for the write up. What am I missing?",
"The cash ""bleed"" has actually fallen a lot already - the full year results included a poor first half under the old CEO and clearing inventory at low prices.  And the last few years they've also been investing in IT which has inflated capex.   The capex outlook is stated as 3-4mn $ annually going forward, substantially below depreciation and recent years capex.   Q4 is always the seasonally weakest quarter and they generated over $5mn in free cash, although this was inflated by improved working capital which isn't sustainable.   If as they communicated on the conference call there are still big gains in gross margin to come, like they started to achieve in Q4 as old inventory has been cleared and mark downs much reduced, this would allow them to generate positive EBITDA again in 2018.  I think CCI's point is very well made - nothing is certain in investing, but a lot is about what price you pay for the situation and opportunity.  If CBK was trading at $2.5+ i wouldn't buy it, given the current situation.  But at $1 it's a completely different bet.    If the new CEO ends up being decent, and they monetize the building, and see positive SSS and GM improvement through 2018, this stock is very cheap at $1.   The 42 days to cover short interest would also help move things along if there is more positive news.   I expect we will only have to wait 3 months or so to find out what the new CEO's strategy will be, and for some news on the HQ building.",
"So, what makes you think CBK can be profitable again? I get it that the inventory is looking better, and the new CEO looks promising and the comps might be at a better place. For the share to rise, the company should really turn around. If the buyers return to the store due to the new/old design in CATO and its huge cash hoard, it makes sense.What's your take for this? Ok, they might sell their real estate for 15M and total cash will be at 38M which is roughly their mkt cap. BUT, without a real positive outlook and a bleed that stops, the share might not recover...",
I think the timing of the new CEO's arrival may explain why there might be a delay in some people's minds on the HQ building and follow-on cost cutting or store rationalisation at the recent Q4 results.  It would be strange for them not to wait for her to review and discuss these major strategic and financing topics with the Board before they make decisions and announce to investors.  3-4 months from her arrival date sounds realistic timing to me on all of this.,
"Thanks for this excellent work. I was adding to my CBK position today and this week. As a deep value investor, I’ve done okay with your investment comment. “You can make money buying when things go from bad to mediocre.”",
"Nice write up.    42 days to cover for shorts, if this starts to move on better news or a building disposal and it will be a bloodbath for shorts and most holders aren’t going to sell below 3 given their in price.   I’d also point out the big improvement in gross margin alongside the positive SSS number.  Management have clearly stated they are not focused just in SSS , they stopped discounting merchandise a lot through Black Friday and since, and recognize the need to get the gross margin back up and it was a big improvement in q4.  The CFO said this was just the start in margin and he was excited about the potential improvement on this for 2018.  They need it up another 300bp or more from here with positive SSS and you will see a major profit turnaround.  Cato is still printing negative SSS although I think the stock is interesting.  It is early days for both Cato and CBK turnaround efforts so need to be patient , and both stocks have plenty of cash.",
"The fourth quarter did not show a same store sales improvement versus third quarter if you use a 2 year stacked sss percentage.  I just see bleeding at this point.  The new CEO definately provides hope though.  I'll keep watching.  I like Cato better in this space.  Lot more cash, still profitable and they are going back to their old business model that worked well.",

"Thank you for this, clear simple and comprehensive.",
"Good job, already purchased some CBK after the third quarter conference call but things did not play out as expected. There was nothing really wrong with Q4 results but investors, clearly, expected more progress after the company already reported mid-single digit SSS increases for the month of October and saw the trends accelerating further into Q4 at the time of the Q3 earnings call at the end of November.Obviously, the acceleration didn't take hold given the 5.7% SSS increase reported for Q4 against a very easy comparison. Sold my position at a small loss in pre-market last week after digesting the press release.That said, I like your thesis but I would like to see more tangible evidence for a recovery in the business to re-enter the stock. Q1 will be quite interesting.",
"CCISorry, but too many negatives here:1) Inventory per store has increased to $893k from $801k in 2014, this could be a sign of strength  in some cases, but since net sales per sft ft dropped from $193 to $164, it is a very strong negative2) Cash per store has dropped from $965k in 2014 to only $498k. 3) One of their vendors supplies 27% of their merchandise and another about 10%. What happens if they no longer grant credit, but demand DVP or even worse pre-paid?4) 30% of their leases expire between now and Feb 2019. If they want to liquidate this could be a plus, but if they want to continue as a going concern, this is a negative.5) Very often a  ""buying interest"" of a building never closes. (I have been on both sides)I expect them to liquidate something like Bon-Ton Stores (BONTQ) is starting to doWYCO",

Neimans!,
"I have been saying since the day of the IPO this company can not survive. Saks,Newman’s, and 20 other companies all do the same thing. The problem with stitch is they are stuck with tons of returned inventory. At least saks, Neimans etc already owns the inventory , they send you stuff that’s on the floor. If it’s returned it goes back on the floor or maybe off fifth at the end of the season. SFIX has to order merchandise to fill the orders than stuck with the items in a warehouse when they are returned. They simply can not make money and walmart, lord and Taylor, Amazon all have their own online systems and will NEVER buy stitch fix . Zappos was BRILLIANT, shop bop is brilliant, but the problem is you need to be the FIRST, the BEST or the ONLY to ever succeed in retail and they are NONE of those.",

Bias about new ideas and and ventures beyond the norm seem so lost in the mall stores where to this day many limitations exist even with all the tech support engaging.

"Ms Harding, thx for your well thought research. You may, in the future, want to do write ups on companies that do not have such bitter anti bias. I have rarely seen hate for a company like I have this one. As a multi yr holder, every time this stock takes a dip, the howls surface about bubbles bursting. It’s one of those things where, hey I missed it, I continue to miss it, and gosh darn it, until it makes valuation sense, I will not buy! When people use pe as an end all to investing, one is 100% guaranteed to miss opportunities like this one. The enhancing of the hatred comes from Amazon now being everywhere. It serves as a near constant reminder of just how far off some investors were in sizing up this company. Trust me, if your mad in 2018, your gonna be inconsolable in 2028",
"As a stitch fix customer, when I receive my FIX, I immediately go to Amazon to see if the item is available.  1/3 of the time it is not.  1/3 of the time it is the same price.  1/3 of the time the price on Amazon is 50% less.While i like the the convenience and basically no charge (if you purchase 1 item) I don't believe this will last.

"700HK is a fascinating variation on ""too big to fail.""  If the CCP does anything to hose the Western owners of the Tencent VIE ADRs, it will destroy future confidence in would-be Western equity investors and debt investors, in Tencent and in the other Chinese tech companies.  Westerners have short attention spans (behold Equifax), but Asians have long perspectives, and, as most people do, they assume everyone else (us included) is like them.  Thus the CCP, of which Pony Ma is an official, and the Western Tencent investors' interests are aligned.  The CCP is not stupid enough to do anything to cut off Western funding of their tech industry or of the One Belt, One Road initiative generally, because they know that would cut off Western money, at least in the short-term and maybe the medium-ish term, and maybe longer.  And hosing Western investors would cut off continued deals with our US tech companies, run by naïve Millennials, which the CCP relies on to facilitate intellectual property ""sharing"" with US companies.  I hold TCEHY as way less than 1% of the total, as a potential multi-bagger, but definite source of fascination.  GLTA.",

Could you show how you calculate Beta? Thanks!,
"Excellent article and follow-up discussion. One thing that struck me was the similarity of the graphs. I was getting the feeling that these must be the same company. Or maybe that is how the market views them. This implies that there is a sad lack of due diligence in investing these days. Money is just being thrown at hi-tech because it is hi-tech.

"These companies do not move with the market, they move the market. That's why high beta. Causation is the other way around here. Here's what I'm saying, the very composition of SPX (the ""Market"") and the arithmetic of beta works such that the highest weighted stocks move the lowest weighted ones. So when you say that the market moves these companies, it's not exactly the case. What do you think, a move in AAPL (highest weighted in SPX) will move NWS (lowest weighted on SPX) or the other way around?...and from this follows my hypothesis. Overvalue has more probability to be found at the lower end of SPX than at the upper end. Of course, not that you cannot find stocks like AMZN, NFLX etc. which are overvalued despite being at the higher end of SPX. That's why the qualifier ""probability"".",

"Thank you for the article. Some observations of the behaviour of FANG led me down a similar path of thinking. As someone else mentioned, the difficulty here is that FANG make up a large part of NASDAQ so computing their beta vis-à-vis this index can result in a distorted view.  What I did instead was to compare the relationship in the returns of FANG against S&P or the DJII.  In addition I focused only on extreme up and down days (+/- 1.50%) because I was most concerned with the resilience of the stock during extreme events.  I observed that for some of these companies, when the market really went down, these stocks suffered more than others. At the same time, when the overall market goes up these same stocks didn't go up nearly as much. This relationship has changed over the past year.",

"I think what is truly scary is that everyone owns these stocks in individual portfolios and redundant ETF's or indices and that they have had a disproportionate impact on overall market returns, meaning they represent a large portion of total returns. If you look at the simple earnings multiples of these companies you get a different take; AMZN  257, MSFT 75, AAPL 18, FB 32, google 63. They are clearly some differences. Its also true that the more a company grows the harder it becomes for that company to maintain or  improve its EPS growth rate. In the end the PE ratio simply tells us that if we invest 1 $ today at current valuation say in AMZN if will take us 257 years to get that 1$ back assuming the company can maintain that rate of growth for the next 257 years. Now I know that AMZN has gone up a lot and might continue to do so simply because of fund flowing into the stock, or ETF's owning the stock, but the valuation at which the stock trades is indeed scary... Well at the high of the technology bubble I think Qualcomm at a 2000 PE so go figure,  on March 1st 2000 the stock traded at 74 USD...and 17 years later the stock trades at 59 and todays analyst average price target is 71.44 still below where it traded in March of 2000. At some point EPS much catch up with the stock price or the opposite will occur. I think the author is using a different metric to illustrate the idea.",
"But, but, but...it's different this time. Many of the current retailers in the FANG stocks have NEVER experienced a bear market. They will learn just as others have learned. Just another reason 9beta) that this market is way over bought and facing a ton of head winds in the next year or two.",
"A simpler way to manage your risk is to limit your position size. I own AMZN, GOOG, FB and AAPL. The only one that is over weighted is AAPL - for obvious reasons. Currently weighs in at about 18% of direct ownership of stocks. If we take into account indirect ownership through funds in 401k's that figure is probably closer to 25%. However, our initial investment probably is closer to a 4% figure, so we are playing with house money.We got into the other other 3 companies much later. Always thought they were over valued. But when we pulled the trigger, our position size was small (<2%).This method of mitigating your risk, IMHO, is much simpler to implement and much easier to understand.Just my two cents.",

I think you should short them all. Seems logical based on your study. Good luck.,
"I think the author needs to learn from his mistakes. The quickest way for him to learn is to start short positions on Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft.  He can then get back to us and let us know what he did wrong here. Here's historical perspective: 20 years ago, Amazon was going for about $2 per share and now it's going for a tiny bit more than that  (about $1,600 per share). So, guys, this may be the mistake of a lifetime but I think I will hold on to my ridiculously over-valued Amazon shares. One of the comments above points to the only thing that could stop the likes of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, and that would be excessive government intervention. The referee, if you will, would have to interject himself into the game and cheat on behalf of their competition. The French, for example, seem to want to sue these big American companies all the time for simply being too successful.",

"Very well written and informative, thanks.",
"The author gives off an initial impression that he's a really smart guy (and I'm sure he is). But he lost me with this little line:""And probably we can predict the moment when the cycle will change.""I do not claim to be all that smart but Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook will just keep outperforming pretty much most stocks out there. They will just keep making billions and billions of dollars from the cloud (microsoft and amazon)  and from online advertising (facebook and amazon). The rate of growth will be very high and these companies just own the field of play. If Buffett thought it was a good idea to own the Washington Post or Capital Cities ABC back in the prehistoric times (because everybody needing to advertise has to pay the newspaper and the tv stations)...imagine the sheer and total dominance of companies like amazon, google, and facebook today. The squiggly lines on a graph cannot show you that. Historical graphs will not show that companies will be spending tens of billions more in online advertising with each passing year and the companies that will benefit will be google, facebook and amazon. Couple that with Amazon and Microsoft's dominance in the cloud and you start to get a clue that maybe the stock prices of these companies will keep going up.",
Beta=risk is one of the true mistakes of financial academia. I’m with Buffett and Graham that risk=losing money. Obviously these stocks will have a high beta now as they have outperformed a consistent prolonged bull market. Not saying some of these stocks are not overvalued but there are better measures of value and the risk of a loss in value for investors who live in reality instead of academia.,
"It all comes back to the essential question if you believe in the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) or not. What has always intrigued me is the fact that Beta is dependent on the time frame which means that you get different messages depending on the time frame you apply, the same is true for correlations. Results differ depending if you calculate them on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. This usually overlooked aspect let me doubt about the concept of Beta and I prefer multi factor based quantitative models because they better reflect the reality of the stock market.",
Past performance is not indicative of future results ...,
Beta is not used by Charlie munger or Buffett. NEXT!!!,
"All indices show a way oversold situation, he is right for his reasons and many others are right because of their stance on a grossly oversold market.Time to take some cash off the table , there will be many buys maybe sooner than we all think",
"Beta in plain language is how much a specific security moves with the market. Since tech companies comprise a large portion of the market, their beta would be high. Over the last decade, those are the companies with highest growth rate and every day, their beta increased because their market weights grew.Why do you think it's an extraordinary event? It doesn't make sense to compare the current beta to historical values for this sector and conclude that they are at risk...",

"Hmmm... thought I had lost access to the article.The Investment Doctor:  To answer your question more fully.....I use EV/BOED, EV/CF, ND/CF and EV/EBITDA to get a rough idea. Typically I use trailing, annualized FFO for cash flow and fully-diluted share counts.After-tax NAV@10% based on 2P reserves per fully-diluted share count is a key metric. In the case of GeoPark, I adjust the measure by subtracting IGI's share of Colombian and Chilean reserves, by applying zero to reserves in Peru and by applying zero to P2 reserves in Brazil and Chile. Probably should apply zero to all of GeoPark's Chilean reserves.  After all those adjustments, the shares still trade at a healthy discount to NAV@10.In the case of Parex Resources I subtract the net working capital surplus from market cap to get enterprise value.  Still trades at a 10% discount to NAV@10 which is an indicator of how leery the overall market is with respect to o&g e&ps.  In a context of greater market enthusiasm, a company like Parex should trade at a healthy premium to NAV@10.  As Brent Crude edges towards US$70/bbl, maybe the mood of the market will change?",

"From DNBLPG SHIPPING SECTOR Zero US export growth in 2018 Since 27 October 2017, our LPG peer group is up 5% compared 6% for the Oslo Stock Exchange. Although US LPG production grows according to forecast (up 8% YTD YOY), a surprisingly strong US domestic LPG demand (up 15% YTD YOY) and lower US LPG inventories YOY has led us to forecast zero US LPG export growth for 2018, for the first time in seven years. This puts both utilisation and rates under pressure to an extent where the peer group’s liquidity could become a concern. Thus, we have reduced our sector view to neutral. Lower rates on lower utilisation. We have lowered our rate forecast for 2018e to ~USD12k/day (down from USD21k/day), 2019e to ~USD18k/day (down from USD31k/day), and 2020e to ~USD28k/day (USD36k/day). 2018e tonne-mile set to decline 1%, while fleet growth set to grow by 3%. We forecast LPG tonne-mile demand growth of -1% for 2018e (down from our previous forecast of 8%), while we have raised 2019e to 13% (from 5%) and 2020e to 6% (from 3%). We have increased our 2018e fleet growth forecast to 2.8% (from 2.5%), 4.0% for 2019e (from 3.0%), and reduced our estimated fleet growth for 2020e to 0.4% (from 1.7%) due to higher scrapping assumption. US production materialised, but surprising demand growth hampered shipping. In our October sector report entitled “It’s coming, but with a slight time lag” we said US LPG production was set to catch up with US oil production growth and accelerate through the year, which it did as Q4 2017 posted 9% YOY growth in US LPG production and YTD is up 8%, in line with forecasts. Still, US propane/propylene stocks are below last year, while net exports YTD are down 22% YOY. Unlike last winter, when US exports led to excessive stock draws, this winter has seen a sudden rise in US consumption of 7% YTD versus the five-year average and 15% YOY after 0% average growth in the last 20 years. We believe cold weather and rising US petrochemical demand are to blame, prompting reductions in our 2018 forecasts, in fact leading to negative growth in US exports YOY, before an improving US balance in 2019–2020e. Last time liquidity was a concern, our peer group was trading at 0.3x NAV. With our LPG peer group priced at an average 0.67x P/NAV, just slightly below its four-year 0.74x average, we see more downside than upside risk with our new 2018–2019e rate forecast below cash break-even, which is set to challenge all three companies’ liquidity. During autumn of 2016 (the last time liquidity was a concern), our LPG peer group was trading at 0.30x NAV, suggesting 55% downside potential for the group. We have downgraded BW LPG to HOLD (from BUY) with target price of NOK31 (down from NOK45), Avance Gas to HOLD (from BUY) with target price of NOK22 (down from NOK28) while we have kept our HOLD and USD8.2 target on Dorian LPG.",
