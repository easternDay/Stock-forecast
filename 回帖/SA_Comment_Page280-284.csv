awsome,
also long jd. what surprised me was that they added more than 26 million customers in this past quarter. i am a bit concerned about their recent expansion efforts. they are investing a lot in china and parts of SE Asia and still investing. would have preferred them to focus on these areas which have great potential in ecommerce before expanding to us and europe. they might be stretching themselves to thin  IMO,

Great podcast guys. I thought you had some great comments. You had some really nice points on making an amazon fence and to look for companies that can do that. One point on why I'm looking for GM to improve right away and why it is important. It's not that GM moving from 66% to 70% is super needed from a profit point. The reason I want to see the margin improve is for credibility of management. Their whole premise was that they need to stop discounting - so margins should improve if that was true right? This is supposed to be the quickest and easiest thing to fix - margins. So that's why it's a milestone - credibility for the rest of the story and should be immediate. Great job and thanks for taking it easy on me.,
Good podcast. Thanks for sharing!,

"Thank you for the well-written analysis. I have been involved for a few years.But I have a significant concern in the drop in EBITDA margin pro forma the cost cutting.- As you note, they reported $313mm in Adj EBITDA in 2015- and they reported $419mm in 2017 on +16% in total sales- and as of Dec 31, 2016, they announced they had implemented $100mm of cost savings. So 2017 should contain at least $100mm of cost savings versus 2015 and probably a bit more.- so pro forma for these costs savings, Adj EBITDA in 2015 was $413mm and we have seen almost no EBITDA growth even though net sales up +16%.- gross margins explain about half of the shortfall, but where is the other half?- SFH growth has happened about as I expected, and I had 2017 Adj EBITDA at about $500mm, much higher than the $419mm realized. I admit that using 2015 gross margin was an error, but even including a lower gross margin, the numbers do not add up. The incremental operating margin from the +16% growth should be much higher than the average operating margin and yet we are not seeing it in the bottom line.What do you suppose is the reason?",

"@aBrick,how long should AAL  or any company continue to be able to use a past merger as an excuse for underperformance?it has now been over 4 years since American emerged from bankruptcy and AAL and USAirways merged. In the same four year period after the DAL and LUV mergers, they had completed labor and operational integration.@robert riesen,your article is good but you don't quantify the impacts of fleet age.  The topic has actually been disclosed quite frequently here on SA, often as part of other airline related articles.The reality is that there is very little meaningful connection between the bottom line and fleet age because the big airlines are very capable of knowing where their airplanes are at a disadvantage to their competitors.Delta's older fleet age is due in part because it bought a significant amount of used airplanes early after bankruptcy in order to minimize capital spending even while making an incremental improvement in capital costs.  The biggest part of its used airplane purchases came from Southwest's elimination of the B717 from the acquired AirTran fleet.   Delta purchased a couple score more MD90s, a larger sister version to the 717 and a derivative of the DC9 family.Now, Delta is focusing its fleet plan on new aircraft, some of which will replace versions of the DC9 family and Delta is able to buy those new aircraft entirely with internally generated cash.  Other airlines took on significant amounts of debt which is why your balance sheet graph above looks like it does.LUV has long bought used aircraft and also increased its acquisition of used 737s as part of its transition away from the second generation of 737s.   It is also noteworthy and ironic that both AAL and UAL are now saying they want to acquire used A319s as many airlines get rid of that model for larger, newer versions of the A320 family.   Fleet age and strategy is highly unique to each airline but the bottom line is that attaching a number to fleet age in a financial analysis connotation should include some connection to cost and profit potential and yet it is pretty hard to do that.Delta has managed to maintain comparable operational costs even with an older fleet and the onus will be on AAL and UAL to do the same even as DAL and LUV increase their purchases of new generation aircraft - which AAL and UAL are also doing - but AAL and UAL also add use aircraft, something that DAL at least doesn't have any stated plans to do.",
"As regard to American Airlines, are you factoring in the continuing merger and system restructuring, coupled with the massive fleet rejuvenation which is complete at American, yet to start at Delta. American's mechanics are not yet under one contract, and the flight attendants are not merged under one seniority list, nor scheduling. Considering these factors, and that the Delta bankruptcy and merger happened many years earlier than American's, I believe that the past performance is not a good indicator of the future.",

"@Shock Exchange If you want a great topic for an article. It would be MYL not including a negative adjustment to adjusted free cash flow for  ""Payments for product rights and other, net"". They add back depreciation then subtract capex, but they add back amortization and DO NOT subtract anything for these payments. If you look at the footnotes in the 10-K there are a bevy of payments with product lives stated. These are very real costs and overstate free cash flow to investors. First 9 months 2018 those payments were $854 million and same period 2017 those payments were $559 million.

This means a substantial GI physicians have realized the drug’s superior efficacy and better side effects over the dominant drug on the market, despite latter’s deep pocketed partner and tremendous amount of commercials.  The recent partnership with this Canadian pharma is further signaling its intent to make more deals internationally and domestically.

They have also negotiated much better Interstate Fees for the Fayetteville going forward.  Then as their Liquids Production triples over the next two years, the net realizations per Mcfe will rise dramatically.  Firm Crude Oil prices are a must.  Then there is the lag effect.  Much of the CapEx in SW Appalachia has not made its way to the Market.  Production there is going to explode.  Then there is the Natural Gas Market.  Production is going to need to rise 10 BCF/day by mid 2019 to meet demand.  This is a growth industry and SWN is in a great position to capture market share.

"my_city, folks were saying la Nina would drive storage below the bottom of the five year range.   That's not happening.  in fact we may see an early increase in storage level as companies get cranking on dumping more gas into their mess.  Based on some recent hedges I have seen I really think most companies realize gas isn't going over 3 bucks for a looong time.  My only question is how low are managements willing to go to collect their production bonuses. The bluster over increasing production is reminisant of a few years ago when gas went sub 2 bones.  Power plant managers are licking their chops as gas producers jump hand stands to destroy their own companies to give away gas.  What power plant is going to hedge gas even close to 3 dollars as gas producers telegraph more suicidal intentions to grow their losses?",

"Unfortunately we are seeing the same old story from just about every E&P, and it's all a result of how this industry has managed to set itself up for a monumental collapse.  When virtually all companies main focus is cost reductions on one side and increased production on the other side, the cost reduction side will lose.  The price of the good sold has no bottom but costs per unit sold can't go to zero.  So with all companies swimming in the same direction (again...) we now have more rigs than ever before, when you take into account the incredible 90% drop in the time it takes to bring on new wells, during a period of falling prices.  SWN and others plans will fail because hedging opportunities probably won't support debt payments, which managements love to poo poo because they are 3 years away.   E&Ps without fail over estimate future prices of natural gas. Always have always will. Prices are headed below 2.50 and 2018 hedges are insuring further price destruction as ALL companies drill within cash flow, another pathetic part of the story, which will only result in higher production in the out years. When I listen to earnings calls it is amazing how these overpaid CEO's all lay out the same basic one size fits all approach and no one asks the real tough questions.  No one has to look for gas anymore.  It's all there ready to be pumped out with assembly line efficiency by way too many companies chasing comparatively pathetic demand. SWN and the rest do not have a plan to survive under these circumstances...but management WILL GET PAID MEGA BUCKS even as shareholder take the pipe.  One just needs to look at the steep increase in shale production with a fraction of the historical rig count.  Shale decline curves?  Big deal.  None of the old arguments for lower supply and higher demand matter anymore.  They have all come and gone..",

But this is not unique to SWN. Most other crude/NG producers are trading at prices significantly higher than their net PV10. Why?",

This article is out of date and has missed the real reason for the tariff...NAFTA.Read my last Friday's post in...https://seekingalpha.c......where I said this was all about NAFTA.Grant,
"Many writers and commenters have NO knowledge of the ""trade war""that has been carried out by Japan,China and Europe against US products such as cars ,agricultural products, beef,and numerous other US produced products for over the last 40 years. Over the years these countries have repeatedly dumped their industrial overcapacity into the US at discounted prices.They have also applied tariffs to American products and /or regulated American products out of their markets. Also, As foreign manufactures moved into the US they brought their home country manufactures with them eliminating opportunities for traditional US based companies to do business with the foreigner manufacturer . The impact of this ""trade war"" can be seen in the ""rust belt"" ,the Southeast  and Midwest .No president  or Congress has  addressed this devastation to American manufacturing by foreign competitors much of which was financed unfairly  through there respective government entities. This has been going on for 30-40 years devastating many in the middle-class creating many financial and social problems as well as overall economic problems. Renegotiating NAFTA, other trade agreements, stopping the dumping into the US, tariffs (if need be) are actions required to maintain and rebuild American industry. The middle of the country ,aka-""fly over country ""(so named by the coastal elites) has paid the price for these ""Foreign Trade Wars on the US"".",

"I find it interesting that your cost impact analysis only looked at the two models least impacted by the tariff, the 787 and 777-300.  The 737 is basically an all aluminum airplane, and it is also the highest rate airplane that Boeing builds.  Further, large parts of that airplane are built by suppliers who have significant leverage over Boeing.  While I agree that the overall cost impact to Boeing will not be that large it will still hurt their bottom line.The bigger impact is the possibility of a trade war, and that could be devastating to Boeing.  All China has to do is cancel about half of its orders, or stretch out the deliveries by many years, and Boeing will definitely feel the pain.",
"First, this is not an attempt by me to stoke the Democrats vs Republicans debate. For the record, I'm not a fan of politics/politicians..... inclusive! But, effective negotiating must be a fluid process. What frightens most is the fact (irregardless of your personal opinion of the individual in office) that we have not had an official US representative, in any capacity, attempt to negotiate a beneficial outcome for the American people on any agreements in probably the past 30 year or so, irregardless of party affiliation. So, it is somewhat of a shock for people to experience, who have never witnessed in their adult lifetime, one of our politicians attempting to put America in a stronger position for negotiating anything/whatever is on the table. When weakness has been the norm for such a long period this approach simply scares people. Don't panic, whether tariffs become a reality or not this is simply a negotiating process and posturing is a very large part of the success or failure of the process.",

"I've often wondered how many S A authors actually have had responsibility of say a 20 million dollar organization...When Macy’s announced it would close its doors at Beaver Valley Mall for good last year, the department store left behind two floors of real estate in an area that’s expecting growth as a new petrochemical plant moves into the neighborhood.The empty store was an opportunity for the right tenant. But the new owners won’t be selling shoes, men’s suits and cookware.Moving and storage company U-Haul bought the space in January for $1.5 million.The location has been a department store since the mall opened in 1970. Now, the plan is to turn part of the first floor into a U-Haul showroom, with the remaining first-floor space to be leased out.And the second floor that once held Tommy Hilfiger sweaters and Calvin Klein suits? Soon you’ll be able to store that dining set you don’t know what to do with yet. The plan is to convert the second floor into self-storage space, according to Bob Bourgeois, president of U-Haul Co. of Pittsburgh.Reusing vacant storefronts is happening at shopping centers over the country, and Beaver Valley Mall is no exception. In recent years, the all-retail business model has shifted to more of a mixed-use destination. The mall hosts the Beaver County Office on Aging, DCI Career Institute and a CareerLink location. Other malls have welcomed churches, community services, medical centers and escape rooms.Right now, the 200,000-square-foot space acquired by U-Haul  is unmistakable as a former Macy’s.",

Some of these malls are the major attraction to shoppers for miles around. Therefore if these malls can adapt to changing consumer needs, they should be fine in the future."" ...is exactly right.Great analysis.",
"The writer is correct when he says that many B and C malls operate in secondary markets that are many miles away from major markets and the better malls in those markets. These malls will not all close and many will continue to serve those markets and do well. Let’s look at one such mall owned by WPG in such a market that I picked randomly and may not be representative. Mesa Mall is a 873,467 square foot enclosed mall located in Grand Junction, Colorado.  Grand Junction is in western Colorado on Interstate 70 and the metropolitan area has a population of around 150,000. It takes around 4 hours to drive to either Denver or Salt Lake City from Grand Junction. As far as I can tell the Mesa Mall is the only major retail project in the Grand Junction area. WPG owns roughly half of the space with the other half being owned by  tenants.  The mall is anchored by Cabelas, Target, Sears, JCPenney, and Herberger’s (Sports Authority closed their store in 2016 as part of the liquidation of the company). I am going to guess that Sear’s, Target and JCPenney own their stores. I am going to further guess that WPG owns the Cabelas and Herberger’s stores. The good news is that these anchor stores are open and operating and in 2017 WPG was able to buy the mall from the lender at a large discount to the mortgage loan secured by the property.  The bad news is that Sears, JCPenney and Herberger’s are all struggling department stores.  Sear’s has closed hundreds of stores and will likely file for bankruptcy protection this year. The situation for JCPenney is not as dire; but, this retailer is also struggling and has also closed dozens of stores. Herberger’s is owned by Bon Ton and Bon Ton filed for bankruptcy protection in February (the Mesa Mall store is not on an initial list of 42 stores to be closed). So, there is at least some risk that Mesa Mall could end up with three empty anchor stores (in addition to the Sports Authority box that appears to remain empty).  These stores likely represent a small, if any, portion of the rents at Mesa Mall; but, the original premise of a mall  was the idea of having two, three, four or more anchor stores that would attract shoppers. These anchors would pay little to no rent in return for generating traffic. The mall owner would then lease at higher rents smaller spaces located around and between the anchor stores. Shoppers would come to the mall because of the anchors; but, then also shop at the smaller stores. Vacant anchor stores do not attract shoppers. Unless the vacant anchor stores are replaced with new attractive anchor tenants, the small shop tenants begin to suffer and ultimately close.  The downward spiral then begins. This is the risk associated with B and C malls in secondary and tertiary markets.  WPG has 42 stores with Sears, 38 with JCPenney, and 15 with Bon Ton. I am sure that some of these stores are great stores in great locations that could quickly be replaced with even better anchors; but, many would sit empty forever should they be closed.",
"My strategy for years has been to avoid the malls. Especially the low grade malls like WPG and CBL. One of the fallacies of the mall space is that most malls are grade A or B. What use is a grading system if there are no D or F grades given. If one is an investor in WPG, consider that many of the malls that are bandied about as ""B"" malls are in fact in the bottom 30% of the scale. It's just not PC to call these malls out.Even SPG which is touted as having top tier, some SPG malls should be rated ""C"" class. So you can imagine where WPG lines up on this farcical grading scale.As I have been advising for years, avoid the mall space. If you must invest in malls, choose only SPG or TCO, and enter only near multi year lows. For instance I bought TCO a few months ago when it fell under $50. I have a limit order on SPG to start a toe dip at $120. Be a qualtiy and price nazi. PS. Here we have been in a perfect storm for malls, all time highs on stocks and housing, low gas prices, low unemployment, low interest rates. Malls should be killing it right now, yet they have been getting hammered... why? If they cannot kill it in this environment, how do you figure they will do come the next recession?",

Than in the lead.Sic Bo Intelligent Butler RobotDiversified application scenarios open a new era of intelligent robot stewardsAccording to the reporter’s understanding, Sicbo smart housekeeper robots will also be on-line to order functions such as takeaways, voice taxis, and road conditions, and will cooperate with more third-party platforms focusing on family application scenarios to maximize the satisfaction Consumer appeal. At the scene of Henan CIFIT, the reporter also interviewed the dealers who came to the booth for consultation. Most dealers expressed that they are very optimistic about the prospects for the development of the home smart robot industry. One of the dealers said in an interview that he is a smart home fan. He was very interested in products related to the smart home industry. He first represented early-agers in intelligent robots and responded well to the initial market. Later, with the increasing acceptance and demand of smart robot products by domestic consumers, there were many different brands of early childhood education on the market. Robots have more people and less profits. At the same time, many consumers revealed to him that there are too many types of intelligent robots on the market and that the unit price of robots is too high. Many families cannot meet the needs of a single family application scenario. Buy a variety of intelligent robot products, so he always wanted to find a comprehensive intelligent robot, this time participating in the CIFIT is to take a try to participate in the mentality of mind, did not think that it was really right.

"I seem to recall that Tesla dropped the Model S and Model X from three shifts down to two shifts.  It isn't very surprising that their sales would be down about 33% as a result.  That is it more than 33% by a significant margin is a surprise.I have to wonder if Tesla knew their sales were dropping significantly and cut production in anticipation.  The alternative is that Tesla has a lithium or cobalt shortage.  For those that say Panasonic is taking care of that, I recall Elon Musk personally traveling to different mines to secure supplies.  That isn't to say that he was successful, he might simply have been trying to do a hard sell.I will be amazed if this turns out to be true and doesn't crash the stock between April 2 and earnings.

I am not sure how he will be able to manage the stroke size debt that grows with each car sale but it may help to keep in mind that Tesla is also an energy company.  If the climate change experts are right and the world is indeed getting hotter then solar has a great future.  From panels to roof tiles to windows to sidewalks to roads to whatever, there are plenty of surfaces that can potentially generate a current.  If the experts are wrong, and the world enters a cooling period, well as an energy company, perhaps Elon will tackle wind or wave power in the future as there will be less sun and more wind with bigger waves.

Elon went from threatening suppliers on earnings calls to make sure they were ready August 1 and how they didn’t want to be the one supplier who was late to profusely apologizing to them 9 months later as it was Tesla who was not ready.,

"This just in!   Elon Musk is rolling up Tesla into SpaceX hereby avoiding bankruptcy.  Musk claims that Tesla is really a space company anyway citing the Tesla that was recently turned into spacejunk. Musk explained, “well, you...stutter, stutter know, I was not being totally honest.. Tesla is a terrestrial company that just happens to make a few earth bound cars.” The CNbc interviewer responded by telling Musk how wonderful he was and soooo smart, they ended the interview by smiling silently at each other for seconds before agreeing that Trump was evil.   t",
"It's only approximately a 20% sales miss. You have to remember, TSLA works off sentiment. It's like a Looney Tunes cartoon, where the coyote gets to sit in mid-air for quite some time. Moreover, we're in late expansion territory where bubbles are popping up all over the place, and you know what? The easiest way to lose money is to bet on the bubble popping before it actually pops.Where Tesla bulls are ultimately going to be in a world of pain is if the market, i.e, beta, pops, and drags all equities down. A recession comes next, then Tesla has difficulty getting financing, has difficulty moving vehicles, and difficulty paying its bonds. Musk's gamble is that he can scale TSLA to sustainability before that happens, but watching the Trump tariffs as well as expanding inflation... you never know.",
"Author: If Tesla knows that it did approximately 11,548 units in January and February combined, and it knows at this point that getting to approximately 40,000 for the March quarter as a whole is all but impossible, is it required to let the investing public know as soon as possible, right now, or is it permissible to wait until after the quarter has ended?You expect a con to be truthful? Same thing as you expect a cultist to use his/her empty head... You are wasting your time.... Let's just sell this more  :)",
yawn ....go Tesla !,
https://bloom.bg/2Bvl7ED Bloomberg has dropped the estimate for the Model 3 rate to 667 per week. Has Tesla announced any temporary shutdown? The peak rate was two weeks back and was always below 1000/week.,
"The government tax credits ($7500 per vehicle) are limited (200,000 per manufacturer I think).  The Tesla rebates will soon run out and people will have to pay full price.  When this realization hits people, I wonder what will happen to sales.  Instead of trying to ramp up production, Tesla should have partnered with one of the big automakers that could crank out production for them.",
"You have made a mathematical error, 2500 Model3's times 52 weeks= 130,000 vehicles not 30,000 like you stated, that is deceiving.",
What about all the propaganda about huge increases in sales of model X/S and of course the hype for model 3.   Is the truth about no one wanting these cars finally coming out or can they hide the facts a bit longer.,
"I normally don't respond to Anton's articles since he himself does not respond but rather just slings whatever Tesla negative crap he can conjure to see if it sticks.So Tesla delivered 2485 M3s in February. Sounds terrible unless you consider thats about the same amount of GM Bolts delivered in BOTH January AND February COMBINED!  This at a time when GM has the greatest opportunity to try to poach base model 3 sales from wait weary deposit holders dealing with Tesla's delayed ramp.What are we to make of this especially Anton who is long GM? Have Bolt sales fallen off a cliff?What will happen to Bolt sales when GM's Fed tax credit expires in around the same timeframe as Tesla?   No comment Anton? Hint: They'll be lucky to sell any at that point and it will die a quiet death. Such a shame since it was a truly inspired design derived from various thrown together parts bins and suppliers with a terrible drag coefficient of .32Even GM's EV1 from over two decades ago had an M3 matching .20 .     Drag coefficients are essential to EV design. Jaguar shows you a picture of a big wind tunnel in their elaborate presentation of I-pace but doesn't mention its CD because its nothing to brag about.So Bolt and I-pace have oversized batteries in relation to specs which no doubt costs them in both weight and production costs. That's OK because their tiny infotainment screens, second rate IT, lack of current charging networks, and non existent over the air vehicle updates will surely steal Tesla buyers away in droves. GET REAL!!!Jaguar even has to use deception in its hoopla video with a pretend deliberately obnoxiousTesla lover in a ridiculous  0-60-0 ( no enthusiast pub uses this metric) race by mentioning after narrowly being beaten in a bigger, heavier, and more spacious 75D if only I had a P100D....Then they play bait and switch using 100D not P100D in second ridiculous 0-60-0 ( only spec Jag could figure out to beat Tesla with) match.  Nice! Let me clue you all in: It's nearly impossible for a driver in 0-60 in 2.9 sec (4.5 for Jag) over 1G X P100D acceleration run to accurately make the transition from full throttle to brake at precisely 60 MPH. Thats why we have timed quarter mile runs with electronic instrumentation which I'm sure Jag has no interest in since they'll asses handed to em. So rest of this dubious demo is filled with common design and testing methods used by everybody including Tesla with an innuendo that somehow Tesla forgoes such design due diligence. Tesla doesn't like most shorts somehow wish were true. No, sorry for all new ""kings of BEV"" but Tesla has very noticeably superior specs across the board.This will be maintained going forward with refreshes and continual battery improvements. Still waiting to see Ferrari's  BEV supercar (what Ferrari making a BEV? ) specs will be to challenge Tesla Roadster2. As of now there isn't an ICE production car real or even on drawing board that will match it....",
"Author wrote ""Can Tesla deliver a similar number - 11,548 - in March alone?""Seems unlikely considering that the 4Q numbers were achieved only by moving a lot of inventory.  This bites twice: by artificially inflating 4Q17 and by putting a strain on 1Q18 as some inventory may need replenishment.",
Great stock to be short !!!,
The very reason why people are talking about EVs is Tesla otherwise GM would have been losing money and still selling clunkers to Americans. GM will eventually fold one more time though I don't know how Tesla will survive but seems like will.,
"Anton, can you name me even one other stock that is losing $11.83 per share and is priced at 335?It's incredible.Imagine if Tesla were earning $11.83 per share instead of losing $11.83 per share. The price of the stock might even be as high as 335,000 per share.You have to hand it to Elon Musk.  He is a master salesman.He wants to send 100,00 people to Mars.  I can't afford to go to Mars.  I'll bet that a one way ticket would be very expensive.And, frankly, I don't like cold climates.  That's why I am in Jupiter now.  Jupiter, Florida.  Not the planet Jupiter.I wonder if Elon Musk will go with those 100,000 people to Mars.Space exploration could potentially be very interesting.Mankind has walked on the moon.If Musk has his way, men and even women will be walking on Mars.And who knows what planets are next?Jupiter?  Saturn?  Uranus?I probably won't live to see it.  An astronaut planting an American flag on Uranus.No Tesla car dealerships near me in Jupiter, Florida.  I wouldn't mind taking a Tesla out for a spin.  Do they sell convertibles?",
"If Tesla ever hit guidance for ANYTHING the stock would probably crash to single digits inside a few hours. It would mean their aspirations are smaller than their capabilities - game over! If Tesla announced that all Model 3's shipped so far were being recalled and crushed for quality issues, the stock would go through the roof!",
Definitely a bait and switch fraud not disclosed until the last few weeks,
"Under the landmark California case of Silver Hills country club versus Sobieski, The $1000 reservation scam instituted by tesla would be considered a security that could be the subject of a 10 B5 action for fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.",

On another note they have ONE Model 3 on display in Littleton and none in the lot and there was a crate there for a new pano roof. If they are having design issues(flaws) causing them to replace roofs the negative margins on the Model 3 are goin to explode....,
Strong rumor has it that Tesla has been driving electric tractor-trailers  [the cab (the front part)] back and forth from Fremont to gigafactory for many months. THAT IS (WOULD BE) A GIANT GAME CHANGER. If it is successful in its endeavors.,
"I guess the question becomes people; who wins when Tesla's equity price crashes and they can no longer raise capital through the equity or bond market?  The Tesla automobile buyers who got a huge tax credit from their respective county and an automobile below cost?  The company employees who received and cashed in on their equity options?  The bond holders who will have to take the company into receivership.  Or, is Tesla a venture capitalist green project that has become ""to important to fail"" by way of political agenda? After all of us Shorts make our money (including me!), the citizens of the countries around the world who had to subsidize those who could afford to buy a $100K green automobile should be, well, pissed off because there the only group that has nothing to show from this pending disaster.",
"Tho Anton is great at publishing facts , his ability to be non bias and give a clear accurate picture of anything is seriously in question.  Readers beware .  This is not serious reporting but amusement and fodder.  Now, can someone with real writing talent take Anton’s data and put together a true picture of Tesla? If the sky were truly imploding as I write Monday market would be a total washout for Tesla but most people know it will be business as usual and money whenever they ask for it for Tesla for the entire month.Stay tuned .",
"The ""$35,000"" Model 3 imaginary vehicle will never be sold because it will never be built, anymore than Tesla built their promised ""$49,000"" Model S. Tesla produces vaporwaremore than anything else. The company is now trailing in recharge times for cars like the Porsche Mission e about to be launched in 2019 (eating Tesla's lunch in the process) , trailing in driving ranges of cars that cost half as much , and about to trail cars that cost one third as much from Japan.  And about to be overtaken and then overwhelmed by higher speed CCS charging networks. If that's not enough, Tesla loses its $7500 Govt welfare per car and must face their overwhelming competition with a $7500 price disadvantage. Tesla's Model 3 waiting list is not growing and when the competiiton like the Polestar and others come to market, the company's founder, who has only succeeded in business arenas in which he has a monopoly, will find out first hand what competition is all about. All electric cars are quiet, and all require little maintenance (although Tesla's required maintenance costs twice as much as BMW's) and all can accelerate rapidly and corner well. Tesla's cultist fans simply don't understand the technology, which began before WW1.",

You can't beat Tesla up over China market share. Import duty is 25% and Tesla does not get any EV incentives like the local Chinese brands. So that means Tesla is 30-50% more expensive just due to Chinese government anti-US import practises.,

Yes Virginia, even ""artisanally crafted"", ""untested"" Model 3s ""beta units"" are now outselling Tesla's previous #1 Killer.  Jaguar, your turn.  Lucid/VW/Audi you're on deck.",
Someone must have lost his shirt shorting Tesla.,
"I think the key of this analysis is the fact that Tesla's now famous ""increasing demand"" statement, combined with the increased wait time had led longs to conclude that the model 3 was not, in fact, cannibalizing sales of the X and S, as had been feared. One of the short arguments had been that the model 3 would cannibalize sales of Tesla's higher end and higher margin products. Tesla's statement was seen as proof that argument was wrong. These numbers, however, would tend to say the opposite, proving the original short theory correct.",
"Anton - Don't forget about the huge sales to China and Hong Kong during Q1'17.  Nearly 4,000 units went to Hong Kong alone and China had big numbers as well.  That will not repeat.  http://bit.ly/2sKHIJa",
@ Anton WahlmannThank you for the interesting facts and thoughtsCould you even cite the part of Tesla's documents where they admit that the Model 3 is having a negative gross margin even at a selling price of 50.000 Dollars?Disclosure: I am short Tesla.,

I bet it’s the fault of the Bush administration.,

My feeling is that Tesla can already produce more Model 3's then it can sell.   They have 500,000 orders from people who are willing to lease a Model 3 for ~$400/month, but I think there are very few people willing to buy a $50-60K Model 3 which is the only option currently.",
being long GM might be your big mistake.  the rest of it all makes sense .....,
So..how are sales in Skandinavia?You seem to be ignoring Tesla's biggest overseas market.,
"When a company sells most of its sales right before the end of the quarter, you know what they are doing! They resort to acts of desperation, usually gigantic discounts in order to ""move the metal"" and meet the sales target. That works...........until it doesn't, meaning you have done it so often that you drained the pool of discount buyers out there and your sale offer falls on deaf ears. Sales then suddenly plunge and the company has to confess that it really has weak demand that it was doing its best to masquerade as long as it could. Tesla has always had weak demand and has been hiding it with aggressive end of quarter discounting. Eventually that approach will fail",
It will be interesting to see if Musk is indicted for securities fraud. Unclear to me how he differs from Ken Lay.,
"No, Tesla does not have to pre-announce a 42% sales miss. The author's use of this language is highly misleading. Tesla can't have a sales miss because they simply refused to issue guidance for the quarter. So there can't be any ""miss"" vis a vis guidance. They provided production ""targets"" for the M3 for just the final week of March, and that will almost certainly be a miss. But they will be announcing the results just days after that miss.It's too bad that the author decided to use a misleading and click-baiting frame for his article. This distracts from the otherwise useful analysis showing that Tesla is having trouble making and/or selling cars. The S&X sales woes are particularly instructive for people who think that Tesla has huge demand.",

"They spent a whole lot of money last year or two to build the new distribution center.  However, that is done now, so net profit margin should get some help from this, along with the benefit from the tax cut.  Everyone should think what the share price should be if they come out in a couple of weeks saying that earnings should stay higher than 3$ per share over coming yeaar, and they will start to step up their share buyacks???  Expect a possible double in share price over coming year.  Look at KORs over the last year, it doubled!!!",
"I think the tax rate cut will be a huge tail wind. They're mainly doing business in North America and they actually earn money, in contrast to Amazon. So this should be a massive benefit for BBBY going forward. Something I am missing form the article; the board still has the authority to buyback $1.5B of their own stock. Thus, theoretically they could buy back half of the company. Which gives you a stock price of at least $40.I cannot imagine selling BBBY at this price because of these two factors.",
"Agreed BBBY is cheap, yet will likely get cheaper.  Looking at EV/S ratios of retailers, ASNA and PIR seem to be even better bargains while maintaining somewhat favorable financials that you point out for BBBY.

"You say in this article that is dated 3/4/18   ""Pandora has announced that they plan to lay off 5% of their 2,500 person workforce. ""    Don't you mean to say that Pandora has already done this?  Or are you saying there is another 5% layoff in addition to what has already happened?",
"I can not figure out why anyone would invest in P. The music business is vicious and they have no path that I can see to gaining profitability. When did these investors decide that this company, above all others, was the best chance for future profits? Given the success of Spotify as a private company generating a solid user base I worry about them going public. Why? If you already have such a solid business and a path to being profitable then why would you do this instead of taking on debt at low rates? Looks to me like they are in desperate need of a cash inflow. Can anyone name a stand alone streaming music service that generates a profit? I'll be watching but I predict that neither P nor SPOT will gain profitability unless they diversify away from music as their only service. The really brutal thing for them is that they aren't sticky. Many people I know flip flop from SPOT to Apple and back as discounts are offered. Others maintain both services. Just goes to show that there likely wouldn't even be a chance for a buyout from someone looking to gain more market share. I would consider trading SPOT if I could get in at the DCO price because it will likely pop, but I would be ready to take profits ASAP.",
"Flop companies.Spotify’s financials are garbage and they continue to have nothing proprietary. They’re beholden to the record labels and will feel mounting pressure when rates continue to rise. They’ve signaled their willingness to get into hardware, so best of luck going toe to toe with the streaming music service providers already into audio hardware.",
"Could be a good trade, though P is not out of the woods yet on a fundamental basis. But let's be fair, as the average (not high) private trades seem to put SPOT at an EV closer to $16-17B while P is around $1.5B including all of the convertible preferreds. Still, a 10X differential sounds like a lot but SPOT's on an EV/Sales basis SPOT's at 3X growing top-line at 40% and P at 1X and little visibility on sustainable growth.",

"Since this is on an APPL board I’d be more interested in how it might or might not affect APPL moving forward. My guess is that Spotify and Pandora need to justify their valuations, whereas for APPL this is a drop the bucket and they can afford streaming music as a “loss leader” to further strengthen their ecosystem.",

I also don't know what P is worth but what I DO KNOW is that if SPOT is worth between $16-23 billion, P is worth lots more than $1 billion.  That said, a publicly traded SPOT will only go to further that distinction.  Ultimately, it seems to come down to a binary outcome.  Given its large user base, P is clearly worth something and it is only a matter of time until one of the myriad media players recognizes that and neatly tucks P within its ambit.",

Obviously for struggling unknown bands they’ll take whatever paltry check offered but bestselling musicians are starting to flex their muscles and say no.   There are ongoing lawsuits about this.

"Do people realize that glasses aren't a sure thing... look what happened to Google Glass, it was so promising and then, seemingly overnight, the product disappeared.",
"The Apple Watch is not perfect.  I don’t think that anybody, including Apple has ever claimed that.  Let’s get the single greatest weakness of the Apple Watch out of the way first, i.e.  the need to recharge the device every day.  Yes, yes, I know that the Watch can go longer than 24 hours without a charge but you would not want to venture out with only a 30% charge on your watch in the morning because you would be guaranteed to have a dead watch by lunch time.  So, that means, for most people, is that you have to take the watch off at nights and charge it for several hours.  A corollary to that weakness is that you have to take the Watch off to charge.  When that happens, you don’t have a watch to see the time when you wake up and it cannot be used effectively to monitor your sleep, one of the more useful functions that an Apple Watch can be used for.  For a device that tells time, Apple Watch is not expensive.  It is hard to buy a watch for much less than $350 these days, especially if it has any kind of electronic function in it at all, including resetting its time automatically when you fly.  The prices of watches that automatically wind are in the stratosphere these days (have you looked at the price of a Rolex these days).  On the other hand, many of us already have a watch that tells the time and date.  So, when we buy an Apple Watch, it usually is to replace the one that we currently wear or wore.  From that perspective, the fact that Apple now makes more money per year than the watch sales of Switzerland is quite an accomplishment.  No watch made by anybody has ever have outsold Swiss watches.   So, will Apple solve the recharging problem any time soon?  I doubt it very much.  The more functions that Apple put into the Watch, the shorter its battery life will be.  I decided not to buy the Series 3 Watch because it will not have a longer battery life than Series 2 and I already have my iPhone and AirPods to make calls with.  So, I developed the following solution for Watch charging problem.  I use a Belkin “Valet Charger Power Pack ($100)” for the Apple Watch, which has 6700 mAh, sufficient to charge the Watch 8 times, or enough for a week.  I carry it in a small pouch with a rubber band, which holds the watch to the charger in the pouch.  When the Apple watch is not charging in the pouch, I carry an old stainless steel Rolex that my father gave me in 11th grade in the pouch.  I exchange my Apple Watch for the Rolex, so I have something to tell me the time, while the Apple Watch is charging.I have given some thought to buying a second Apple Watch so that I can wear one while the other is charging.  Unfortunately, Apple has not yet developed the software to hand off data monitoring by two or more Watches.  It should not be difficult for them to do.  When they do, I will buy the Series 3 or Series 4 to supplement my current Series 2.   Having continuous 24 hour monitoring and data collection is necessary to determine sleep, exercise, and movement patterns.   Until then, my solution of swapping the Apple Watch with my old Rolex will have to do.  It would be nice to be able to determine my sleeping patterns over time.  Short of keeping a diary, which is difficult by the way, I don’t really know how many hours I sleep and my cardiac rates at sleep, rest, and when I do my daily activities and exercise.Some people have been disparaging Apple Watch’s ability to monitor heart rates, saying that it is not that useful.  In my opinion, the claim that heart rate does not tell you much is wrong.  Heart rate provides very important information concerning not just your heart but also stress and activities of the body.  Let me go through some of the more important insights that the Apple Watch can provide not only for you but your doctor:1. Resting heart rate and Longevity.  Many studies have shown a high inverse correlation between longevity and resting heart rate [http://nyti.ms/2FVLAvy].  Your heart averages about 80 beats/hour, 115,200 beats/day, and >42 million per year.  In an average lifetime of course 72 years, a human heart will have beaten at least 3 billion times.  Whales have heart rates of 30-35 beats/minute while mice have 600-700/minute.  Most mammals live for only a billion heart beats.  The following article is interesting because it shows that humans are a real outlier, living an average of 3 billion heart beats: [http://bit.ly/2CXpkyf].  We have long known that regular exercise, which transient increases heart rate, reduces mortality and causes of mortality.  What is interesting is that regular exercise, while it increases heart rate transiently, lowers the overall resting heart rate.  There is no other way other than an wearable to collect data like how many times your heart beats per month or per year.  Apple is now engaged in several clinical studies to determine the relationship between heart rate, exercise, and longevity, using the Apple Watch.2. Arrythmias.  A major cause of death (possibly even the most important preventable cause of death) is cardiac arrhythmias.   Atrial fibrillation, paradoxical atrial tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions are potentially important signs of impending cardiac dysfunction in people who have underlying cardiac disease such as coronary artery disease or previous myocardial infarctions.  So, for people who have cardiac problems, heart rate monitoring may save their lives.  For people who have normal hearts, it probably is not that important.  For example, in the 1980’s studies of people who have frequent PVCs of as many as 500 per hour did not show any significantly higher risk of mortality, particularly if the PVCs appear after exercise or emotional stress.  On the other hand, the studies underway should identify patterns of heart rate changes that are dangerous and should be investigated for the presence of underlying heart disease.  People who have PVCs that occur more than 1/4 beats should be investigated [http://bit.ly/2FTJlZJ].3. Oxygen saturation can now be monitored by the Apple watch.  While this data may be useful for people who have pulmonary problems or diabetes.  Such information may be useful for serious athletes who are monitoring their metabolism and oxygen carrying capacity.  It should useful for mountain climbers or people living at high altitudes.  As it turns out, the Apple watch is equipped with ability to measure blood oxygen saturation and Apple is trying to get FDA approval for use of the monitoring for diagnostic purposes [http://bit.ly/2FeQzGe].  Several companies have developed software to use the data, e.g. iHealth.  4. Glucose.  The Apple Watch currently needs an external bluetooth device to monitor glucose.  Several devices and apps have been approved by the FDA for measuring and sending glucose data to the iPhone.  For example, the iHealth Smart will allow glucose strips to be read directly into the iPhone that will keep a record of the reading and display the data [http://bit.ly/2FVLBzC].  The most recent articles say that Apple Watch non-invasive glucose monitoring is likely to be years off [http://bit.ly/2D0kjET].  On the other hand, a recent study based on data from 14,000 users of DeepHart, a popular Apple Watch app that was developed in conjunction with the UCSF Cardiology department, has shown that the Apple watch can identify people with diabetes with 85% accuracy [http://bit.ly/2FVLDaI], as well as sleep apnea, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.  These data were presented on February 7 last month.5. Blood pressure.  The Apple watch alone cannot take a blood pressure reading.  You need a connected device such as QardioArm and a companion App to do so.  However, a recent report suggests that the Apple Watch can measure blood pressure indirectly with a sensor band.  The Apple Watch can detect electrocardiogram (EKG) or the electrical activity produced by the heart.  A sensor band can detect the arrival of a blood pressure pulse at the wrist.  The time difference between the EKG and the wrist pulse gives you the pulse transit time (PTT) which is related to blood pressure in several ways.  The Apple Watch should also be able to detect the pulse from the change in oxygen saturation and thereby be able to estimate PTT.  The technology is not yet widely available, probably because it is undergoing tests for FDA approval [http://bit.ly/2xVCXwM]I think that it is fair to say that the Apple Watch is and will be the best available device for monitoring heart rate, arrhythmias, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure on the market.  There is still a lot of development yet to come but the Apple Watch has the sensors, the computing power, and the apps to store data in the iPhone to make such monitoring meaningful in the next year or two.  When it happens, this should boost Apple Watch sales significantly around the world.  The health and sports applications will be very significant.  Finally, the Apple Watch will likely be used to monitoring rehabilitation and exercise of people with chronic spinal cord injury and stroke.  Walking and counting the number of times a person gets up can now be done with many available devices but the availability of cardiac monitoring, pulse transit time, and oxygen saturation would be very important additional data.  This market is not trivial.  Close to 100 million people around the world have stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and other causes of paralysis.",
"Over the past several years, Apple has formed partnerships with the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Duke Medical Center, Stanford Medicine and other top medical research institutions to identify high value-added healthcare apps for Apple Watch and iPad. I am confident the future benefits from these initiatives will be significant for Apple and tough for competitors to match. The partnerships Apple has formed in the enterprise space with IBM, Cisco, SAP, Deloitte and Accenture should also help as regards to applications for medical institutions.",
"I have an Apple Watch Series 3, just got it in December. I haven't activated cellular service for it, because I spend half of my life on a ship in a remote part of the world with poor, if any cellular service. I bought it for the current, and future, health monitoring functions, but have also learned to like the communications capabilities and the link to any alerts/alarms/notifica... on the iPhone. I will be buying one for my wife, very soon. She just had knee surgery, and it will be of great assistance by allowing her to answer her phone, or call for assistance, even if the phone is not within her reach.I think that one of the strong points of the current state of monitoring and health apps for the Apple Watch is the impact on health consciousness and awareness...and the prompts to exercise, move, breathe, etc. Don't forget the option to have an alert if you're resting and your heart rate suddenly jumps to 120 bpm.I'm pretty sure health insurance companies will like the additional information about the insured actually being, measurably, proactive about their health. I believe Aetna has provided Apple Watches to their employees, and is looking at using them for their clients. I also just signed up to participate in the Apple Heart Study, don't know what will come of it (or if they won't throw me off when I go dark for months at a time...hopefully the data is all saved locally and they can get the update when I return to civilization).I think wearables are going to be a big part of Apple revenue going forward, with all the monitoring, communication, security, and payment capabilities...and things we haven't yet conceived.Almost forgot...long Apple...(wish I'd hung on to the shares I had back in 1999/2000, my wife won't let me forget!)",

"I have an Apple Seres 2 watch and mainly use it for tracking fitness. The heart rate monitor seem reasonably accurate but there are times when it fails to get a reading. I especially like it when I am running up a hill and the heart rate is grayed out. All I can do is scream inside of my head..lolIf I place my phone inside my camelback water backpack, I can answer a phone call and use the watch as the phone which is handy.I don’t check messages or use Amy apps other than the exercise app Strava. However being able to check emails and texts, etc is handy but I primarily bought the watch for exercise and fitness tracking.Chest straps for heart rate monitors from Polar are still more accurate than the light sensor method,Apple incorporates into their watch but it’s still good. Even chest straps lose connections at times and you need to replace the battery as well in them.So in summary it’s not perfect but convenient and reliable enough for the average fitness enthusiast but for high level athletes, it’s not ready for prime time until they get more accurate heart rate readings.",

"I was the first one to get an Apple watch when it came out. Now, every one in my family has later models, and I am the one getting the hand-me-downs. It is an amazing product, but it will take a while for people to figure it out.",
"I've said elsewhere that the Series 3 represents the first step into the ""post-smartphone era"". The reality is that the iPhone and its imitators are already ""too good"", and constantly adding new features to already mature technology rapidly reaches a point of diminishing return. This means that the real innovation is no longer in your pocket/purse but in wearable technology like the Watch. Expect very rapid evolution in this form factor over the next few years, with Apple clearly in the lead.When they first launched the iPhone (and iPad) needed to be tethered to a desktop computer. Once they broke free they were able to really proliferate. The Series 3 is quasi-independent of the phone, but it still needs a tether. Once that tether is cut (Series 4 or 5 at the latest) the Watch can become its own independent platform and pull away. Watch owners already know what I'm talking about. Apple Pay is ridiculously easy with the watch. Navigation with wrist-tap cues for ""turn right / turn left"" is great, and the haptics mean your reminders always work. Once this technology gets paired with some sort of fashion eyewear there will simply be no need to carry an iPhone or other smartphone ever for most of the population.",
"DM - good stuff. As is normally the case with everything Apple does, the real ASPs and economic value of the AppleWatch is being understated and under-estimated. I bought my wife a Watch for Christmas. No LTE so price tag was about $350. But, I also added an upgraded band for $150. When the Apple rep told me what the price of the band was, I said 'you gotta be kidding me', and then said 'I'll take the blue one'. (and then I came home and bought another few shares ☺️). The point is that the band sales are not reflected in the Watch ASPs. But if I didn't buy the Watch, I obviously wouldn't have purchased the band. If 1 out of 3 Watches sold include an upgraded band, the 'real' ASP is 10-15% higher than the reported ASP. Beyond that, once you have a Watch, it's unlikely you'll balk at an extra hundred bucks or so when it comes time to upgrade your iPhone. This is just an amazing business. Fun to watch.",
"I have been in and out of Apple stock three or four times over the last six years. I have made a very substantial amount of money in doing so. However, truth be told, had I held Apple without selling it I would have made an even grater amount of money. That being said, I would love to get back into Apple again. But with all of these reputable analysts saying this bull market is getting a bit long, I am concerned about getting in at these current levels and holding it while the market goes through a serious 15% or 20% correction. At age 75, I am not thrilled with buying it now and possibly having to hold it for two or more years. So I find myself in a quandary. I love the company, its products, and love the stock, since it has been very good to me. But I am a bit fearful about stepping in at these levels and facing a sharp pull back. Thoughts?",

New reserves strenghtening will be possible.",
"Hey Deep Value,  interesting to see that you and Crickant are both from France :), you forgot to translate.A comment : Let the bloodbath begin...   I would argue that the bloodbath has already occurred.   So will Atlas keep on bleeding or can it recover ?  In the short term, no idea.  Believe the drop is overdone, but catching a falling knife can hurt.   Medium term ?  I believe so as this could prove as only be a bump in the road. Atlas is not going out of business.   They still have a niche and as per management, market is still hardening.    So prices should be going up.   Actually, this answers your question Deep Value, did they lower price in the past and the answer is No, prices have been increased for the last years. This being said, do they have to capital to write more ?   Well, they do have a quote-share treaty and their reinsurance partner can absorb the slack is per their comments on the conference call.They will get a lower AM Best rating which could typically results in loosing clients, however, commercial auto clients do not appear to be sensitive to this.Now the big question : what about the reserves ?  After seeing a second cockroach this year, can we imply that more problems are to come ?    Well, listening to the conference call was instructive.    Management mention that they booked as per actuarial valuation, last year and this year.   So why did they need to strengthen their reserves : basically, it cost them more for prior years 2013-2015 than they expected.  They did not try to come up with phony reasons.However, there is a silver lining :   their claim team did review all the claims still open for the pre 2016 years and they are coming up with a value which is less than the actuarial valuation.   We might get a nice surprise here as the claims develop.  And good point for management, we will be kept aware of how these claims are getting settled on a quarterly basis.   Also, the actuary did value their IBNR based on historical pattern.    From what I gather, they did change their writing starting in 2016, using predictive analytics, plus they are now settling (paying or contesting) their larger claims much faster which should cost them less.   But the actuarial reserve will not give them any credit for this until they get more experience data.   So we might get another nice surprise as these year develop.They also took a big hit (0.55/share) because taxes are now lower in the States.  Sometimes, accountant are a bit disconnected from reality as this is counterintuitive, no benefit from the future years but lets reduce the tax loss asset from prior year losses.     Interestingly, using the book value approach to value the shares would reduce your target because of this hit.  Add also to this that with the increase of interest rates projected for future years, insurers should benefit.Lastly, no bonus from management this year and these guy, as shareholders, did also suffer from this clip : they own 13% of the corporation. So we are offered a leading niche insurer at a  5.5 PE in an hardening market, with pretty good chances of nice surprises on the upside as their reserves develop.    I will buy a few shares around this level and more if it goes lower.",

I think you mentioned 300mm+ from real estate sales, which puts your p/e around 11-12.  I think you should be looking to sell rallies like this one.  The stores are still pretty empty, maybe that's why they're selling them. . .  It was a good call at $20, but this is Macy's.",
Better late than never - I'll put a toe in the water.,
Thanks C&C. Yes - you have been screaming and yelling about Macy’s since sub-$20. A fantastic (and well researched and documented) position on your forum.,
"Worth noting, IMHO, that M not alone in this category.  Bought M, TGT and BKE all around the same time when sky was falling.  Cashed out the gain in TGT, but still sitting on M and BKE, based on dividends and where they are now on a ten-year chart pattern.  WRT to the short position size, BKE surprises me even more.  Shorts had to eat the regular and special divvy in January that came to $2/share and stock trend looking pretty good for a long position now.  If M and BKE keep going up this has got to get painful for the shorts eventually.",
"I love Macy’s, do my shopping there often. However at this point I think the market will want to see some sustainability on the turnaround mid-term, so there might not be much upside left in the name at this point. They indicated strong YTD sales for January so the current price should have support here. Remaining on the sidelines until I get a better entry price given the increased volatility.",
What other stocks would you recommend that are mis priced and under valued besides M?,
"Here we go again... first the initial enthusiasm for what appears to be a wonderful opportunity mispriced by the market, then the obsession with daily treatises and detailed research and analysis, at the same time the deification of management, later the hope for a short squeeze to save the day, penultimately, the need for a buyout that will get everyone back to even, and finally the restructuring with its disappointment and mea culpus. Forgive me if I don't join you on this journey.",
"Thanks to my very good memory, I still know how I started out investing in 1999 as a college student: I had some decent amount of money saved and went to the bank to talk to an ""investment advisor"". He told me I should buy Tech Stocks because they were surely going to be very good investments for the ""New Economy"".Suffice to say, a couple years later I had lost 50% of my money and I furiously withdrew what was left in my account, paid off my college bills, and vowed to never ever trust a banker (""bankster"") again.From that point forward, I started reading financial literature,historical overviews, etc. Better to do your own research than rely on others, right?Anyhow, this lesson (and others along the way) helped me with my conviction that M was undervalued late last year, just as the author explained. I held through the downdraft at the end of 2017 knowing that Citi and the other ""banksters"" didn't know squat.And here we me are. Vindicated at last.",
"Options; M offers an extremely high option premiums on their weekly options.

"To the author.What do you think is a fair PE for Macy ?Glad you brought up the double digit growth for Macy online sales that others seem to forget.

Not the only reason to invest, but numerous great/good companies pay nice dividends.",
"enjoyed the article. I just started investing fairly recently, to me, the hardest part of value investing is finding the best price point for entry. I know that isn't really the over all idea, since buying Macy in the 23/24 range is (was)  still a great play. But getting in at 18/19 would be so much better. So far, I've made a few good value plays, but none of them did I get to point where I could say, I bought it near the bottom.",

M has gone through last 2 years of hell and did all the right things closing non performing stores and selling them to eliminate the carrying costs, hiring 2 top eBay execs for digital, the lists go on and on including exclusive deals with top brands made for Macy's only apparel..I believe they may top the RE sales forecast with the I.Magnin building in downtown San Francisco  I hear it's drawing lots of interest from developers it may bring 300 million alone it's 243,000 sq ft",
"The problem with M is understanding when it is actually value. I guess the dividend is something to appease you if it had gone lower, but then the possibility of a cut was there. Glad it’s working out, but fundamentally M isn’t a buy an forget, it’s got to be actively managed.",
I bought at $20 for a quick 30% gain. I’m out of the stock now because I’m not bullish long-term but it was common sense to buy < $20.,
"15% of the float of M was short as of Feb. 15, 2018!

As a former professional portfolio manager with numerous Lipper awards I too have been a table pounder on Macy”s in the high teens area.

"I agree, it doesn't matter which valuation metric you choose, Disney is cheaper than it's been in a very long time. The market doesn't seem to trust that Disney's earnings are going to be up over 20% this year, but they will be. It should be becoming harder to deny after the blowout they had in Q1 and now the runaway success of the 1st of 3 high profile Marvel movies of the year, yet the market still can't believe with media staying flat this can happen. Disney was going to have double digit organic growth this year without tax reform, but now those numbers will be closer to 23% ($7 vs $5.67 last year, plus that $1.02 one-time tax benefit they took in Q1).  That means at an historical multiple of 20x, Disney should end the year somewhere between $155 and $165 depending on where you think earnings will come in.  I'm not saying this is going to happen, in fact I doubt it will, but even at 17x earnings of $7.85 (which is conservative) you'd be at $133.The problem is the sentiment is very bad, and that won't change overnight.  Every share that weak hands sell to stronger hands though, reduces the number of shares available for sale in the future. Throughout this year earnings should continue to surprise to the upside because analysts are way too pessimistic and if/when that comes to fruition demand for the shares will accelerate, less supply will be available, and the share price can finally start to appreciate again. The key is to have a position before this starts to happen.  There is someone selling today with the stock down over $1.50, so there are clearly some very weak hands that still need to be washed out, but the progression continues.",

"My opinion, stay clear until DELL decides how they are going to deal with VMW.The market, by driving the price down then up, doesn't know, so, VMW is strictly a ""roll of the dice"" until the decision is common knowledge.Personally bought and sold.......no position!",
why would Dell be interested in destroying VMW value when Dell is majority owner of VMW? It does not make sense.,
VMware with their forecasted $3.3 billion free cash flow and a growth rate that is approaching 15%. Should not do any deal that values the company at less than $200 a share. At current prices Dell shareholders would be getting VMware at a mass discount,
I doubt Dell is trying to create impact on VMW.  That would be unlikely.1. Dell owns 82% of VMW or 84.5m Shares.2. Post earnings pop should have been at least 5%.  So from ~$130 to ~$137.3. Delta is now ~$137 to ~$116.  So delta is ~$21.4. Bottomline is that this VMW drop would have cost deal at least $1.8B Seems a odd Strategy when you already have such a huge stake and the biggest impact is on your own holdings,

Having the proceeds available as capital for expansion of the business would be a much more favorable scenario to justify early purchase of shares by retail investors.At this point WHD—with the author’s undervaluation estimate of 21%—appears attractive only as a speculation rather than an investment.",

"This is definitely not a buy for the long term. It may be good for swing trade or holding for a few months to ride the ""bullish"" retracements that follow the selloffs. TTM free cash flow (the real one, not the adjusted) has been declining since Q1 2016. It is currently negative. To get their adjusted free cash flow, the company adds back capital expenditures made towards their growth initiative and also some of their operating expenses. Anyone can check any of their MD&As to verify for themselves. Their long-running dividend payment and recent share buyback programs are not sustainable if things doesn't change for their net income. And there is little hope for that given all the major headwinds facing them in the coming quarters.After their shares fell in Aug 2017, they announced share buybacks, and this was the reason they gave in their press release: ""Cineplex has concluded that the market price of Cineplex's common shares, from time to time, may not reflect the inherent value of the company and purchases of common shares pursuant to the bid may represent an appropriate and desirable use of funds.""This is a management that cares a lot about their stock price, which is good, but bad when they do it at the expense of the company's debt burden.Open their Q3 2017 MD&A, and check why they tapped more debt from their revolving credit facility in Sept 2017; $75 million to be precise. Here to make it easy; verbatim from the MD&A: ""The purpose of the increase in the Revolving Facility will be to fund new acquisitions, capital expenditures and the normal course issuer bid.""  (Normal course issuer bid is the technical name for share buyback).Virtually all their cash from operations goes toward paying dividends. They are relying heavily on debt to fund their diversification effort and share buybacks. Oh, and most of their debt (83%) have variable interest rates, and interest rates are going up.I definitely should write an article that does a real deep dive into the financials of Cineplex.",

"Why must INTC sell the NAND to another company for them to resell in China.?No reason whatsoever.Except for when China requires quotas of the amount of NAND that can be imported.This strong arms every manufacture into building facilities in China. Thus , forcing the supply chain to move to China. Once the supply chain and manufacturers are in China, it will control the supply of NAND. Thus eroding margins and placing the nonconformist memory makers out of business.",
"What is the news here? With the announcement of the Dalian fab at the end of 2015, we have known that Intel has intentions of selling NAND in the Chinese market. Why else would you build a fab in China? This was an interesting development 27 months ago, but nothing has changed since then.",
@AuthorTwo things:1. I don’t clearly understand is what kind of IP does Intel have when compared to the other memory makers?2. Do they have to license anything to make this happen?Thank you!,
Not sure why everyone dumps on Intel. I have more than doubled my money and my yield on book is approaching 5%. Reminds me of a few years ago with everyone hating MSFT. Apparently I was naïve in backing up the truck and the comments in SA really hurt. My only comfort is my 166% capital gain. Intel will do just fine. Last year it was the miniscule AMD who were going to eat them alive. AMD has been forecast to do that since 1990.,

""YMTC and UNIC cannot immediately cut into the middle- and high-end smartphone markets or become competitive in client SSD sector, their products are likely to be adopted by Chromebooks or other consumer electronics, which may influence the overall prices trend of NAND flash in the future"". Sounds like it will be a couple years before they can even start competing with Samsung, Hynix and MU in any meaningful way.",

"Intel never makes money or wins on these arrangements. This one will also likely follow the same story: partner develops some token product with Intel parts, Intel teaches the partner on their technology and manufacturing, the token product based on the Intel components fails in China, the partnership is dissolved. The partner company in China wins by getting the Intel technology process for their own use, and Intel loses because nothing is gained on their side. This is like watching the groundhog day movie over and over. All these types of deals ever do is improve Chinese manufacturing capability to the detriment of all others..",
China generally requires foreign companies manufacturing inside China to turn over all IP.  Does anyone know what IP Intel uses inside China?  It should be older IP already known to Chinese manufacturers.,

Intel or nvidia,
"NVidia is literally in the best position possible, people are lining up to pay msrp+20-80% extra at them for their 2-year old product that they are basically done producing now, they're essentially flushing out inventory now or soon will be. They will have close to zero unsold inventory. Can you believe that? amd still has fx chips for sale online, lol. Then in a month or two (my guess is end of this month) they drop the new cards (that they've been steadily building up stock of and are mass producing as we speak) and everyone rushes out to go upgrade to 20XX. High end gpu is the new mainstream, people that weren't traditional gpu buyers before now just want to drive big displays. Crypto. Data centers where gpu and parallel processing are becoming more important, hence EPYC having a shot in hell of penetrating some server market share. AI. Drive platform which every big car maker is on. Anyways, back to GPUs nvidia is going to own the market this year and till Navi. Apple is taking all your gpu dies and paying amd peanut margins. Amd is awesome their products are great and I'll always be a fan, but the stock is a joke. Long NVDA because of CUDA and JenHsuns leadership. They aren't afraid to play dirty and they're already a few years ahead of everyone else. They aren't slowing down either.",
"What is keeping NVDA down last month or so? Even INTC is up 20% compared to it. There is selling pressure every day, including today.",
"Anyone have thoughts on this?  How big of a deal is it?  And why is Nvidia going to such lengths when its GPUs are better than AMD's anyway and it's selling all it can make?  If it wants to put AMD in its dust, why not release the new gaming GPU and charge $1200-1500 for it like many sites are saying it can?So far, I'm not that worried about illegality... it sounds like the gist of it is that partners can sell products using GPUs from people other than Nvidia, and they can market them as gaming products, but they have to have a gaming brand exclusive to Nvidia.  That doesn't sound illegal to me.  There would probably be a problem if anyone could provide evidence about these alleged dark warnings that those who don't favor Nvidia will have trouble getting inventory from it...  The legal issues worry me less than the image ones.http://bit.ly/2DaFzYM",
Have you read a news report yesterday (or could be a day before) about UBER self-driving truck operation in the state of Arizona since late 2017?

"When the new NVidia GPUs are released, whenever that may be, NVDA will be 300 in short order . They are absolutely dominating some of the hottest fields in semis and tech with zero competition on the horizon near to medium term, and some of the best engineers in the world with more than sufficient r&d spend. I'd like to know how a small ten billion dollar company like AMD is supposed to compete with two giants like intel and nvidia. They can't. So please stop acting like anything AMD does is at all relevant. The competition is over. NVidia has a long, long runway all to themselves. Intel will probably spend the next 2-3 years and hundreds of millions trying to reverse engineer gpu IP with my boy Raja,, only to blow it all up and go back to licensing, or put out a subpar product line that NVidia trounces anyways. Ditto for amd in GPUs. The green team is just too far ahead at this point. Not that I'm complaining. Long NVidia",
"NVDA 's slow play is almost as annoying as INTC. When your competition falls flat - like Vega did, bring unable to unseat Pascal , you pound them that much harder, and release an even better product.  you don't delay like Intc snd offer  AMD the chance to come up with  a (relative) winner like Threadripper. I suspect the traditional, non Crypto TAM is doing just fine for NVDA, but the vaguery around where the units are going , indeed, does let AMD have it both ways in the media .",
"Mark,I agree that both AMD and Nvidia have become somewhat dependent on the windfall from crypto. That windfall may disappear overnight leaving both companies scrambling. Comes down to which company was the least responsible for cheesing off their gaming community through the shortages. That Nvidia has no refresh this time around is not surprising as they've reached the point where design cycles have been stretched to the limit and returns from going to ever smaller geometries are flatlining.  One other thing you might want to look into is what Intel is doing with their Xeon Phi imbroglio. They've been mum since last November - the buzz circuit says this may be about to change and Nvidia's Cloud return with it...,No charge for the tip...,-Growlzler",
"I'm currently long AMD, but I have been looking at NVDA too, my concern is that I may have missed the train, as the shares are getting up to $250.  I was thinking of getting in at the pull back in December, but thought I would hold off until CES.NVDA is in a great spot.  It commands the ""elite"" graphics cards segment that gamers must have (1080Ti) and makes a ton of money on that.  While AMD is still a great value option for many gamers, value does tend to mean smaller margins for profit for the company.  NVDA is also more present in the autonomous car world, and as the old saying goes, you gotta be in it to win it.The other reason I say NVDA is in a great spot is regarding crypto mining.  As if they weren't making enough money before, now they claim GPU prices will be inflated until the end of this year due to cryptomining demand.  Although AMD GPUs have been much better at mining Ethereum, nVidia's GTX series does well with other types of coins.  As the author has stated, if it's 60/40 split now, a lot of the 40 is coming from people who can't get the AMD GPU and would rather make something now than wait for AMD to meet supply.  With AMD's lack of supply, it has opened a back door to NVDA mining and more and more people are realizing that it's still profitable, but might take 1 month extra maybe.Great article, strongly agree with their upcoming tech show being a boost for the stock.  Although I've heard rumors about the next Turin/Ampere GPUs not being at the show, I don't consider it a major blow to the company.  After all, if they can charge more for the same technology they have been building for 2 years now, that means more revenue and less R&D cost.  Delay the newest stuff until it's required, and they will be ready.",
EPYC server deployment accelerating at Packet datacenter http://bit.ly/2t3lxzE,
"Reading rumors that ampere is delayed.  Not sure if they mean because it was expected now, or delayed even beyond July eta.Maybe they are waiting for 7nm.  Frankly doesn’t make much sense to release on 12nm unless it’s coming out immediately.Except that amd will have 7nm Vega instinct later this year so nvidia needs to step on the gas to remain competitive.",
anyone can explain the huge number Puts bought for March and April. I assume it has to do with AMDs game console business. Any other thought would be appreciated.,
"1) most popular mining card are RX 580 for 29mh/s or GTX 1060 for 24mh/s.  the TOM list include RX550 or GTX1050 which is far less used in mining. Average mh/s per card should be near to 25 mh/s than 20mh/s.2) AMD cards generally are priced at higher premium at retail than nVidia card.  This drive away gamers. Cards like Vega are priced over 100% over MSRP and there's no way gamers buying these cards.  At least part of the nVidia gaming card are sold to gamers who indeed prefer AMD card.  Hence if mining crush, nVidia will lose gaming card sales on top of mining cards while AMD drop in mining card sales will be partially offset by gamer demand",
"Mark, thanks for the article.  I don't quite understand how sticking with Pascal for a while entails sacrificing market share.  You said:""The downside of the strategy appears to be that it opens the door to AMD to make further gains as it did in calendar Q4, as recently reported by Jon Peddie research. Although there was a sequential decline in Q4, total desktop add-in board sales were still a healthy 15.54 million.""What I keep coming back to is that if AMD and Nvidia are both selling every GPU they can make, which seems to be the case, the only way for AMD to gain significant market share is to make more GPUs relative to Nvidia than before, and this data backs that up.  Nvidia's GPU shipments declined noticeably, while in many past Q4s they've increased sequentially, and AMD's shipments simultaneously increased.So it looks like the decision to stick with Pascal is not the reason for the loss of market share, it's the decision to make less of it just as AMD was increasing their supply.  Why should sticking with Pascal lead to making less of it?  What could cause Nvidia's shipments to decline while allowing AMD's to increase?",
AMD caught NVDA flat footed and captured 6% market share in the 4th Qtr.. through the supply deal with INTC for discrete GPUs.. Brilliant move!! Now NVDA is late on delivering the next batch of GPUs while AMD is just ramping up their supply chain when stable GF doing a good job of keeping up with demand.. this market drop was just another opportunity to BFD! Backing up the truck all the way down to $10 if need be.. but only see it testing $11.20s if at all and then going back up to test $12.90-$13.15 next week..,
"NVDA's strategy is a good one just look at how well AMD stock has fared the last year compared to NVDA. I still don't see AMD as a serious competitor and not sure if they ever will be, I bought even more NVDA shares this morning. I admit I offloaded my JD at a loss but gained all my money back since NVDA did a great reversal today.",
"mark I love the back handed comment about AMD.  ""And even Ryzen APUs that include Vega graphics will be fabricated only on 14 nm this year. Thus, the lack of new competition from AMD also seems to mandate a go slow approach to a Pascal successor.""the whole point of the new amd Apu is for marketing and pulling share away from NVDA ( those little NVDA stickers on laptops go a long way). this is also the same reason AMD is selling Vega chips to their arch nemesis INTC,  to gain market share buy having more stickers on the laptops.    It's genius if you think about it, change the tide for the next 3 years against NVDA in the grafphics market place.   oh yeah also add Eypc server chips with Vega intergrated.

"Thanks for the thorough write up. I have been in this stock for a long time and painfully experienced the rise and collapse. Still think there was hedge fund shenanigans going on as it tanked to $1.30. The CEO never sold shares as it went to $15+ while the CFO consistently sells off small chunks. He did that on the way to $15. Insiders did not buy either when it hit lows. Puzzling. My guess on the S3 is they want the market to fund them if the stock price gets out of hand. What that price is is the big question. Total revenue growth has been unimpressive considering the Exony revs. I have been waiting for this to change, as $15M/Q in such a large space is peanuts. Yet they still call themselves ""the leading provider..."" In the latest investor conference the CFO mentioned them looking from the 300 seat level and up to maybe down to the 100 seat level.

KHC got as low as $66.36 over the last 2 days and I wish I could have gotten them that low on Tuesday. However, KHC goes Ex Dividend on March 8th, sports a 3.75% Yield, and has a Trailing P/E of 7.5.

I dunno if it’s time to buy quite yet but I’m watching both KHC and CPB closely,
"It is true that KHC has a current RSI of about 30, but all that indicates is that there are more determined sellers than buyers.  That doesn't mean that the shares are a buy at these levels.  I think that the purchase of Kraft by 3G with the assistance of Berkshire's cash imputed a higher expected price for the shares than they actually deserved.  Now a few years later, buyers of the shares have begun to realize that the price paid may have diverged significantly from the value of the combined company's assets under 3G management. I held Kraft when the buy out occured and sold my KHC not long after, not understanding the rapid rise in the market price.  The fact that the shares are now selling at a 52 weak low compared to prices above $90, does not in any way mean that now is a great time to buy them.  I see little reason to buy the shares at prices above $55.  I understand that I may never get them at such a price, but believe that 3G has not shown results that would make me pay more.",

"Does Buffet still own it? If so, is he buying more shares or selling?",
I rater to invest CPB because 2 things. 1) buy out target 2) oversold has very strong financial to support dividend and stock repurchase. 3) good dividend yield,
Thanks for sharing your analysis and view.  I think mean reversion may act on KHC stock in near future as P/E is way less than competitors.I have no clue whether in next 52 weeks it will achieve a year earlier price range but I feel that there is a strong chance to gain some momentum due to very low P/E now and bring the P/E to 10 in a quarter time.  Fingers crossed as I hold few shares near 52 week low price now :-),

Been with OLED a long time since $8 as my first purchase.  Listened to the call which I bet 99% of those who sold did not. Professionals don't listen.  Short term game for them.  The call outlined new fabs coming on in '19 and possibly more demand in the back half of '18.  They have visibility from some pull forward sales first half of '18 so that will be slower growth.  Most companies don't go straight up with growth every single quarter.  Things ebb and flow.  The first half of '18 will be slower but management sounds extremely confident the entire industry and growth estimates are intact.I remain long and will add at these lower levels.  This is a 3 to 5 year play IF MicroLED takes off.  Possibly longer depending on that success and what OLED advances also happen during that time.  If MicroLED cannot compete this is a 5 to 10 year play maybe longer.  The only threat whatsoever is MicroLED.  Currently not in production. Not commercialized.  Should Samsung abandon it and go OLED with QLED hybrid as rumors say that would be a death blow to MicroLED.  Then you have clear runway for a very long time on OLED.,
"The CEO should not be allowed to talk to analysts, he doesn’t understand that anything negative is all they hear. OLED has a very high P/E and any negative talk means the stock is not worth the high price. Being negative is a self fulfilling proficiency, and people will next question whether the high price of their screens is justified.",

"One other factor pointing towards a reverse merger with VMW.  The WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play event is happening in Austin, Texas this week as we speak.  Michael Dell typically does the big on camera TV interviews at this event and schmoozes clients.  He's not doing interviews at the tourney this year, as he did last year.  It might mean nothing but....",
I suggest those interested in DVMT read this article which does cover all the tax aspects of the possible outcomes in some detail; https://seekingalpha.c...,
"So with all that said, how is it that DVMT and VMW are not trading at parity? we can assume that markets are efficient, so what does the discount of DVMT to VMW telling us?",
"For some reason, people seem to believe that DVMT = Dell Holding (aka Denali) company.  It doesn't.  It's a tracking stock given to EMC shareholders at the time of the merger with Denali to represent EMC's holding in VMW.  Theoretically, DVMT and VMW are meant to trade 1 for 1.  There are reasons that they don't trade at parity today, but a merger or reverse merger could cure it.  As such, in a Dell Holding Company (Denali) reverse merger with VMW, it's possible that VMW goes down and DVMT goes up.",
"The way I see it is that the bottom line is that no one knows exactly what the deal, if a deal is going to be struck, will look like AND the outcome will almost for sure be positive for VMW shareholders no matter what. The ones who buy in this week on weakness will make at least a 20% return within a 30 day period on a great company.",
Why not just sell Pivotal to VMW.,
"Is it possible that Michael Dell & VMW are currently buying shares cheaper in the open market? and that's why Dell filled the Schedule 13D, knowing that it would make the price drop.",
"I feel whichever option Mr. Dell likes to propose to the world, it is premature, it is as simple as that. VMW's mostly longstanding loyal shareholders don't want to see yet another ""steal"" orchestrated by Mr. Dell and Silver Lake, so they're being extremely suspicious of ANY & ALL of Mr. Dell's intentions.If he can concentrate on bringing DELL/EMC merger to its full promise, and start to share market share gains, revenue growth, EBITDA growth and especially, more wins at events like CEO for innovation, these VMW shareholders would slowly begin to believe in his intentions.Instead, his current plans only smack of plain, old manipulation to yet again, ""steal"" from public shareholders, and it would be a particular pity that great folks like VMW CEO Pat Gelsinger are shortchanged in the process, along with minority shareholders, employees, and of course, its loyal customers worldwide.",
"You left off that Dell Client business gets paid in about 8 days and pays net 30 for PC components, so they turn their component inventory about 4 times before they ever pay for the first component.  Just Wall Street analysts don't get that model.Second good thing about your proposal is they would have a pure software play and a pure hardware play instead of mixing them up like it is today.",
"DVMT was given to EMC shareholders as a proxy for the VMW holdings.  With Elliott Management, Third Point, Dodge & Cox and Farallon as large holders, i don't think Denali can do much to steal value from DVMT holders.",
At the end of the day he will face a slew of resistance and class action suits from VMW minority shareholders.,
Mike Dell is pimping on VMWare.,
"One thing that should be abundantly clear to everyone is that Michael Dell is greedy. Am not sure how smart he is. He likes to think of himself as another Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, but comes up a little short here. He is mostly an operator using everyone else's money, until it becomes his money.",
"Michael Dell (MSD) didn't have the incentive to care about the public market shareholders as he was going private.  And he didn't have to think about EMC or VMW shareholders first, when he merged with those entities.If the goal of this proposed transaction is to gain control of the VMW cash flows, to de-lever Dell HoldCo and return to the public markets, MSD's motivations have to change or he doesn't create the value he needs.so what's his motivation for doing this all now?  is the tax law changes that limit his ability deduct interest expense given his debt load?  if so, then i think he has to treat DVMT shareholders honorably - not to mention he's been selling VMW stock to VMW and using the proceeds to buyback DVMT stock.  He's telling you the arb has to close and as the largest shareholder of DVMT - he cares.perhaps this is all naive but it seems to foot with everyone's motivations.",
Where did you get the data on Pivotal? 7B valuation seems exaggerated given the reported revenue of ~300M/year and growth rate.,

"Well, I must admit, I do get a little emotional when it comes to DMD. But, I don’t generally disagree with your approach as being analytically stringent. In fact, I am very analytical myself, so I can appreciate that human quality. Bottom line is my point that FDASIA created new standards for approval re: drugs for rare diseases, and so many are unwilling to accept this due to their embrace of mathematical rigor in trial design, generally a noble endeavor. Farkus_MD even left the FDA over this point of contention. But, the reason for FDASIA was simple: children are dying while we work towards approval. When a treatment has been proven safe and evidence of efficacy exists, why not allow the family to assume the risk of trying the drug? Who cares if it’s expensive? If it were not expensive, there would never be another one. No company is gonna bring a drug to market for a few thousand patients and price it as if it were Lipitor. Companies such as Sarepta generally assume 100% of the copay and patients have no out-of-pocket costs. So, if my insurance rates go up a little to help incentivize more drugs for rare diseases, I am ok with that. In the case of eteplirsen, 10 of 12 kids are still “walking”. The only two who are not walking failed almost immediately after starting the trial, which seems to imply that the drug was delivered too late. So, some common sense is required here. If you google DMD and take a look at patient videos, you will see my point. Forgive me for being a little too emotional and thank you for being a gentleman. —thlizrd🦎",
"Damn. Talk about not being able to see the forest because of the trees! Ten of twelve DMD kids from these trials are STILL WALKING six years into treatment. This doesn't happen in untreated DMD kids. You say, ""since there is no approved alternative, there is nothing available for comparison"". Wrong. Go meet the family of a DMD kid in his 20's and you will find your comparison. Educated idiots like you have been detractors from the very beginning. And, if left unchecked, these kids would still be dying slowly. As it stands, however, they are stabilizing and even improving on treatment. Finally, please do us all a favor and go read FDASIA. The US congress passed this law as a ""direct order"" (not a suggestion) that latitude be given in trials of rare diseases where numbers are low, efficacy is ill-defined, and measures of efficacy are questionable. But, you can't teach an old dog new tricks. GET THIS THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL: The game has changed and we will no longer let our children suffer and die in order to appease some anal-retentive p-value professor. 'Nuff said. ---thlizrd",
"Ignored skeptics for years because Duchenne parents said Exondys made a real difference.  Yet bean counters insisted it didn’t because it didn’t meet their trial specifications with blinded kids receiving placebo.  Hoping the CATB can skip Phase III too, as dying kids don’t need more bureaucratic hurdles to better health, less pain and agony, and prolonged lives",
"For the skeptics.

"Any word on that confirmatory phase 3 trial for Exondys 51 that the FDA required on approval? Is there any data which shows that this drug is actually effective in the expanded population? To this point Sarepta has only given phase 2 clinical data on 12 patients. Or are they just raking in the dough now and nobody cares? This drug was not much more effective than Drisapersen in clinical trials.(And remember that the FDA deemed Drisapersen unworthy of approval). Exondys 51, then called Eteplirsen, simply lacked the ISR issues that Drisapersen had. They both had about the same antisense efficacy. Eteplirsen hit its target 5% of the time while Drisapersen hits it 4% of the time. Also, it is my understanding that this drug costs about $300,000 per year. With only 500 prospective patients for this drug, that caps the revenues from Exondys 51 at $150,000,000. Where are all the other revenues coming from?",

"This all comes down to revenue growth.  I think the decline in revenue growth has been more than priced in.  The closer we get to the quarter when revenue on an absolute YoY basis returns the stock price will increase and rapidly.   Some LT people like myself are in and sitting on LT Capital gains when that happens, other traders will be in and out and try to time it.  Given the discrepancy in LT vs ST tax rates I can be patient.   Nice to see upgrades coming as well as the lower PTs being lifted.  While there may be some disagreement on where the turnaround is among the analyst community, the end of days scenario seems to be off the table.   I’m sure potential acquirers have come to that same conclusion and pieces of this business look excessively cheap to them especially at the high levels their stocks are trading at.

Thanks",
"The article does not address the central problem.  Unlike larger traditional pharmaceutical companies VRX assumed it could buy growth, often in the form of older products whose prices could then be raised dramatically, rather than developing products internally. That game is over. Good new acquisitions are expensive and competitive and the old acquisition strategy became a scandal. So while over any given year we can argue about about EBITDA moving 5% either way , in a dynamic field it is inevitable that VRX' portfolio will be subject to episodic new competition which will take market share and erode pricing. Meanwhile , VRX is a CCC+  credit with debt to EBITDA of 7-8x  in a dynamic industry. The equity is so highly levered that a 50% change either way moves the EV/EBITDA by less than 1x , so in the short run the stock could be a hot craps table ; but it is hard to see how this ends well several years down the road, especially if we are in a rising interest rate cycle.",

VRX management issued conservative guidance which it will likely beat every quarter in 2018.  Papa's conservative approach to annual guidance has worked to pull VRX previously out of its historical lows in 2017.

"Hi Warwick,Thanks for your analysis! You’ve done great work. I think several people had pointed out on a few occasions that your estimates were a bit on the optimistic side.I was not as surprised as you with 2018 guidance. I sold 20% of my shares at $22.50 mainly to balance my portfolio (VRX became 40%!).When it dropped to $18, I was hesitant to but back as I was expecting very conservative guidance due to the LOEs. I knew after having dropped from 22 to 18, this could spook Mr. Market. And so I now have the opportunity to buy back those shares maybe even below my average price of $13.50The only thing in the guidance that I hadn’t foreseen is the extra costs that will come with promoting the new and existing products to foster the future growth. This will reduce short term profitability. But it is of course beneficial to my long term investment thesis!Never underestimate sentiment in the market, so I will be patient and wait until below $13 to buy the shares that I sold at $22.5 back.Price is what you pay, value is what you get.",
"I would suggest that before you get too upset over the downward revision in EBITDA guidance for this year that you consider two points:  1. This CFO treats LOEs as a cliff and makes his projection on the conservative basis that all revenue is lost on the LOE date, when in fact it isn’t, which allowed Valeant to beat several quarters last year and 2. Valeant is investing in salespeople this year for new products which will decrease EBITDA this year, but help it in future years.",

"Warwick:Please explain how a 6% difference on 2018 EBITDA ($3.2B vs your $3.4B) equates to a 33% decline in your top end of fair value (from $60 to $40).  The EBITDA delta is $.57 per share versus a fair value delta of $20 per share.  That's quite a hefty incremental EPS multiple of 35.  Is there more to the story, like lower EBITDA extrapolation into the future?PS - I would still be happy if VRX drives anywhere close to $40.  I will no longer be a shareholder by then.",

But there are aspects of this ER which, when I read it, point to some corporate sleight of hand. Gonna read it again, more closely, over the weekend - maybe I'm missing something or going through it again will make things clearer.Right now I'm glad I sold off over 50% between $18.50 and $23 in December & January. Still own a fair amount and still think it will go up. But in particular, some of the B&L and Salix ""organic"" vs ""actual"" growth numbers bother me.

"Are investors realizing that Paul's guidance includes LOE's for Apriso and Uceris, both of these drugs represent about 19% of Salix's revenue. It would seem a Paul went a little overboard with a conservative guidance, especially when neither drugs have a NDA filing from a competing pharmaceutical company to make a generic. I'm still very optimistic that in the coming quarters that Paul will have to raise guidance because he sand bagged it so much. Let's not forget Vyzulta and Siliq are continuing to experience exponential sales numbers as time moves on. I'm still long Valeant and will buy more if hits my target number of $13. Since the market reacted so terribly to Q4 and guidance I have a feeling Q1 will not be much different.",
"Warwick, go back and read my posts about unsold Valeant drugs that channel players got stuck holding the bag on.  It was alarming to see, they will not be fooled again... like I said, there was material revenue from previous quarters that were 'phantom' revenue because there were never scripts for them and the channel players ate the cost.  Now do you see why your projection was off?",
"Thank you for analysis. But what are LOE’s. Sorry I am nota financial guy, still learning!",
I don't understand your complains. You should ahve updated your numbers after they lost their Apriso and Uceris lawsuits. Uceris and Apriso will still be difficult to copy and generic versions might not be as effective as brand name versions.,
"If Valeant can fetch $10bn or more for Salix, then they should sell it now to de-risk the company. Salix is about 20% of revenue. And their debt stack would be solved until 2023. If you sell Salix the remaining business has about $2bn in Ebitda(which is excessively conservative). The multiple would be at least 12 EV/EBITDA with B&L making up over 80% of it. $2bn EBITDA x 12 = 24bn - $15bn debt = $9bn market cap = $26 a share. Since the upside is now more limited it makes more sense as a way to de-risk. As derm and B&L growth, the stock price will grow into the $40s and 50s within a couple years.",

Lower lows keep on coming.   VRX is not close to out of the woods,
Mgmt is being overly cautious due to some products losing exclusivities as well as new product launches.  Likely they will revise and increase their guidance at Q1/Q2 earnings release.,
I think it will take a few months 3-6 + good news to get back to 20$,
The fx numberrs make no sense to me?  Unless they hedged their currency exposure so it will produce higher revenue but have a hedging loss?  Longer term the fx gains eventually flow into profits as hedges expire but as I predict the dollar is in a mini bear market.  But yes how does fx add 150 in revenue but subtracts 50 in profits.  I don't know the amount of their costs that are in fx but i'd assume 150 million revenue gain would lead to higher profits of 50-100 million,

"Jason,Thanks for a solid analysis on SNR.  I think most investors will agree that the market has been undervaluing the true market value of SNR's properties.  However, with that said, as John and Michael both point out, one of the main problems has been the high outside management fees by Fortress.  I believe that SNR would not have been put up for sale W/O the approval of Fortress, so the real question comes regarding their willingness to either eliminate/reduce their fees, or to take a ""one time exit fee"".  That would certainly affect the final price an acquirer would pay.As you pointed out, a PE firm or an internally managed REIT could buy SNR, restructure the debt (refi and get variable debt at a fixed rate), and earn a decent return - especially if the Fortress high fees could be eliminated.I have never met current management, but have been somewhat ""under whelmed"" in listening to them on various CC's.

Fortress is trying to get liquid on all its old portfolio after the Softbank acquisition because they have over $100 Billion to spend now and bigger fish to fry.  I think a higher price would come from another internally managed REIT, however, which could eliminate the onerous management fees of Fortress (which are structured like a hedge fund fee) and apply a cap rate to an improved cash flow, as well as provide better management for the portfolio (the current management team does not inspire confidence).

"Jason:Does your estimated free cash flow number and takeout value include Fortress Group's very high management fees.  If those fees are excluded going forward, free cash flow would increase and so would the possible takeout price.  The key is will Fortress give up the fees or extract a large one time ""exit fee"" for giving up its management contract?. Left to its own devices, I would say no, but with Softbank acquiring Fortress perhaps Softbank has other things in mind and wants to simplify the Fortress portfolio and focus on other areas.",Why A Sale At $10 Or More Makes The Most Sense For New Senior Investment Group's Shareholders

A convertible preferred wouldn’t be the end of the world but anything to increase their debt leverage would be very bad. However, they also mentioned being very aware of their cost of capital and being disciplined. Let’s see how those two conflicting things resolve themselves. As someone who’s mainly bullish via sold puts, a convertible preferred might be ok because I don’t care about giving away upside to the stock. However, the best course of action for Unit is slow deleveraging via any available cash flow. Buying back bonds in the open market is a risk free 10% yield.

"i really think this argument is about the demand for fiber optic cable over the next 5-10 years.  if the demand is there, uniti will be able to maintain its distribution over that time (including interest rate increases and default from win).  The price of uniti may not increase back into the 20’s unless win shows a clear path to viability. The key for me is that i own uniti at a fairly low cost basis (16) so i can afford to wait.",
"All this talk about Windstream filing bankruptcy, and that being the best path, is rubbish. Tony Thomas stated, at the February 26, 2018 Morgan Stanley conference (listen to the last minute of it) that when he took over as CEO, ""to say that we lacked optimism was probably an understatement"".  The company is far beyond that now, the situation improving by the day. They are not going to file bankruptcy. WIN stock price is actually lower now, than it was then. We can already see the light at the end of Windstream tunnel (for reasons I stated above), but the price does not reflect it. This is a rare opportunity, and the reason I am piling as much as I can into Windstream. Tony Thomas interview link: http://bit.ly/2FdAHns",
"Given their current Price-Point, I do not see that UNIT will go down much. In fact, looking at the Charts, it's likely they will pull up above 15 on Monday.The ER is what the Investors look at. The 'Credit Downgrade' is based entirely on the perspective of debt alone, and the Moody's report has just as much importance as a report in the News Media. They pick on companies who are in a tough situation, and make them look worse than they are. But will prop-up ratings for other companies who might not have a good business, just because they have little or no company debt. Bias more or less.In my experience, you have to manage Risk, no matter what you are trading or investing in. UNIT is one of those you don't simple just 'Buy & Hold': You pay Attention to the PR, ER, and keep up with the Charts.UNIT is going through what Thousands of companies have gone through in the past. Many of those which are considered 'Blue-Chips' Today.UNIT might be in a tight-spot right now, but they will find a way to make it work.And the ER shows they are making gradual Progress.The Issue with putting so much emphasis on credit rating alone, is that you are putting your trust in one entity's Opinion, which is based on only one Aspect of a company.Much like some who believe that a Toyota Prius is the best car on the road based on MPG alone. The Strength in UNIT is that they are slowly showing that they can recover.To Quote Warren Buffet: ""The Stock Market is a mechanism which transfers money from the Impatient to the Patient""",
"From experience, and most experience comes from bad things happening to you, when you hear bad news, 80% of the time things are worse than reported. Moodys does not like to downgrade their clients. Moodys has access to more information than investors. As an investor I have no crying need to hold a company with hair on it. There are better places for my money. Instead of hanging in, I sold and bought Salesforce which then blew past earnings estimates. Why hold a company with the wind in its face when you can own one with the wind at their backs? Betting on the turnaround of a damaged company is like the expression ""We are born dirty, wet and naked....then things get worse.""",
"Author, be interesting see an article from you on CTL (Centurylink) in light of the recent Level 3 acquisition.",
An excellent discussion/debate raging here. The discussions that follow the articles are what makes SA especially entertaining and informative!,
"I would say it’s constructive discussion more than bickering but in the end it makes it much easier to see the bigger picture by comparing the two sides of the coin. For those advocating for Win BK , well if that was an easy option I’m sure Win would have taken that route already. Perhaps Win thinks they can come back without a restructuring. What bothers me however, is shorts writing articles spreading fear through obscure and marginal points of view to make a quick buck on the backs of other investors not aware of this practice. And yes I really don’t care I call it as I see it. I enjoy well balanced articles accentuating both sides of the coin which is fine, but so many times I see such negative articles basically just to push share prices  down for a quick buck.",
"Personally, I thought this was a very good discussion. The back-and-forth turned up new facts and points of view I hadn't considered.  And compared to other threads, not too much childishness. I bought UNIT in January as a high-risk play (small position), this article raised some interesting points, but the discussion brought out mitigating facts that I was unaware of.I have about 5 extreme high-yield stocks like this, all higher risk, representing 6% of my holdings.  I can't just dump them on one article.  It is the ""bickering"" that I read these articles for.",
I added a bit to my position today  at 14.70.    I think this all works out over the next 12-18 months.  I drip the dividends inside my IRA and will continue to nibble at prices below 15.  I saw nothing in the latest quarterly to change my strategy.  Good luck all,
will have to look at this,
No need for everyone to bicker and look childish. Present your view and thats it. We will see how it plays out in the next couple of years. I feel UNIT will surprise to the upside thru innovation and the stock price will rise.,
A win reorganization is best thing for unit.,
"On the call, growth plans were discussed, using PIPE financings of preferred or debt with an equity kicker or other alternatives. Since there is no transaction which now requires that financing, making further details public is not sensible and it was entirely reasonable of management not to have done so. Moreover the new sale/leaseback transaction is a step forward, and even without that pro forma transaction UNIT will be about 33% non-WIN leasing, with further distance from WIN when additional deals are done, bringing UNIT closer to its 50% third party leasing goal.   And if WIN ever did go into chapter 11 that would be a benefit, not a detriment, for UNIT. WIN's current equity would be largely or entirely wiped out or given to current creditors in exchange for the significant haircut they would have to take, new money would come in and UNIT would have a much more credit worthy tenant. And in the meantime, WIN's rent to UNIT is more than amply covered (close to 3x) so UNIT's dividend is safe.   Elliot Miller",
“No clear catalyst is present in the medium term”What?  That is just bizarre thinking.  I can think of multiple potent & likely catalysts.  Both companies gave strong reports that have me considering additional buys.  The noise-to-signal ratio at SA is getting unbearable.,
"Michael, nice article, you raise some solid points.  (great comment thread here also) I personally am long w/UNIT, I am willing to DRIP and wait, but it is a small position. There are definite risks here.",
I think WIN is on borrowed time but it won’t matter. A BK of WIN will resolve this once and for all. I’m long in UNIT. UNIT has plans to diversify away from WIN and is executing well. It will be a rough couple of years but I’m willing to wait.,
Unit still have all that dark fiber?,

"I wrote an article a few days after yours suggesting that a dividend cut was the only way to actually convince ""would be investors"" and financial institutions to finance UNITI through what you call somewhat opaque deals (out of the market transactions) but lost faith in Uniti's mngm when they reiterated their dividend policy. I cannot understand their financial strategy (a turnaround in sentiment? Really? From heaven?) except by assuming they are gambling on their masterlease holding in courts etc. I do not lend my money to gamblers.",

"I'm in agreement with the sentiments in the article, with the one difference of opinion being that the Aurelius/WIN IS a short (maybe medium) term catalyst.  IIRC UNIT was trending upwards before Aurelius started this whole nonsense (I think it peaked in the $18's), and I think it will resume doing so once this legal overhang is resolved.  Hopefully it will appreciate enough to become a viable means of funding growth again, but it does appear to be the major factor here.",
""" I challenge investors to think long and hard on what they believe the catalyst is for Uniti to rise between now and 2020.""1) Resolution of the Aurelius lawsuit. 2) Continued growth of FCF at Win. 3) Lease up of fiber capacity once 5g rolls around.""Mid-single digit declines in OIBDAR [at WIN] are expected over the next several years""WIN guided for essentially flat OIBDAR in 2018. Not sure why you're thinking mid single digit decline.""That is a lot of the debt that will need to be refinanced, and lenders are unlikely to be willing to do so in my view. ""WIN just extended maturities on a substantial portion of debt. That would indicate that lenders are willing to work with them. ""Uniti management has maintained that a bankruptcy court has no authority to change the rent amount or terms.""If that's what management said, then they are stating the obvious. No court can force two parties to enter into a contract, or to change the terms of an existing contract. All a court can do is void an existing contract or give a party the option to void a contract.""Bankruptcy comparables in this space are non-existent""Not sure what space you're referring to. There have been many bks in the telecom space. However, if you're referring to a comp for the Unit lease situation with Win, then comps are harder. I think the best comp is electricity company bankruptcies. In those cases, electric companies still had to pay market rate for their fuel. Unit's assets are essentially the ""fuel"" that Win needs to provide its service."" a private company's margins have to support the cost of doing business. ""WIN's margins more than support the cost of doing business. The only question is whether they support the cost of their debt on top of the cost of operations.Overall, I think you're putting way too much emphasis on growth for UNIT. NNN REITs like Unit are bond-like investments. I think the better way to evaluate Unit common is as a bond. Would you rather own unsecured Win debt with a YTM of 15% or Unit common which is like secured debt at the very top of the capital structure with the same yield? I say it's at the top of the cap structure because in the event of a WIN BK, Unit gets to take back what they've loaned them (infra assets) before any debtholder gets paid. In reality, I think Win continues leasing the assets from Unit and that rent will take priority over any debt holder payment in Chap 11.",
the stock has solid distribution coverage for the foreseable future; a revolving credit line for aquisitions and sees increase demand for fiber in the future.  get paid 2.40 a year to wait. the price is now in the 14’s. hold for 3 years. this is worth the risk.,
"Michael,Appreciate the view. Curious as to you not seeing upside potential on current towers held, and ability of 2nd lease? With 5 G coming, these secondary profits could make a substantial difference, yes? Management has grown its diversity to 33% of the portfolio (they indicate first year was consolidation, not expansion) in 18 months. They see similar in the next 18 months. So I will say another two years and WIN is a 50% partner. That's real growth eh? I believe they also said no dilution of stock THIS year. It obviously is not going to be easy, but management is fighting hard to make it work, and that is a big plus in my book. Hopefully 18 months from now, the company is a lean, mean fighting machine, with even a better future than now.I am LONG Uniti stock.",
"Michael, isn't it ironic that the ticker for Windstream is WIN?Windstream is not a winner.  It's a real loser.It's a long sad story how I ended up with Windstream.Back in the days when I was relatively young and stupid, I invested in a stock called Mindspring.  One of those ridiculously overpriced high flying momentum stocks.Of course, my mother was horrified.""Stupid is as stupid does,"" she said.Mindspring did very well for a while.  Then it went to hell in a handbasket.  Then it became Earthlink.  Then it became Windstream.  All terrible stocks.You can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse.And now I am a shareholder of three terrible stocks.  Windstream, Frontier and GE.Lucky me.",
Not stated is UNITs ability to sell existing fiber bandwidth with little additional cost plus more benefits coming from further integration of acquisitions made.The stock price could recover faster than people fear although cutting the dividend sets them back a long time,
"Michael, the first paragraph under ""Capital Structure, Moody's Downgrades"" does not seem accurate. I'd have to research the loan positions, but my understanding is that they are all pushed out quite far now. I can state that Windstream is indeed aggressively cutting costs and has worked effectively to reduce customer attrition. Their SD-WAN and OfficeSuite products are main areas of growth. In his most recent presentation, Thomas said they would likely sell off unused fiber and a component of the Broadband acquisition. Plus, they are gaining ground in the business sector. Notice they are moderating a discussion on digital pathology, (http://bit.ly/2ta8Frn). Windstream's bankruptcy risk has dropped, and the fundamental changes they are making will likely make them a prosperous company by 2020.",
Thanks for the article. I am long UNIT and will continue to watch (but not too long).,
"In my mind the central question is: How much haircut will UNIT's master lease experience during WIN's restructuring?Assuming a 25% haircut, UNIT will get $162.5M less revenue from WIN per year, which means ~$0.93/share dividend cut. UNIT can still maintain ~$1.48/year in distribution. At today's price, that's still a ~10% yield.The current lease isn't a disaster for WIN. Escalators are below inflation and coverage is still decent. Also, in a restructuring, don't you think UNIT will get something in return, for accepting a haircut?I think selling puts is a decent risk-reward.",

"Absolutely true that there is rarely an earnings call that isn’t all roses and sunshine. I appreciate the contrary view and open disclosure. I have a different view, particularly that legal case against Windstream is the largest overhang on the stock and once that is addressed the capital flexibility for unit will improve. I also think that while their earnings were not a homerun, they were solid and the management is making appropriate decisions going forward.All that said, I’ve been wrong before and Agree this one has risks.",
"Good article.But they really were confident that they would diversify near a 50-50 ratio by mid year 2019, vs the current 30-70.  As you say they reference alternative funding, I can't guess how a preferred or whatever they are planning would work out.I am unsure why they would talk about this if they didn't have it essentially lined up.",

"Yes we have heard this short story before but I don’t buy it. The lease will not be renegotiated, I will take my chances with Unit. Thanks for the article",
Completely senseless. Unit offers high yield at this price. If chase growth go buy something else like Tesla. I want dividend.,
You are suggesting that a dividend cut will help.  WIN already did that and they are the weaker link.  Therefore they have already made a positive move toward health.  Time will tell.,

It screamed sucker play months ago and I don't think much has changed since then. Nice post.,Uniti And Windstream Debt Downgrade: What It Means
"Request for Letter Writing CampaignMy theory, and it is only that, is The FTC may be part of the problem here.  No great brain storm there; they held up the original Walgreens merger for 2 years, however, I smell an additional problem now, which requires further action, and for those of you who are not lazy that do more than talk here to write one more important letter:It should not be lost on most of you, but perhaps need reminding, that as soon as Walgreens was given the blessing of The FTC to purchase 1900 Rite Aid stores, Walgreens IMMEDIATELY announced that they would close (not sell) 600 of them that were within 1 mile of an existing Walgreens store.  How does this maintain competition; it obviously lessens it.  Those 600 stores could have easily been sold to Freds that was eagerly waiting to grow and make something of themselves.  Given the close proximity of the sale and closure of stores, The FTC gave their blessing to it.  So, it is reasonable to conclude that something is wrong here, WITH THE FTC, and it is reasonable to conclude that something could be just as wrong if The FTC allows a merger with Albertsons that is obviously in deep financial trouble, unable to go public twice already, in one of the worst retail industries of supermarkets.  It is also true that Cerberus senior management is filled with Wall Street executives AND others closely aligned with past Republican administrations-Dan Quayle, former Vice-President and John Snow.  So, something smells wrong here.....You are urged to write Senator Klobuchar, Ranking Democrat, serving on the sub-committee that oversees The FTC, suggesting that her committee needs to investigate this whole Rite Aid merger matter, as it certainly hints of some sort of malfeasance on the part of The FTC.  It may be true that the Trump administration wants to lessen business restrictions generally, but when you look at the background of the Cerberus senior executives and the close ties they may have with this administration, The FTC may not be a friend of the Rite Aid shareholder given the irregularities in this transaction, especially if The FTC approves this fool hearty merger.  My copy of the letter being sent to Senator Klobuchar will also be sent to my contact at The FTC, suggesting to him and his staff that The FTC mat be opening up a can of worms if they approve this merger.Please send your emails to: Senator Klobuchar                                              Klobuchar.senate.gov (please note a period both before and                                                                                     after the word senate)",

News alert, Amazon is not the first company to try this.   There was an attempt by many grocers in the early days of the internet to try this and it was a dismal waste of resources.   Second, Albertsons is far from the flailing conglomerate of loser banners that some would want to believe.   Buying stores all over the country at fire-sale prices (just like they are trying to do with RAD) has resulted in mounds of debt and that's the risk but if you believe that they can pull off this experiment there is only one way to currently own the company and that's by buying RAD.

RAD has been a joke for quite some time now with Standley being amongst the biggest idiots of all time in a CEO position.  I wish he would tell shareholders if he has ever heard of fiduciary duty?  If he has then he is a crook who should be jailed for willful ignorance of an important concept of being a publicly held company.  Scum bags like him exist all to often and add nothing to the overall system.  Cerberus is basically playing the good ole screw a bad situation's shareholders base and try to make money at their expense.

"I am in group 3 of your article.   Your assessment of prospects going it alone probably encompass all the realities while mine may be more naive.   I based mine on the fact that I like many aspects of Rite Aid stores and the ones that have enthusiastic managers seem to be busy (the ones without good managers not busy).   They have been generally making money the last few years even with bigger proportional debt.   If top manage put any effort into making local management consistent, it seemed a turn-around was in the cards even in this trying time for retail.But always the caveat.    After the meeting where the sale of stores to WBA was discussed, the SA followers of Rite Aid came alive on the forums.     Everyone was horrified.   Consensus was 'that was the worst presentation ever', 'what is he trying to do, intentionally torpedo the stock?'    Now we know.   Specially now that we know that a top ... uh ... dog with Albertsons & associates is an old friend of our very own CEO Standley.   With stock price in the toilet and many recent investors quickly discouraged, RAD was now available as a real bargain and with less solid opposition.   So Standley now gets what could be a plum job and perhaps some change of control bonuses and hangs out with his old friends.  There is real value in this merger, just not for shareholders.   So much for management pointing out that the focus could now be on making RAD live up to its potential.    What rational person wouldn't think this was contrived for a very long time?  What rational person would really not believe that shareholder value was intentionally diminished to facilitate this ""merger "".Your assessments may be more accurate than many in my category would like to admit.   Will the institutional buyers support a ""no"" vote and a change in management.   Why should they?   There is a very small chance that that this thing could work and most the bigger investors are probably well diversified ETF's.   Any losses they realize will be proportionally much smaller than we average retail investors who may have well over 10 percent of their portfolio invested here.   ETF's are always pointing this out as a risk of investing on your own when seeking investors in their fund.   This event may be a wonderfully good example of a bad example for investing on your own.    Like many direct investors, I see little encouraging at the moment for this particular investment.   That does not mean I am going to be rash (like I would if imminent bankruptcy).It can get worse and likely will if the merger goes through and we hold the new stock for long; but not likely by much short-term.  My approach will be to bide for a more graceful exit, vote ""no"" , add comment to regulators, support any change in current management and accept that there are really quite a large number of confounding events have substantial probability of derailing this management plan.",
"$RAD will fall more after the merger because shareholders are getting fleeced. hold the stock and vote no, then sell before the deal closes*.Or wait for the inevitable activist action coming in, sell the bump.* https://seekingalpha.c...",
"Kumquat researchNice article, presenting various options, but unless I read it too fast, you left out some vital information:1. I have no idea whether or not the lawyers will conclude a Class Action Complaint is warranted yet, since they are waiting to review the chronology of events leading up to this ridiculous offer, however, they will be evaluating whether:A. the sale process was ""fair"" and B. did the board meet their fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders2. You have failed to even mention, surprisingly, that Standley's primary motive ever since 2012, when he replaced Mary Sammons as Chairman/CEO was to sell the company for his ""accumulated stock options"" worth millions.  It should not be lost on the reviewing lawyers that shareholders voted in the majority to immediately STOP this undeserved perk , well in advance of the original Walgreens offer in 2015.  The board, working for Standley and themselves, refused to change the by-laws reflecting the voice of their shareholders.3..  Both Standley and Miller (Chairman/CEO of Albertsons now and Rite Aid previously) have engaged themselves in unethical conduct previously at Rite Aid or allowed it to continue by others as Chairman of the Board, always for their personal greed or that of others on the board.  This will be presented to The SEC for review.  The SEC had been aware of some of this already, and forced corrective action in the past.4.  As far as a ""fair"" sale process, you already answered this for us.  Walgreens paid well over $2 million per store, and Albertsons , given their cozy relationship with Standley (who reported directly to Miller at RAD from 2000-2005) wants to pay less than one half that.  A judge could put the brakes on this deal on that alone, although I count on nothing5. Many here, including myself, especially based on the above, want another option, namely to run the company professionally.  I know I have mentioned this way too much, and you can choose to accept it or not, but with over 13 years of making hundreds of unannounced visits to stores until 2015, I can say that the stores were horribly mismanaged. Standley knows mismanagement; he led his prior Pathmark stores to some of the worst customer service  reviews reported by Consumer Reports.  6. Perhaps the biggest warning of this deal, is Standley selling Pathmark to A & P in 2007, which hastened A & P's bankruptcy, and then the supermarket business was in better shape than today.7. Your comment that shareholders are fatigued is somewhat misplaced.  Simply, if this deal fails it will be the end of Standley at Rite Aid (and likely the board).  Nothing would re-energize shareholders, large and small, than a brand new management that really want to exercise a turnaround, rather than Standley's greed right from the start to affect a sale.  His absence from the company being on multiple boards, while the company was already mismanaged from before, mismanaged by him from before his return, mismanaged by Miller from before, and now they want it back again to do the same, likely, all over again; it speaks volumes.8. If shareholders are fatigued maybe they should not be in the market at all.  Most stocks have bumps along the way; OK, RAD has been a mountain along the way.  However, a ""NO"" vote signals Standley will go, AND, in my view, would initially raise the stock price in anticipation of a better management coming in.  Without reservation, we have given away untold revenues and profits to our competition, due to this mismanagement and incompetence, a ""NO"" vote majority would initiate an opportunity to get them back",
"Historically, Albertsons has benefited from a partnership with a competent ""drug"" partner.  This was the basis for the partnership between Albertsons and Skaggs.  Rite Aid will manage the drug side of the business and Albertsons the grocery side.  A 70-30 split is about right!The problem that people overlook with Rite Aid as a standalone is that while store count was cut in half, SG&A was not.  They were only looking at about 100MM in savings to be realized only after a couple of years.  This deal will allow the Administrative of the drug side to be leveraged.  Likewise, Albertsons can lend their grocery expertise to the standalone Rite Aid's front-end.  The author mentioned the leverage available in drug sourcing as well.  Also, Albertsons manufactures things like bread, dairy and soft drinks which will now have double the outlets.  These are things that people will pick up along with a prescription.The Rite Aid team can pretty much hand off the distribution side of things.  Their DC's can be absorbed into Albertsons and the combined distribution footprint can serve both formats.  Also, there is a carveout in the standstill agreement that will allow Cerberus to acquire up to 30% of the shares in the new company (about the number distributed to RAD holders.)  So, if they see the share price in a ""distressed"" situation (their specialty), then they can swoop in and buy shares even cheaper at a convenient pace.  This would support the eventual share price for when they ultimately exit.  In other words, they may have to make a market in the shares as their efficiency plans unfold.",
"What you are missing in your assessment is the risk that the deal doesn't happen.  This is the 3rd attempt at an IPO of Albertsons by Cerberus, the previous two have been failed efforts.  Cerberus is estimating a market cap of $9.1 billion for the new ""mergeco"", or about $23.15 per share.  If that drops to much below $20, Cerberus may pull the plug on it.The other issue here is the FTC.  Lots of RADs and Albertsons stores are in the same strip malls.  Would the FTC force them to firesale those RADs (which in my opinion could kill this deal because I think Cerberus wants to start selling those assets as soon as the deal is consummated).And so we are back to the question of what RAD is worth independent of being acquired or merged.As to the upside here, I think it is that some of the larger shareholders balk and force Albertsons to sweeten the deal.  A few extra pennies per share in cash and moving the share swap ratio from 10:1 to 9:1 would get the implied value up closer to $3.The idea that a white knight is going to show up and swoop RAD away at a higher valuation is a pipe dream.  Never say never, but don't bet your hard-earned money on it.",
"Most of you posting here so far had already sold your shares, so to insist on this being a done “bad” deal is soothing for you to convince yourselves your decision was the correct one.  Otherwise why bother to post here with no more skin in the game?However for the rest of shareholders, we’ll not vote for this proposed merger.  If we fail to stop the merger, at least we still will get a bit more over the current price. So, stay put to fight it is a good strategy in my opinion.  Either way, we’ll get more than what RAD is trading at this point.",
negative nellies always think the glass is half empty when it is really half full....https://seekingalpha.c...,
"I don't like any of the outcome or options you provided, however, reality is it doesn't matter. Most of the investment funds are passive funds or may hold less than .05% of their portfolio. I saw few state pension funds added more shares in Q4 (mostly to double down). None of them will stand up and fight. To me CEO and BOD are compromised to an extent they are not even ready to cover up anything. They are not even trying to pump it up. They are giving a message take it or leave it but I am taking the best offer I can ever get. I believe more longs are selling and putting money to better use which is what CEO and Cerberus wants. Anyone buys around $2 won't mind if $2.5 in 3 to 6 months or even okay to take 10% loss and move on. Less long time longs they have better for them.Great article explaining gravity and reality.",
"In the morning when the merge deal was announced, I was hoping the merge price will offset my losses, or even make a small gain.  I managed to read the ""details"" of the deal before 9 am and learned the value of Albertsons was $24B, 2X of Cerberus' investment.   That was all I need to know that this was. really bad deal for RAD.   So I sold all RAD shares pre-market as the price was falling.  Got out @ $2.44, 2.35, and finally 2.11.",
RAD will be attractive when its a buck or less.,
"If you believe the deal undervalues RAD, yet the combined company will continue to trade, wouldn’t that mean that current shareholders will still own an undervalued combined company? That point seems to negate some negativity.",

"The Trump photo on this page is quite telling. Donald Trump has always been hyper emotional, and he pushes people into arguments. Its his persona. It is 'entertaining' for some people... But awful in a US President. Trump has come across consistently as an unrepentant bully. Yet when it comes to steel tariffs, Warren demonstrated her ability to be cool, calm and collected, to stand above the President's name calling, and refuse to join with the GOP in blocking his trade tariffs.I personally disagree with her, though I think the President and Congress could have done a lot more to gain the support of Congress, various parts of industry, and the unions.. But I respect Warren for standing up for what she believes in despite any political fall out. I'm tired of the GOP members constantly hurling partisan complaints about ""Liberals""... They are being divisive, bad for the country. They should remember the real history here and stop trying to rewrite it. GOP members are also pushing the kind of radical and angry sounding rhetoric that causes some to lose their objectivity about various topics and issues. Enough already. We had the GW Bush years, which left the USA in economic danger. Obama helped to set that ship right. GOP should be thankful that they had so much varied backing that they got into office despite Obama's obvious success. The latest round of votes was a disaster... many voters lost their right to vote due to a new computer system called ""Crosscheck"".. and some states have abandoned that program due to problematic results. Let's hope 2018-2019 leads us into a new more unified phase and away from this wretched name calling hostility that has no place in the White House or in US politics in general.On to what's best for the country.""THE WALL STREET JOURNALAs GOP considers blocking tariffs, Elizabeth Warren, other Democrats back Trump""Published: Mar 12, 2018http://bit.ly/2GkVWW3""Republican lawmakers are openly discussing legislation to limit President Donald Trump’s trade powers after the White House detailed plans last week to impose global tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum.But the support of key Democrats — including Sen.

"The taiffs hurt way more than they help.  STLD and NUE are healthy, so they only help a few companies like X and AKS, maybe AA.  They hurt, all steel users such as auto and truck makers, steel can users, appliance makers, the cost of construction projects and much more.  They also hurt the consumers of those industries with higher costs, that means all of us.Whats more, these tariffs like the others Trump has done are completely unnecessary.  We have a 4% unemployment rate in this country, which is considered full employment.  So we are not protecting workers.  Trump says without a steel industry we have no country.  That is so 60 years ago.  Our country excels at cutting edge information and medical technology, innovation, marketing, secondary education, capital availablility and infrastructure.  We are way ahead in most of those areas.  And besides, we HAVE a steel industry, that was not going away.",

The merger is opposed for purely political reasons. Time Warner (TW) owns CNN which was and is critical of Trump. This is political score settling and retaliation. A year ago Kushner met with the TW CEO and told him as much. Story is here:https://usat.ly/2F9Q1Sg,
"Companies make money if they are well-managed. We have no idea how well T will manage a content company. They could even alienate other distribution channels. I also question why a content company would have so much debt and such a high dividend. The mix of businesses will be radically different, not a bad thing, but not a utility to be leveraged to the gunnels. In fact I would deem the dividend as inappropriate to the business mix and maintaining it might even be a dereliction of duty on the part of directors. Content is an opportunity but also is riskier. It will be interesting to see the bond rating 2-3 years from now.",

There are significant barriers of entry to set up shop and produce lithium which is why smaller players won't be able to quickly come in and create an oversupply of lithium in the near future.As an individual company, ALB is extremely solid with strong cash flow, higher dividend payouts each year, strong earnings and low debt.

"I  have read about the break-up value of GE being below $12.  And the board is full of a bunch of idiots that are over the hill and clueless. Jeff Immelt should have been fired for cause and sued to prevent any termination clause of his contract from being fulfilled.  GE has enough lawyers to make it tremendously expense for Immelt to fight it and he was clearly liable for gross violations of his fiduciary responsibilities.  I have never heard of a single CEO in the world flying with a backup jet, the entire board should have been canned for participating in this debacle.  It is time to break up and sell the parts for the sake of the shareholders.  The shareholders need to file some class action lawsuits to rid themselves of the board and to target Immelt, and GE replaced Immelt with Flannery, an insider?

I don’t know how many SA articles I read and many comments about how the money spent buying back shares was a return to stockholders.

"This analysis has some flaws, IMO.  The segment valuations are applying public company Price/Earnings multiples against General Electric's EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Tax).  After deducting tax and interest expense, the valuation case unravels.  You need to do the EV/EBITDA analysis, which suggests fair value at around $15, excluding the pension liability.  Due to the long term care insurance fiasco, the finance business is unlikely to pay a cash dividend up to consolidated entity through 2024, so most analyst are appropriately placing a zero value on the finance business.  Thus, we only have ~$0.90 of industrial earnings and cash flow to cover the pension funding and dividend.  There is not much left to fix and grow the business let alone survive a future financial crisis.  Towards the end, Immelt was desperate to keep the numbers going.  My personal concern is that Immelt buried current operating lossess.  How?  Example: report a profit on a power turbine sale through an under-priced long term financing and/or service agreement.  On the positive side, sentiment is so negative I think there will be sharp trading rallies that should be faded.",

"Finding a bottom in something as complex as GE is a waste of time. Excluding past gains and dividends my account says I am down 43% on GE and the reason I could care less is two fold.....First of all GE is only 6% at cost of my trading account which is some smaller percent of my total assets.  I track the total only when I feel like making a big move and the market hasn't scared me that much yet. Second is that since 1928, there is plenty of information about how the SP500 has performed and you can back test all these stalwarts until the cows come home and see a theme.  The theme is enough of them rebound to be worth the gamble.In other words I have no fn idea what will happen to GE but I have confidence I can get more than 8% cagr from it going forward becaue I do not see signs of immenent disaster. 1) Everyone is talking about it ad nauseum, which means there is no concensus, and 2) Why would so many people who are convinced it has more to fall be watching it so closely now?Maybe there are a fair number out there averaging down?More often than not, most of the Dow components and SP500 darlings come back to the SP500 8.4% cagr average from 1928 (just before the biggest market crash) to 2011 (a little after the last big crash). This does not happen overnight and in the case of GE is it is 17 years behind the market...yet its still here.Today the SP500 average stands around 9.4% cagr if you add in the last five years which have been very strong but I rather work from the top of the 1920s market to the bottom of one now (close enough using 2011, the last time I bothered to to all the math myself) 9.4% is closer to Wall Street's active money managers' traditional 10% cagr average.  I use 8% when looking around the SP500 for losers and then evaluate whether they are since the last beating, and determine from there how much life they got left.GE bottomed around 6/sh in 2009, which when compounded at 8% out to 2018 is about 12/sh...this will be the next point when I give some hard thought to buying more GE. For now I am just fascinated in where the bottom will be in GE because I see no evidence anyone has a clue, and yet when the price is low enough and you are going long, all it has to do is meet your expectations.Where do I see it going in the future?  Well anyone who wants to run out and build a jet engine or be the next player in healthcare probably doesn't have the connections that GE has to bust in. The energy and oil part of GE (about 25% of the business) is poised for growth and selling divisions like the locomotives is selling off of small income streams.  The forecasts for airliner growth in Asia call for 5000 more planes in the next 20 years and oil consumption has steadily climbed 2% a year for the last 50 years....and GE is 50% off in the last 12 months.....GE has also proven it can survive the insular nature of its management, and in my opinion should have put a tough woman with all the identity-politics cards in the world to play to whip it up, but instead found the whitest old guy they could once again. The real battle here is does GE belong in the past only to languish or will it meet the future and take a slice of it? I side on the latter and will keep throwing a little down the hole when it reaches my checkpoints, which yes have absolutely nothing to do with technicals/fundamental... I am simply playing the long term averages.",
"GE has been bottoming for several years now. .  ""2 Jet Jeffy"" was the top.",
"thanks for the great article. I believe many people are looking at GE from the wrong perspective. Too many people are of the mindset that they just have to buy GE and wait for a recovery. There is simply way too much naive hope and faith in such thinking. Management has suckered shareholders into believing GE has a guaranteed bright future or roses and rainbows, and Im not yet convinced that is so accurate.I think the dividend will need to be cut again. As such, I don't see $10 as being unreasonable. Since markets tend to over-react, I also think high single digits are extremely likely. From my perspective, GE just isn't worth the gamble until after the dust settles from the next dividend cut. Why anyone would wait this out such uncertainty is beyond me. There are other better companies out there to gamble on.",
"Plenty of companies have great assets, but you have to also look at the liability side of the business. GE is a very heavily leveraged company. Their debt is more than their market cap. With interest rates rising, refinancing is going to get more and more expensive. If cash flow is a problem now, it will only get worse as interest rates rise.GE equity is a long term call option at best on their underlying assets. More and more cash flow will have to go to debt service as interest rates rise. Their stock buybacks have left a ton of debt on their balance sheet, GE will be paying for this for years.A better question to ask about GE is not where is the bottom, but what is the value? We see bankrupt companies bottoming way above eventual recovery value for a long time before crashing down when reality hits, like SDRL for example. Right now there are tons of people trying to catch a bottom with GE, that pretty much guarantees that GE is not near bottom. The fact is, if you look at the cash flows, GE is pretty much owned by the creditors and pension, there is very little remaining value for equity owners. As interest rates rise, what are the chances that GE can improve their businesses fast enough to increase cash flow available to stockholders?GE is a classic example of being tempted by low interest rates to make marginal investments. When the investment doesn't pay off, the debt remains. Even if the stock price bottoms, it will be an L bottom and not a V bottom. The value was destroyed a long time ago, it is only now the market is pricing that in.",
"God I wish Buffett would buy GE. One of several great things, and probably my very favorite, would be to hear the brilliant and succinct Buffett make several intellectual-yet-snark... comments about that dipshit ""2 Jet Jeffy"" and how he managed to run the great GE into the ditch . . .",
"Fairly balanced article, but you left out some things. You failed to discuss renewables in a balanced way. For example, how much did the purchase of their blade supplier in France affect the business growth you articulated, we all know that the hardware margins in this business are low( I venture to assert lower than major appliances sold as non-core) and that what holds all the future promise of  income growth are potential maintenance contracts.  The company just announced a 400M investment in a future windmill development and off-shore installation with the largest blade ever implemented. This in the face of a cash flow problem and a possible pay-off in 2020 and beyond. You also skimmed over the deleterious impact of the Alstom acquisition on the power business performance and the fact that the new CEO was given credit for being instrumental in making the acquisition. As far as the problems at GE Capital are concerned what should we conclude from the fact tthe new CEO’s history of his almost 30 years was at GE Capital?",

GE's problem is China.OK it's also a problem that they've been hiding these huge liabilities for too long - hiding them from themselves.  But China is the real problem that caused most of the (non-finance division) liabilities.  And even helped push GE further into finance.,
"No, definitely did not just bottom. We're entering bear market and GE will continue down, not because it's GE and has been mismanaged (Jack Welch--worst CEO of all time?), but because the market as a whole is in downward trend and will remain so until P/Es return to normal levels (you can ask Warren Buffett for details).  Few stocks will be spared.",
"In GE when I was there in the 80s there was a saying: you don't know what you don't know. With this new GE there is a new surprise every month. Each month another SA contributor implies this is the bottom for GE. Just like a broken clock, one of them will be right. At some point GE will bottom but is 14 the bottom. If you told me two years ago GE could be at this price, I would have thought you were nuts. I predict GE will bottom at 10 due to a new unannounced surprise. If I am right then I can post that I called the bottom. No analysts, just someone that has been buying stocks for 40 years . I'd rather buy MCD in the 140s than GE at 14. I have a buy in on PII at 109. I think either of these have better upside than GE. Just my thoughts of what I am doing and not a recommendation for you to follow.

"Has GE bottomed?  Historical data would indicate support at $14.20 and $14.80 that didn't materialize.  The stock keeps trying to establish a base but continues to set new lows.  52 week low of $13.95 and today it went down to $13.97.  Just because a stock hits a new yearly low doesn't mean it has bottomed it only means it is still trying to find support.  GE lost huge value while the market was on a massive up swing.  Now that the market is correcting analysts want to point to how small GE stock losses are compared to rest of the correcting market.  GE may even go up when the rest of the market is correcting, and this is the new bottom?  Two key items you left off the liabilities list are: How much value is GE pension fund losing in their ownership of GE stock? How much is the DOJ investigation into mortgage practice going to cost GE and then GE will have to settle law suits with other companies over inflated mortgage values.  One article  read said something like GE is being sued by just one bank for around 4.5 billion.  GE won't bottom until the market knows what the  REAL liabilities are.  Yes these are known issues and are supposedly already factored into GE share price.  Just like the market knew about the long term care issues at GE based on the same problem at other companies.  What the market expected was a $1-$2 billion adjustment not a 6.5 (after taxes so that $9 billion doesn't sound as bad) and an additional $15 Billion going forward for 6-7 years (and the possibility it could even get worse).  So even though the issues are ""KNOWN"" that just means you were already told to drop your pants and bend over when you purchase GE stock.  Disclaimer: I don't believe GE can stay trading between $14-$15 it has fallen much too far much to fast.  Long GE with June $15 and $16 calls and short GE with June $14 puts.",
Did GE bottom?LMAO.,
"Victor - great article, thanks for contributing. I owned GE, which I purchased in May of 2010 @ 16-18 (multiple lots) and which I dumped last year in June @ 28+.   My philosophy on this is that there is no need to rush in to this thing trying to call the bottom.   If and when it does, I will happily let others taken that first 10-30% off the low. In the meantime, even those businesses who are doing well within GE are being impacted.  I have no doubt that some of those highly skilled employees in those parts of the business are looking elsewhere to greener pastures.  After all, with GE laying off employees and doing all kinds of other things to save cash, and with the stock cratering, offering them RSU isn't as appealing as for employees whose stock is rising. Anyway, thanks for the article.  Even though I am not ready to jump into GE, I appreciate your effort.",
"The unknown is how much more bad news isn't yet out.  It is certainly > 0, and could be a lot.",

"In light of what has occurred at GE, a total demonstration of mismanagement and accounting trickery (exercised over Immelt's entire reign), none of which the analyst and institutional hierarchy felt compelled to intervene to disclose and demand corrective action, I have no understanding why so many people are willing to search for a bottom for this crap company, I don't care what their history represents, or whether the stock can go to $20.  What exactly does it take to have investors turn away.  GE is the classic Harvard Business case study in the making, and damn well it should be.  This has been an enormous debacle and the wealth destruction Immelt's regime has imposed on thousands of pensioners and shareholders, while enriching themselves, seems to get overlooked with all of this dissecting of the numbers.  GE, as a company, its management, it Board of Directors, never mind KPM&G issued quarterly and annual certified financial statements that were not only incorrect, but most likely and deliberately misleading, particularly at GE Capital.  At the very same time, they awarded themselves with bonuses, stock options, stock awards, and the like for meeting their goals.  Who holds these people accountable for their actions?  Who initiates the efforts to claw-back the monies given to Immelt, Sherin, Bornstein, Neal, and the list goes on.  There was a hell of a lot wrong at GE other than numbers and its a bit short-sighted for the analyst to continually focus on where the bottom is versus how the hell they got there and who the culprits were.  And lets not forget, Mr. Flannery and Ms. Miller were very much a part of that team: they played in the same sandbox and reaped the same rewards.  Now look whose calling the kettle black?  In my opinion, if you want to wait out the storm and hold your position, nothing wrong with that.  However, for new money, you have to let yourself look elsewhere at the Honeywells, United Technologies, Boeing, or even treat yourself to the likes of Disney, Comcast, Google, or Amazon - all a hell of a lot better than wasting it on a company who has spent the past eighteen years, turning its back on its shareholders and pensioners.",

There is still too much interest in speculative analysis and predicting bottoms, recovery, further demise, etc and there is still too much negative sentiment swirling around GE, and of course there is always possibility for more cockroaches in the kitchen. After all the infamous corporate crook Immelt himself was in charge of the ""kitchen"" for many years and left only a few months ago - cleaning is still in progress.

"I'm long QCOM, but the stock has been abysmal over the past 5 years.  It's flat over that time, while many other tech companies are up 150% to 250% during the same period.  The dividend is great, but isn't enough to make up for that.I don't have a lot of faith in management, as their promises never seem to materialize.  The NXPI deal will close soon, but the market doesn't seem to value that very much.  I'm not as hopeful as some people that AAPL will settle soon, though I do believe that QCOM is in the right and will prevail eventually.However, AVGO is basically Valeant.  Over-valued and focused on short-term gains.  I think its facade will fall apart at some point.  I voted for QCOM's board picks.  If it looks like AVGO will succeed in the takeover, I'll try to cash out near the deal price rather than get stuck with AVGO stock.",
"So many people are mischaracterizing the increase in the bid for NXPI.On one hand you had people saying that QCOM didn't care about closing the deal (or was trying to scam people) before they raised the bid, but there was no point in raising the bid until near the point where it was clear it would pass the regulatory approvals.  Since the market seems sure this deal will close, raising the bid just boosts NXPI to near the offer price and gives people the argument for another raise.  Better to wait for the right time.On the other hand, you have people saying that QCOM only raised the bid to try and fend off Broadcomm.  That may have had something to do with the *timing* of the new bid, but it had become pretty clear that the deal would never close at $110.  On the other hand, QCOM wasn't so desperate that they gave in and offered the $135  that Elliot was looking for.It's pretty clear to me that QCOM wanted to ensure the deal closed (because they see the value in NXPI), but not at any cost.  Especially given the looming takeover bid, the board has to make sure the deal makes sense for shareholders.",
"The problem with this article is it uses the same weak argument Hock Tan uses when explaining why Qualcomm management needs to change. Namely the lack of share price appreciation the last several years. And the reason why that reasoning is weak is because it's based on the share price, not the companies fundamentals. It fails to consider that Qualcomm shares were over-valued by investors in the years leading up to the period of underperformance and it lays blame for Apples tortuous interference and meddling with foreign regulators that resulted in questionable fines at the feet of Qualcomm's management when, in fact, this was largely out of their control. They cannot prevent Apple from presenting false testimony or forcing their suppliers to break contracts with Qualcomm. Apple is a bully, you can't negotiate with them because it's their way or the highway. The only way to deal with such outrageous behavior is through legal means. Fortunately, Qualcomm has the experience as well as the resources to defend their intellectual property rights, they have been doing so successfully for over 20 years. But yes, court dockets have waiting lists and Apple has the ability to slow down the process. But that ability is not without it's limits and, in the end, Qualcomm's business model will be upheld, once again.",
"The bottom line is the regulatory concerns are rapidly ballooning. The risk to QCOM shareholders of accepting a deal with such a man as Hock Tan in this climate are great enough to make supporting such a move foolhardy. I say that because, even if a deal is accepted for a higher price than the previous best offer, QCOM shares would be locked into a trading range due to the risk of the deal dragging on forever before collapsing. In the interim, the value of the company would be getting trashed and the share price would gradually follow as it became apparent the deal was a failed enterprise.Qualcomm would be left in shambles.",

"Financial Times article (paywall):Broadcom’s $142bn hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm is raising data protection concerns among European lawmakers as they fear the Singapore-based chipmaker could gain control of sensitive EU citizen data.Qualcomm recently secured a $44bn agreement to buy NXP, a Dutch group that makes chips for German passports, and European officials are uncomfortable with Broadcom having access to such information. “We are concerned about the possibility of a European company handling sensitive data of EU citizens falling in the hands of a company that is based in Singapore, where data protection standards are lower than in the EU,” Josef Weidenholzer, vice-president of the S&D, the second-largest party in the European Parliament, told the Financial Times.This comes days after US lawmakers urged the Trump administration to open an investigation into Broadcom’s bid as they argued that it would be “deeply concerning” if a foreign company took control of a US group through a proxy fight without first gaining the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.Broadcom said earlier this week that its takeover of Qualcomm, which would be the largest tech deal ever, should not be scrutinised by Cfius as “Broadcom is committed to reincorporating from Singapore to the US, and expects to receive the required approvals to do so by the end of Broadcom’s fiscal second quarter.”A person close to Broadcom said the chipmaker is ready to work closely with European authorities to protect the data and privacy of EU citizens. Political pressure against Broadcom’s bid on both sides of the Atlantic comes ahead of a critical Qualcomm shareholder meeting on March 6, when investors of the San Diego-based company will vote on a slate of six out of 11 directors nominated by the Singapore-based group.Broadcom’s potential takeover of NXP also has a number of German politicians on edge about the future of NXP’s plant in Hamburg, given the Singaporean company’s reputation for aggressive cost-cutting, including laying off workers and stripping research and development. Niels Annen, a Social Democrat member of parliament from Hamburg, said: “Qualcomm made a range of assurances regarding the plant in Hamburg that were very positive. There were no such signals from Broadcom and that has raised concerns.”Although the vote is likely to be very close, several stockbrokers buying and selling shares on behalf of large investors said the tide is shifting in favour of Qualcomm’s management, which is opposed to Broadcom’s board changes and existing takeover proposal. Parnassus Endeavor Fund, a top-30 investor in Qualcomm, said it would vote in favour of the current board and against the slate of six out of 11 directors proposed by Broadcom. “The current Qualcomm board is committed to getting a higher price or staying independent, and we agree that Qualcomm’s stock is worth much more,” said Jerome Dodson, Parnassus portfolio manager.Several Qualcomm shareholders are concerned that if Broadcom’s nominees take control of its board they could force the company to agree to a deal that is not in the best interest of investors. While the public vow of support by a major shareholder is a strong vote of confidence for Qualcomm’s management, other investors are more open to voting in some of Broadcom’s nominees to bring new points of view to the board.Earlier this week Qualcomm said it was open to engage further with Broadcom on a higher price than its current “best and final offer” of $79 per share, valuing the company at $142bn, including $25bn in net debt. ",
I wonder how many Apple shares the proposed Broadcom directors own?they could get in there an just really muck up Qcom's lawsuit with Apple.,

Europe is strongly against Broadcom buying Qualcomm because of Qualcomm's purchase of NXP.  Plus broker's are starting to see the voting tide shift in Qualcomm's favor:http://bit.ly/2t9BVi1,

"Agree with author, QCOM is a better bet...",
A very good analysis. I have 20 call options at $70 expiring March 16 and another 20 expiring April 20. I am sure both sides are secretly talking like they did last Friday February 23rd in spite of the rhetoric we hear in the news. To avoid an embarrassment both sides will come to an agreement that is a win win.,
Broadcom’s plans to move to the U.S. will make CFIUS concerns moot point. Besides Mr. Tan made a high profile visit to the White House and promised Mr. Trump what he liked to hear.,
"I'm with you author. I believe in the QCOM's tech, R&D, and long term horizon. If AVGO comes up to $90+ I don't know who could turn it down but a lot can happen before any deal could close. Assuming the NXPI deal closes, APPL will almost certainly settle (I think within 6 months), those are two huge drivers for the stock and general sentiment. If I end up holding my QCOM shares through an $8 billion breakup fee, well I'd be pleased as punch. QCOM has a bright future imo.",
I believe QCOM will be bought and have voted all my shares for Broadcom’s Board.  It is a very good deal.  I get cash and stock in new company with great management and chance to participate in new company even more if I want by using the cash provided to me.  So why not go with the deal?  QCOM Mgmt and BODs have been selling stock at lower prices.  I can’t trust them.  They are only interested in their enormous salaries and fees.  I want to jump on the Hock Tan train and if you own shares should as well.,

Naivete. Steve,
"Why would Broadcom pay such a high price for 4-5 board members , they will agree only if they have a majority",
"You neglect CFIUS review and regulatory / execution hazards. Even if both sides tentatively agree to a deal, the market may appropriately price QCOM at far below the struck price due to the extensive regulatory and execution risk of the transfer. That AVGO reduced its bid from $82 to $79 despite the substantial progress toward an accretive NXPI purchase means that it's tapped out under whatever model its lenders have for the buyout. An increased bid is unlikely in the short term.",Qualcomm Vs. Broadcom: How To Trade The Upcoming Shareholder Meeting
Vlad  - how about an update of your thoughts on CLF and AKS both of which have been dumped on trade war fears and tariff exemptions,
"Did all of you good investors read the Presidential Proclamation on Adjusting Imports of Steel into the United States, or did you just take someone else's word as to what's in it? As for me, I read it.  Of note is that the tariff applies not only to steel imports entered but also to such goods withdrawn from warehouses for consumption.  And so companies who stockpiled steel imports in advance of the tariff will have to pay the tariff anyhow.  At least, that's my interpretation.  See it for yourself if you haven't already.  http://bit.ly/2tEeKwF",

"Chippewa Capital Partners buys land, half of Nashwauk oreA sister company to Chippewa Capital Partners has purchased 1,040 acres of land and the rights to half the iron ore below at the Nashwauk mine site of its fledgling Mesabi Metallics taconite project.Deeds for the purchase were filed with Itasca County on Wednesday.The purchase appears to secure the taconite iron ore that Chippewa needs for the rebirth of the bankrupt, partly-finished former Essar Steel Minnesota project. Mesabi Metallics workers this week moved a large mining drill into place to begin the process of blasting and stripping ore off the mine wall, the first such action under the new company.The purchase gives Chippewa owner Tom Clarke not just the land but also half-ownership of the privately-owned taconite iron ore at the site, with Cleveland-Cliffs claiming ownership of the other half.The two possible co-owners have been locked in legal wrangling and verbal sparring over the ore for months.Clarke also has first rights to state of Minnesota iron ore around the Nashwauk mine site, but only if he gets the Mesabi Metallics project up and moving toward completion by summer.Clarke said he could not comment on details of the purchase. But according to Nicolle Zuehlke, Itasca County register of titles, the purchase was made by Miranda Mineral Resources LLC, one of the companies owned by Clarke and his wife. It appears one deed is for about $31 million to buy 440 acres of the land, and rights to half the ore, from Superior Mineral Resources LLC. There apparently is a mortgage for about $38 million for the 600-acre parcel, bringing the total purchase price to about $69 million.""We still firmly believe that (Essar Steel Minnesota Bankruptcy) Judge (Brendan) Shannon would have agreed with us that we still had the lease rights to that land. But with this purchase, it removes any doubt that it's our land and our ore,"" Clarke said Thursday. ""We had to get rid of that cloud over access to the mine site and we've done that now. We're going to start mining right now.""In addition to mining ore at the site, Clarke says he hopes to speed up construction at the nearby plant site in coming months, saying he already has willing buyers for taconite iron ore concentrate as well as finished pellets and possibly raw iron ore.A Cleveland-Cliffs spokesperson did not return a request to comment on the development.Battle for oreMesabi Metallics plans to mine and process taconite iron ore and turn about half into pig iron at the Nashwauk site. That pig iron will be used as an additive to make steel in electric arc mini-mill steel mills, breaking into a U.S. pig iron market that has been cornered by Brazil, Russia and the Ukraine. The other half of the taconite pellets will be sold to Mexico and Asia, Clarke has said.Superior Mineral Resources was co-owner of the private mineral rights at the site with Glacier Park Iron Ore Properties LLC. Glacier Park apparently sold its half to Cleveland-Cliffs in December, although the federal bankruptcy judge is still deciding if that sale is allowable under the Essar bankruptcy agreements.If the judge allows the December Cliffs purchase, Clarke and Cliffs would each own half the iron ore below the site. (Cliffs also has purchased other, nearby private ore.) If the judge disallowed the sale to Cliffs, Clarke would have the opportunity to buy all of the private ore at the site.""In the worst-case scenario, we are 50-50 partners with Cliffs in that ore. But we own the land we need. We have the mining permit. We will get the state"" iron ore as well, Clarke said. ""Things are rapidly falling into place now. Good things are happening.""Once completed, the all-new Mesabi Metallics facilities would employ about 350 people, with Clarke vowing to let the United Steelworkers union organize the project if the workforce chooses. If all goes well, Clarke hopes to be producing taconite pellets and pig iron in late 2020 or early 2021.India-based Essar Steel Minnesota spent $1.8 billion on the project and wasn't close to finishing the job when it walked away late in 2015 and later declared bankruptcy after years of delays and mismanagement. Engineering consultants tell Clarke it will cost another $1.3 billion to finish the mine, concentrating facility and pelletizer, then another $650 million to build the pig iron plant. Add it up, and at $3.7 billion or so it's by far Minnesota's most expensive single private construction project ever.Cliffs sues Superior Mineral ResourcesThe saga over control the Nashwauk iron ore became even more entangled recently when Cleveland-Cliffs filed suit in State District Court in Itasca County against Superior Mineral Resources.Cliffs is claiming that Superior is somehow acting wrongly by not negotiating or selling to the Cleveland-based company. The six-page suit, filed Feb. 26, also asks the court to order the owner to give Cliffs access to the land, apparently now owned by Chippewa, so Cliffs can start mining there.Meanwhile, Cliffs' December purchase of the other half of the Nashwauk ore from Glacier Park remains ensnared in the federal bankruptcy case that is determining the future of the former Essar Steel Minnesota project as Mesabi Metallics.Clarke's Chippewa Capital Partners has asked the bankruptcy judge to nullify the sale as a violation of the lager bankruptcy agreement Clarke struck to gain control of the Essar project last summer. The company officially emerged from bankruptcy the week before Christmas.While Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves said he wants the Nashwauk ore to solidify the future of the Hibbing Taconite operations his company manages, Clarke said he's willing to share the ore with Cliffs, much like Hibbing Taconite's current owners — Cliffs, ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel — already share the Hibbing mine ore.Clarke says he has no intention of competing with other Minnesota taconite producers by selling taconite pellets to U.S. blast furnace steelmakers.""We could ship our ore over to Hibbing Taconite right now,"" Clarke said.But Goncalves has said he will never enter into any partnership with Clarke or Chippewa for ore at the Nashwauk site. In addition to managing and minority interest in Hibbing Taconite, Cliffs owns and operates United Taconite and Northshore Taconite in Minnesota.The issue has pitted Goncalves against state officials and Iron Range leaders who have backed Clarke, and the promise of 350 new jobs, over Goncalves' effort to secure the ore but create no new jobs in Nashwauk. Goncalves has threatened to litigate against the state for access to state ore at the Nashwauk site and has threatened to move any expansion of his company to Michigan rather than Minnesota if he loses the battle for the Nashwauk ore.Meanwhile, Clarke has reached out to ArcelorMittal, the majority owner in HIbbing Taconite, in an effort to broker a deal so both firms could have the ore they need.Ohio pig iron project advancingClarke last year announced a partnership with Republic Steel to make pig iron using his Minnesota iron ore at a new facility in Lorain, Ohio. Officials from both companies in recent weeks said that project continues to progress. Most of that ore will come from Clarke's ERP Compliant Iron Ore, the former Magnetation operations in Grand Rapids. ERP has been shipping already-processed iron ore concentrate to Mexico via rail in recent weeks.Republic and ERP formed Lorain Pig Iron and said they have retained ""technical service providers"" to study recommissioning Republic's blast furnace 4 in Lorain. LPI said it expects to begin producing pig iron with Minnesota ore in Lorain before the end of this year.http://bit.ly/2GbyGcV",

China tariffs GM 25% on their autos, India tariffs 100% on Harley Davidsons, the list goes on and on. Tariffs are used by every country on the planet. Step back and ask, why can the previous president apply a 500% tariff on certain steels from China and nearly no mention of it anywhere, not here, not in the news, not from world leaders, But the current president follows in principle the rulings from world leaders, EU particularly but not limited to just them, of limiting Chinese steel by tariffs? Is it because the EU, India, and the like refuse to address the underlying problem? Does China really need 1.02 billion tons of steel? China barely uses half. Where does the other 500 million ton go? The US uses the 2nd most steel at ~150 million ton. 350 million ton is being peppered all over the world and only recently have the world nations started taking up the charge of limiting imports of Chinese steel. That charge is a slugs pace in January on the lakes of Minnesota. Just very curious of all the screaming when other countries are doing it too but they haven't gotten to the illness of the symptoms. Current president cuts to the heart of the matter and stops global dumping of China by limiting all imports with a tariff. If the countries that are crying don't like it, they should do the same to the dumping of imports into their country, which they are trying to.  Maybe that might save their Steel Industry also. The EU has been saying as much for quite some time and only now are doing something about it. The ripple effect if all are on board, is that China will stop globally dumping steel at unfair values. Does anyone not think that China isn't considering the impact of follow up tariffs to the hundreds of billions of dollar surplus they trade with the US each year? They are scared as their economic engine would grind to a halt as ours would be hugely impacted also. Neither country will let this happen. Saber rattling and the world will go on",

"I thought this was a great article. But two questions bother me about a possible acquistion 1) How does declaring a dividend make them more attractive to a potential acquirer? 2) How does inking a long term deal with Amazon make them more likely to be acquired? If I were about to get bought I would use the dividend money to pay down debt, or buy back shares. I wouldn't give it out in a dividend.",
I have no idea and I asked my trading desk and they were unsure. I bought some in the money September calls to play the acquisition trade and bought the B shares because they were cheaper. My presumption is that both shares get the same value if acquired. Not sure.,

"Q3 earnings seemed fine. What am I missing? LGF made money, paid down debt ahead of schedule, even initated a dividend(which I didnt agree with would have prefered more debt reduction).  Company wisely spreads out their risk on individual films so while they do have failures they also have had some real successes like Wonder and La La Land recently so risk/reward is agruably pretty good here.  They will not blow their brains out on some huge Disney type production that bombs but can do very well with a sleeper seems to be a strategy that works.",
Hasbro should try again but buyout their film division.,
"Do you ever notice that LGF has consistently posted pretax losses almost every quarter for years except the one quarter when they had a non-recurring gain on asset sale of their Epix interest? Why do you not adjust your calculations for non recurring items and income tax benefits that skew true earnings performance? The 3Q ended 12/31/17 was not a strong operating earnings quarter. Positive earnings were totally the result of tax benefits.Why do you not mention the absurdity of LGF's $450+ million of annual G&A expenses that are about 3x what they should be for a studio its size? Huge reductions in these bloated expenses are the primary acquisition play.Why do you keep saying that the fundamentals of LGF's business are strong given the huge G&A issues and 1) they have not posted recurring pre tax profits for years, 2) over 80% of their feature films are box office failures because their content evaluation metrics are deeply flawed, 3) they have had one huge failure after another on major franchise possibilities that were suppose to fill huge ""The Hunger Games"" earnings void, 4) their TV business earnings are not growing, 5) Starz is increasingly vulnerable to Netflix and the new Disney/Fox streaming services, 6) They are investing large amounts of capital in new content for Starz even though LGF has demonstrated no consistent ability to acquire and/or develop feature film, cable, satellite or TV content that produces strong earnings and 7) management is trying to sell this hype elevated house of cards so they can cash out their equity interests and cash in on golden parachutes.

"Tom, I'm impressed by the extent and depth of your knowledge about the mining business. Why don't you write some articles? I would love to hear what companies you would recommend. Thanks.",
"It might be a bit unfair to compare Santa Elena as it exists today to Las Chispas. Santa Elena was a virgin deposit so it had some advantages; even though it sounds like having existing (old) workings would be better, often the opposite may be true. Also Santa Elena has a significant open pit component that made the project more robust allowing the old SilverCrest to finance at the bottom of the cycle and be CF positive and debt free very quickly. Ore sourced from the open pit is lower grade but also much lower cost. Santa Elena is mainly mined in one area and does not involve a bunch of small resource satellite deposits (though some will probably be mined in the future) or stopes spread out throughout the mine, again this is better from an economic standpoint. The main thing Las Chispas has at this point is the grades, they are very good and the project is nice, hardly ""world class"" though and the shares aren't cheap. A premium is probably justified because Eric Fier is the man but November 2017 would have been the buying opportunity in retrospect as starting in August they had some superb drill results. I didn't see anybody writing an article about it here back then. The easier double has been made, the next one will be more difficult.",
"Las Chispas is a nice project but Silvercrest is still a one horse operation compared to First Majestic, a company with five operating silver mines and a sixth in development, 500M oz silver reserves and resources.

"A large expense for the audit is expected and discounted.  Further, the company is flush with cash and can easily handle such a one-time expense.  Way more important for valuation is to understand the growth rate of the cloud business going forward.",
2016 and 2015 fees aren't going to be relevant... the financial reporting issues didn't come to light until 2017My quote came from a business update transcript. Global eagle only filed for the first 3 quarters of 2017 - 4th quarter still missing. Took a quick look at the 10q's and didn't see anything that disclosed the audit and bank fees for the quarters. Might only be in the 10k.http://bit.ly/2FZA7KqGo to the above link and download the Sept 14th transcript. The CFO is pegging the total fees as being 45-50M for all of 2017.,
"regarding Revenue estimates.....a large drop in 2017 revenues is unlikely because 70% of revenue mix is recurring in nature and the CEO said in a recent interview that the company didn't lose a single customer in 2017.  In addition, the recently published cash level of the company is higher than it was in 2016 which also indicates that 2017 could not have been a complete disaster.  My bet is on flat cloud biz in 2017 with single digit growth in 2018.  Given that and at current valuation, stock has significant margin of safety and considerate upside potential.",
"I have to agree with others here - Oliver's PF capitalization looks wrong. This isn't surprising, as Oliver has been dead wrong on this name for the last 10 points. Reader beware. Also, the PF year-end cash balance is mostly unchanged since '16 year end when you factor in all the financing activities. The company was previously free cash flow positive. This makes Oliver's zero revenue growth assumption look less than conservative.",

Thanks!I still feel a FCF valuation is warranted here, which of course requires some speculation w/o the official financials, but your article contains enough proforma financials that I think I can reasonably build up a separate revised FCF valuation. My gut tells me it should correlate with your assessment.I will follow up shortly with the valuation and the assumptions, as I did in a previous post a few months ago. Stay tuned.Thanks again!-C",
"Hi Oliver, good article and some really great links as well!In your valuation analysis I think you double counted the 230M convertible debt as it is already included in the $354M LT debt (source 2016 10k).Also, in your revenue estimate you assumed that $113M of activation Revenue was divested.  However, some of this revenue was retained and some was reclassified as cloud revenue and thus also retained.  I think only $50M was divested because of this sentence from the 10k:""Of the $86.8 million referenced above as 2016 Activation revenue after reclassification, roughly $50 million of these revenues related to activation assetswhich we have either sold or sunsetted, or do not plan to actively market or pursue in 2017.""Therefore, using your thought process, I think your revenue est. should be higher by $63M assuming zero growth in 2017.",

There are many on the sideline watching and waiting to enter and I don’t think they will be able to and will be forced to pay up.   I see that there is big money sitting on the side looking to buy and Crnt will rise on retail selling. Use the volatility to trade the tops and bottoms while maintaining a core long position.",
"Unfortunately the carrier-grade microwave market has been dogged for years with fierce competition worldwide, and perennially low profitability.  Probably the advent of 5G will make both problems worse, and may submerge several players including Ceragon.  The bandwidths that will be required in the urban network designs of T, VZ, and TMUS in the U.S. (and other overseas 5G carrier networks)  will incorporate, as correctly indicated in the article, both  microwave and fiber legs.  But the advent of affordable 100G and 400G fiber channels will relegate lower-bandwidth microwave to a very minor status within the network design.  And a dozen  microwave suppliers will fight for these crumbs.Meanwhile the price of microwave links has plummeted, with the incorporation of switching,  logic and RF elements mass-produced for other cell-related products.  For low bandwidth applications it is possible to buy a complete 100Mbs link  (for example the Tycon Power EZBridge) for as little as $180.  Point-to-point microwave equipment manufacturers such as Ericsson and Ceragon must weep when they see these prices.On balance 5G is probably more of a threat than an opportunity to Ceragon; meanwhile some of its legal tangles may be a put-off to any company brave enough to consider acquisition of Ceragon.",

"10 times of EBITDA of CRNT is around $323.5 million. The market cap is around $219 million which is 48% more than EBITDA. If CRNT goes up in operation and holds 5G key technology in backhaul, the valuation will be up to 20 times of EBITDA.Which means the price will be close to $10 per share.",

When Kmi took them private they had a large amount of private equity. Little debt was used. To take it private the board would have to listen to valuations. The valuation firms would put the range from 2.30-2.40 cents per cash flow. This is the 2.05 today plus some discount on the 12b in backlog projects.At 2.30-2.40 times 12-15 times you get 28-36 a share. That would mean total equity needed is 56-72b. No group of equity firms would do that right now. If Kmi management tried to get it cheaper the board puts themselves at risk for huge shareholder lawsuits for trying to get the company on the cheap.,
Kmi acquires El Paso. Not the other way around.,
"Another reason I think this is a terrible stock to short: potential for insiders to take private again.  Assuming they offered $20 per share and contributed their 15% of the company, ~$37B would be needed.  Kinder has shown a willingness in the past to lever up, taking a BB- credit rating when he took KMI private in 2007.  That would imply to me they could take ~$15B of debt and would need about a $22B investment from Hedge funds / partners.  Assuming insiders wanted to double their stake to 30% in exchange for the risk of the added leverage, $22B would buy investors 70% of the company.  Then, they could stop dividends and work to delever back down towards 5.0- 5.5x over 5 years (1-1.5 billion debt pay down per year plus expected growth up to $9B EBITDA would accomplish this).  IPO into a better market at that point could yield a huge payoff at that point.  The more I think about this, the more I wonder why this hasn’t occurred yet!",
"Time to taper the capex with the stock at $16ish and start buying back shares.

They have hedged 70% of prodution in 2018 at 56 or higher. They have hedged 30% of production in the high 50s for 2019. As 2019 approaches they will hedge most of that production.For every $1 drop in oil below $56 (which is their budget number) the cash flow is reduced by $6mm. So even if oil drops to $40 cash flow is reduced by about $100mm. The 2018 budget had built in $600mm excess after the .80 cent dividend and the 2.2b in capital growth projects.The dividend is not at risk as it was in 2015.As previous posters said they have a 2.6 coverage ratio.,

The company plans to increase its dividend to $1 per share in 2019 and $1.25 per share in 2020, as well as to implement a $2 billion share buyback program. CEO Richard Kinder declared himself ""highly confident"" that the company will meet those goals.”Long KMIBest",

"KMI is the complete dog of this sector. While other large cap pipeline companies are doing nothing but rapidly growing cashflows after the hiccup, KMI is just plain stuck in the mud as even 2018 guidance indicates almost dead flat cashflow. Leverage is still over 5x and even guided to be over 5x by the end of 2018. While you have waited over the last 3yrs you have earned almost nothing in distributions. This thing has been terrible. I've been critical of this company for 3 straight years on various SA threads. Yet even I am starting to get interested at $16. To be short this thing at this price you better be hoping you get a hail mary and they were either cooking the books or just have a bunch of old pipelines that don't serve todays needed transportation routes.",
"Believe this is misguided... KMI base business is finally stabilizing and drag from deleveraging is coming to an end.  2018 growth is slight because there is still some drag from 2017 asset sales, but 2019 will be a clean window.  $160MM of preferred stock dividends go away too as that $1.6B gets converted to common at about $27/share in October.  Elba startup mid year 2018... by my calcs possible that DCF/share will be $2.20+ with leverage dropping slightly.  At a reasonable 10x multiple (still low compared to peers) the shares should be worth $22.  Upside to that possible.  If TMEP goes through, by 2021 you could see DCF $2.75ish per share, leverage 4.5x, dividend $1.5-$2.00, share price???  Should be a rerating if shares to peer multiple 12x to DCF, implying $33/share",
Trump will give Canadian exemption on tarrifs... probably be tweet over weeken.,
"For the record:  If and when KML does build the TMEP in CANADA, the new TRUMP steel tariffs DO NOT APPLY inside Canada for Canadian companies.........so today's selling of KMI is being done for other emotional reasons.......and even if the TMEP did some how have to pay higher steel prices, the added cost is only $175 million on a $5.5 billion US Dollar cost basis....annoying, but not very relevant.",

Commitment of traders futures indicates a large decline in oil is coming. Producers were selling around 550k contracts July 2014 as oil was 100+ a barrel. Ironically Large Speculators or hedge funds were at record amount of long contracts at 440k total. We then crashed shortly after.  To put this in retrospect now the current figures shows Commercials who are the producers selling 799k oil contracts and hedge fund buying 777k contracts. Something is going to give here as the amount of selling contracts by producers who really control the market long term are up by 45%. To me producers needs to pump as much as they can to pay the bankers. Wall street just has leverages bets on bets and when they unwind look out. The CFTC is not always accurate though. Keep in mind this is only on Crude Oil and not Nat Gas but those markets can tend to correlate. We are pointing to a retest of the energy lows we had a few years back and Kinder will go with it.,
"My last thought until one year from now.  The Baltic Dry Index for vessels, extremely high prices being charged brought on way to many ships and shipping companies go bankrupt.  Oil prices high, rigs are financed.  Oil prices drop causing bankruptcies in the industry.  Lots of articles about way too much capacity to carry natural gas (too many pipelines which will lower prices).  Same story different industry.  So, we will see what happens.",
"A very interesting debate, as always, about KMI.My long term investments in midstream companies, especially KMI, before and during the start of the shale oil fracking boom was financially crucial for a few of my family members last years in nursing homes. For that, I will always feel lucky to have been invested in KMI. Unfortunately I got greedy, stayed in a bit too long and got hit hard on some of my investment.That said, as most of us long term KMI investors found out, RK got it very wrong and had to do what his people ultimately forced him to do to save the Co. Cut the dividend, deleverage the business and basically start over by correctly running a pipeline company the way it should be run. I believe RK has stated that fact. He also understood, when he made the decision to move KMI in a new direction, that it would take several years to get the mistakes made whole again, much less regain trust from investors.IMHO it is now time to get additional funds invested in KMI while the price is reasonable( under $17) before Wall Street wakes up to what strides KMI has made.Long KMI.",
"10-K page 82, published 2/9/2018 on Kinder Morgan's website.  Go to the 10-K, look at Kinder Morgan's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow (it shows the year 2017, 2016, and 2015).  Three main categories Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, Net Cash Used in Investing Activities, and Cash Flows from Financing Activities.  Look at the Financing Activities.  Issuance of Debt, Payments of Debt, Cash Dividends, Contributions from non controlling interests - net proceeds from KML IPO (Note 3).  And their you go.  Please be specific on your response on the facts, I would like to look it up, if I am mistaken.",
I stated facts your are wrong. They invested the proceeds of stock offerings to finish capital projects not to pay dividends as you suggest. They ipo the Canadian pipeline and used the proceeds to pay down debt.They sold billions in assets to pay down debt and those assets were replaced by the capital they spent thus the flat ebitda.The ebitda is net of interest 4.4b. They paid 1.1b in dividends and 3.0b in growth cap ex in 2017.The ebitda for 2018 is 4.5b. They will spend 1.7b in dividends 2.2b in growth cap ex and have 600mm to buy back stock.Tell me how that is issuing stock and debt to pay dividends. Oh wait it’s not.,
You are correct PAA is in the same boat (not a different boat).,
"I don't understand why you say a ""finance guy"" and think finance doesn't apply to your sector of the world?  Finance applies to all sectors with a few differences in regulated industries.  GE had a mountain of debt look what has happened.  Large amounts of debt compared to what can be afforded, is a deep hole not very many companies survive. You are claiming debt doesn't apply in the pipeline business. Are pipelines a regulated business?  Did i miss that? Is their competition? Did I miss that?  Yes, I am a finance guy. You got me.  Let us compare notes one year from now and see where Kinder Morgan stands.  Thank you for the cute complement also, it was a very nice touch.",

"What facts from the financials did you bring to the table?  What page of the financials are you looking at?  Auditors can confirm debt.  Their purpose is not the recommendation of investments.  Hopefully, you don't think Auditors are approving your investment, they are signing up for what the financials say.  Back on the facts though, where were yours again, I am confused.  Thank you for clarifying in advance.  OK, one more thing, I am not short or long, I liked the article so I did some research on my own, to see if the author's comments were on the straight.  Be very afraid when ""everyone"" is agreeing with you (supply and demand - everyone invested is already invested - no more buyers left, only sellers).",
I guess the shorts have to panic people into selling. The company spent the capital to replace the income they lost from sale of assets. How else could they have paid over 6b in debt in 18 months.If Kmi is a ponzi play how come the auditors and just about every analyst isn’t agreeing with you.Please get the facts straight before you publish or respond.,
"These financial statements are very sad, almost funny.  I forgot to mention how the $1.1 billion in dividends were ""financed"" last year.  Net proceeds of $1.2 billion from KML IPO (see Note 3) in the 10-K.",
Is there any reason to read such an ill-informed hit job?,
"No one should call a company that is leveraged like this an investment.  It is a massive leverage play.  Most people call massive leverage plays options or futures.  People should understand the difference.  Funny comments above.  A 211 page 10-K in itself discourages people from looking to find the balance sheet let alone what is really going on with the financials.  2017, 2016, 2015 any guesses at the actual debt pay down combined for the three years?  $4.4 billion but issuance of $5.4 billion in common stock and convertible preferred.  Never trust what management is saying but what they are doing.  I don't know why people believe so much about what is being said instead of what is happening, just look at the numbers.  Anyhow pretty good article.  OK one more thing about how their ""capital investments"" have been performing.  Let us see, net investing of $5.7 billion in 2015 and operational cash flow drops by $0.7 billion not good.  Next year, 2016 can get a little confusing with the sale of an asset but.....not good.  2017....",

Here is another way to look at KMI. Would anyone care to bet money that Kinder is really going to set div at .81 or more and then to 1.01 or more. (In other words higher than what was stated)? Probably no one. It a takes either a long time to build trust or a lot of new suckers.,

KM has 70% of their debt as long term fixed at below 5%. They float 30%. Their debt is 36.6b. So floating debt is about 10b. A 1% rise in rates increases interest expense 100mm a year not your 380mm a year.You short guys turn facts around to scare people. Trump would call you fake news.,

I’m ok with reading bearish articles about my long positions (everyone should to get a different perspective) but it’s clear to me that this author is not at all familiar with KMI and the dynamics that have been occurring the last couple of years.  The second poster above spells it out very nicely so I won’t rehash it again.It’s very dangerous to short a company that you have done such a poor job researching and understanding.,
"From reading the most recent investor presentation...even if KMI's plans all go...to plan....will the company be able to grow 12+% per year? The numbers they guide to do not really suggest so. Many investors (myself included) are after more than just an increased dividend.I'm underwater as I bought around $20 a couple of years ago, but I'm getting frustrated with the lack of evidence this company will provide 12%++ returns. I'm very tempted to sell and reallocate to a renewable-based energy company in transition such as FSLR which I think may have much more potential over the next couple of decades.I certainly would not short KMI, but I am definitely considering selling my long position and reinvesting elsewhere.Looking forward to thoughts.",
"I'm with you.  While I won't take the risk of shorting KMI, there's no way I'd ever invest in it.  Your article correctly points out ""Too much leverage, subpar management, a low dividend yield for the sector, weak trading momentum and patterns, plus heightened risk from rising interest rates"" in addition to projects that may never come to fruition and no guarantee that oil prices will grow much in 2018.  The gullible can buy KMI and I'll stay long in EPD, BPL, PBFX, OKE and GLOP.",
Your FCF # includes growth capex. Less growth = more debt paydown.,
No mention of the dividend increases planned for 2018-2020 beginning in May. I assume this article was written by a short term trader.,
"I'm sorry to read that you are going to go broke shorting KMI.Just a few thoughts:1. You talk about the low yield, but KMI is going to raise its dividend to 80 cents per share this coming quarter, $1 per share next year, and $1.25 per share the following year. If you are short the shares, you are going to have to pay for that.2. You talk about KMI's excessive leverage, but don't seem to connect the fact that its lack of earnings growth has been driven by its efforts to deleverage its portfolio - something that it has been quite successful in doing.3. The backdrop for midstream companies is quite good. Virtually all midstream companies are trading at the same place they were when oil prices were much lower. The synchronized world-wide recovery is really good for energy volumes. If you have been following the energy business, you also know that Shell has just reported its concern that there is a significant world wide shortage of LNG. This bodes well for American gas pipelines in that U.S. consumption of natural gas is growing and so are exports.4. KMI is really dirt cheap. Yes, people don't trust management. But that is already reflected in the prices.One could make the case that it would be wiser to pay up for a company with a better operating reputation such as EPD or even WMB. But shorting any midstream company right now suggests that a person has more confidence than experience. First, the person shorting these companies has to pay the dividends; and, Second, these investments can rip when institutional investors shift to looking for value rather than growth. In the past, when midstream companies end their downturn they frequently go up by 35% in one year and 60 to 75% in two.Rather than shorting these companies, longterm investors should be buying them while they're so cheap.Best wishes,Davidlong KMI, WMB",
"While I expect the title of this article is just click-bait, I have to comment.Good luck with that short and a $10 price target.  In sixty days the dividend will be $.80, and a year from now it will be $1.00.  Pretty sure $10 is out of question unless we have a 2009-style financial crisis.",Kinder Morgan: Is There Any Reason To Own It?

Could be $250 a share, or could be $3,000 a share .  No one knew AMZN would have grown the way it has 15 years ago.  BABA is very popular outside the US.

"BABA is expanding its revenue into different businesses. Overtime, the value of company will be appreciated as well even though it is getting into online to offline business which has lower margin business model. Alibaba's online to offline model is innovated with technology, not the same to traditional brick-and-mortar store. Also, the majority of revenue in offline for China is roughly 80% versus 20% of online. This is big revenue for capturing over the long term. For investor with patience, stock price of BABA can easily becom $1000/share in about 10-15 years.  This was how Amazon's stock price went up tremendously in the past 20 years.  Amazon's revenue now has control of online market in North America.",

Wasn’t it about 4-5years ago that every analyst on here was saying Amazon was a money-losing operation that wouldn’t last?  It did take a long time to make a profit though.,
Alibaba succeeds against more competition than Amazon does in the US and could easily enter the US and just hit Amazon on price by not having infrastructure. I doubt they will do that because my political sense tells me the Chinese don't really want their big companies taking major positions in the US. One who did so recently suddenly lost his job.

"You've laid a good case for Alibab as an investment. However, strictly coming from a customer point of view, I'm just curious about Alibaba servicing a North American market. The whole basic point, for me anyway, of Amazon is to shop for certain items and to get it delivered quickly backed up by what I think is the best customer service around. When I go to Alibaba it remains very China/Asia-centric and their products seems to be focused on 'bulk purchases'. It doesn't provide (unless that's not their business model particularly when it comes to North America) the same customer experience at all as Amazon. Then there's the whole trust factor. When I purchase from Amazon, I trust Amazon (and eBay for that matter) will deliver it and if something goes wrong they will make good on it. Not sure how Alibaba is going to match this.

"Elliot, I agree with your assessment.. Too many day trader/short sellers to take most articles seriously if your not one of those types.",
"There is no universal appropriate course of conduct with respect to MMLP. If one wants a 14.5% tax deferred yield with 1x coverage and 5x leverage and is willing to sacrifice near term growth, one would have a different course of conduct than an investor seeking a lower and safer yield and growth. Commentators tend to reflect their own investment goals as universal solutions when that is not appropriate.   Elliot Miller",
Basically they are sand bagging guidance so they can beat the guidance 2-4% and seem like heroes maybe its better to down play guidance and beat it rather get over optimistic and not make it??  as for new management this is a family run business so without an activist we are stuck with most of the top management.,
they should drop the distribution 33% have great coverage and reenter the books as a solid player and pay debt down,
"Seldom I disagree with you LP. Was working on MMLP article as first attempt on SA. Guess I need to finish it. I think it is a question of macro-economics. Petro related goods being destocked means lower revenues near term. If overall economy continues to grow then MMLP flourishes, but there is going to be some pain first. I see that as buying opportunity.",

Easier to buy VERI in future, meanwhile let them do the grunt work.  I wouldn't over simplify what VERI is doing, it is quite complex. Learning curve is quite steep as well.  That is why I think their margins are safe for quite sometime.",

"New to this thread, and DRAM investing in general, but have traded this name on and off for many years. Never considered this stock as suitable for longer term investing....until now. With DRAM densities continuing to climb, the day when you will be able to run your entire operating system in RAM, along with all your applications, is quickly approaching. Yes, I know, you can already do that with a server motherboard, but, before long, even a generic PC motherboard will give you that capability. They're getting close now.When that day arrives, DRAM demand will go through the roof. Could realistically happen at 7nm, I suspect. I know for my own machines I already run 32GB of RAM and periodically allocate 20GB as a RAM Drive for Video Editing.That sort of shift should usher in a huge wave of demand for a pc refresh cycle, along with the accompanying astronomical demand for DRAM.We could be at the very beginning of a DRAM super cycle that could last for several years.

Cramer is now out in full force talking about MU trying to be the expert and claiming credit.  Move on!!!,
Hopefully we can all enjoy this and brag a little...I think we deserve it....so I'll just give myself a shout out on all those April $45 calls I was buying and still own all of them. Think some longstanding commenters were in on that same trade.,
Wonder what the shorts are thinking.,
Why does the author not own MU?,
INCREDIBLE! Thank You $47.50 3/9 CALLS!! Woo HOOOOOO!!,
What a day.,
we even have cramer on the bandwagon now....jimmy loves mu !,
Its pretty much like clockwork every quarter....the money comes piling into this stock a few weeks before earnings.,
Look at that volumes!!!!,
and dont be surprised if some big company offers to buy mu for about 120 per share....which we should vote no ..because thats to low,

the article got it wrong imo. Volune is created by institutions not avg Joe. when mu broke out above double bottom pivot 46.98 it came on sub par volume. then we have a high volume down day suggesting institutional selling. the stock held above 47 so that's good for longs. but there wasn't much buying in the breakout n follow thru. there was big boy selling today.,
The sizable lower wick on a down day very often leads to a positive trading session the next day for Micron.   No idea why this is the case.,

People are crazy to be wary of buying micron stock. They will report earnings of greater than 3 dollars a share this quarter. and the stock will double before the year is out.

I wish Chairman Powell would testify to Congress more often as I attribute the drop this morning to the uncertainty the FED creates.

"I just bought more. Patience will be rewarded. Once San Antonio is operational, they will be able to start paying down their debt in a significant manner. The stock pattern is quite erratic. In the last year, it had three clear attempts to climb to $10, each time dropped around current levels. At an EV of about $450M; with an expected EBITDA of $120M (adjusted downwards following train-related mishaps), it is hard not to see compelling value. With oil now firmly back above $60, and knowing that sand price contracts typically have WTI-related adjustments, I am a firm believer of having a significant margin of safety, despite the high debt levels.",
Bag holding but I see much skies aheadbritghter  brighter,
The planned excess capacity of in-basin 100 mesh in the Permian confirmed this morning by FMSA's management team on their CC does point to the strategic value of going for the EF instead of the Permian...I honestly did not see $6.85 as a possibility with oil still above $60 and global markets near all time highs...this is very cheap...,
"They have been announcing a partnership for more than the past six months...in the last CC, they finally unveiled a bit more by saying they would make some sort of partnership with SOI with the San Antonio mine. Not quite sure why only the San Antonio mine? But that is the only thing we have to go by...it would indeed be good. In terms of relative valuation, SOI could almost buy EMES and then secure its access to sand, a bit like what TUSK did in the last few years...but I am not sure how the market would reward this for SOI...",
"That would indeed be a very nice analysis. I rarely see it done on SA in this space. But that would indeed put to rest some of the fears out there. The lack of major capex needs for HCLP is really its advantage right now. The OCF can freely flow to FCF and not be eaten up by massive capex needs.SOI, Solaris, just announced very strong results. Yet another data point that the demand for sand is through the roof in North America. Rail issues is also plaguing Canadian oil producers who need to ship to the US their oil due to a lack of pipeline capacity. These bottlenecks are a real problem, but a nice one to have I guess...",
"Nice article, thanks.  What I think would have really improved it is if you did a cash flow model for the next 2-3 years, showing how their balance sheet would transform as they completed their capex, started selling sand at the various production levels, and paid off debt at opportunistic times.  I think it would more credibly demonstrate that/if this little MLP will not only survive under likely scenarios, but thrive and upon resumption of a distribution, potentially soar.",
"They probably wouldn't but $10 a share would be hard to resist. They got themselves in this pickle with extremely poor disclosure to the market. They have been talking about a partnership with SOI for the last mile since Q2's CC last summer. Now they mention they might partner with them once San Antonio has reached their first major capacity hurdle. Not impressed. Worse, promise an EBITDA of $140-$160 reiterated three times, last time in January...then a significant cut back to $120M...why reiterate the initial range when the problems were well known already in January? Again, not impressed. Valuation is dirt cheap. The whole sector got under a giant cloud after the ""big short"" of Dan Loeb last year. I am sure he has moved on since but the negativity remains. The dramatic drop from $10 to $7 is completely overdone if one believes they are only affected in the short-run by these issues. But they need to instill confidence and missing forecasts is not the way to go. At this point, either a peer or a major upstream producer should consider buying them. The assets are there, and they will be in demand for years to come...I will add below $7, to cheap to ignore.",
"Devious business idea: EOG buys EMES for $500M (30% premium for the equity, including debt). Short change for them. Guarantees fracking sand for them, in particular in EF with the largest leasehold position and jacks up prices $20 per ton for everybody else in the play overnight for everything not yet contracted out. Brilliant, no?",

"As long as they are making lots of money and their product is in very high demand, i am not worried about shareprice. they will follow sooner or later.",
I meant mines not wells of course!,
"Well, some of those mines are well on the way. For instance, Atlas, private operator. And SLCA and FMSA both have big Permian wells coming online. But EMES is going to be the king of the EagleFord. Really low valuation assuming somehow only a short time in the sun...shale demand for sand should give a multi year stream of revenues. Prices keep increasing. In basin supply is relevant for Permian, but it is beyond necessary in order to meet the crazy high demand. Buy low.",
"Regarding supply: What is the rationale for someone investing in a new sand mine, when you can invest in one of four or five publicly traded companies for pennies on the dollar? (two to five times cash flow)? The risks are lower and payback period is incredibly shorter. As Buffet says compare the value on wall street with main street. If that would be the case in this industry, no one in their right mind would start a new sand mine.  Seems to me the energy sector fosters a lot illogical investment decisions--but I'm a novice in this area.",
You cannot ignore lower commodity prices as a third risk to be considered for the short to medium term. They promote selling and shorting of wide baskets of stocks in the E&P and Oil Services sectors and make it difficult to gather momentum.,
Information seems to be anecdotal at best for now but what are y'alls projections for when the sand market become over supplied?  My best guess would be 2Q of next year at the very earliest.  Is there any reason to believe that it could happen sooner than that?  I'm trying to figure out how long I can hold EMES... I think eventually sand will become too commoditized.Thoughts?,
Agreed - highly undervalued and continues to become more undervalued as I write this!!,
"Agreed this is drastically undervalued and if they execute could be a multibagger  in next 12-18months. Sentiment is so bad today on everything oil related especially sand, but should shift. Crazy this stock traded over $100 a few years back.",
"What the market is missing is EBITDA was $18.6 million, and available cash for distribution - this quarter $14 million, or $0.43 per share.  Though management is using the money to finish Texas, when that ramps the cash will be available.Back-of-the-napkin analysis is 75% of EBITDA is available, for the year $120 of EBITDA = $90 million available for distribution, take off an additional 25% for a ""fudge factor"" (very conservative) = $67.5 to be end-of-year loaded = $2.25 per share.  Assuming an 8% - 10% yield, the stock price should hit $22.50 - $28 -- and if Canadian railway pulls their heads out, and Texas permits 4 million tons, add another $0.50 in distributions, and $5 - $6 per share = $27.50 - $34  !!!""In conclusion"" we have 3x to 4x of probable upside (as long as Trump's action today does not start a trade war and slow the global economies).",Emerge Energy Services: Economic Factors Indicate Deep Value

"Out today, and SA has up in PRsThis is big positive news:SAN DIEGO, March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(ADMP) (“Adamis”) today provided an update on data from its presentation entitled “Human Factors Study of A Newly Approved Epinephrine Prefilled Syringe (Symjepi) for the Emergency Treatment of Allergic Reactions (Type I) Including Anaphylaxis”.  The presentation took place at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) joint congress with the World Allergy Organization in Orlando, Florida on March 3, 2018.  Excerpts from the presentation’s Abstract were as follows:Introduction: Epinephrine remains the treatment of choice for acute anaphylaxis. However, currently available auto-injectors are costly, and studies have demonstrated human factor issues resulting in incorrect use (lacerations) as well as device failures. Correct auto-injector use has been noted to be as low as 20% in some studies. A recently FDA approved prefilled syringe of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis (Symjepi™) was examined in a prospective human factors validation study in order to determine the likelihood that the product would be used safely and effectively by intended users.  Methods:  A total of 82 participants were enrolled in this prospective study including adults with and without epinephrine injector experience, adolescents with and without epinephrine injector experience, and lay caregivers with and without epinephrine injector experience. Half of the participants in each user group were trained to use Symjepi™ prior to first use in the study. Critical tasks that could cause harm and compromise the successful use of epinephrine were assessed and included five categories: Open the case (I), retrieve prefilled syringe (II), remove needle cap (III), insert needle in the thigh (IV), press plunger until it stops (V).Results: 100 % (82/82) of participants were able to complete task I. 100% (82/82) of participants completed task II. 100% (82/82) were able to complete task III. 93% (77/82) completed task IV and 99% (81/82) completed task V. Dr. Ronald Moss, Chief Medical Officer at Adamis and a Fellow of AAAAI stated, “Human factor studies are important to support the safe and effective use of epinephrine devices used in the treatment of anaphylaxis.  This prospective human factor study for this epinephrine device supports the ease and correct use of Symjepi™ for the acute treatment of anaphylaxis. Symjepi™ is a newly approved epinephrine syringe for the treatment of anaphylaxis and should provide a good cost-effective user-friendly alternative to current auto-injectors.”",

BTW, a little outfit called Teva is still moving forward with an Epi product using an Antares injector.  They have had some stumbles with the FDA, but I'd definitely put them on the competition watch list... ONLY HOPE FOR ADAMIS IS PARTNERING  Symjepi.  Until then, the company is going nowhere -- pipeline is just a dream and no use discussing or investing in this company...unless you're a bagholder like me...ATVB,Don",

"A good call back in 2010, congratulations. Travelers will benefit from the tax cuts, as mentioned on the last conference call. The analysis is easy, and increases estimated intrinsic value. The bond portfolio has less BIG than any insurer I'm aware of. In addition, average maturity is somewhat earlier than the maturity of their claim liability. So they will be able to put the money from expiring bonds to work at higher rates as this situation develops, and they will never have to sell bonds before they mature. The stock trades well below my estimate of intrinsic value, and I am waiting patiently for a re-entry point. This stock is a favorite of mine for LEAPS covered calls: long by means of deep in the money, distant expiration calls, and short covered calls out of the money.",
"What did Buffett say his favourite holding period is?   ..... Oh, yeah ...""FOREVER"". My cost basis on TRV is about $7.25. I plan to hold it, -- and hope to be able to hold it, -- until my death.",
"True ROE (which I think makes more sense to use for financials than ROIC) has declined, but look at interest rates over the last four years.  TRV has had to reinvest maturing bonds at lower rates.  TRV is now beginning to benefit from rising rates.  It just seems to me that selling TRV at what could very well be a cyclical low in terms returns on capital seems to contradict your strategy of investing in companies that have the potential to improve profitability in future periods.",
"This article lacks even the most basic analysis of TRV's business.Yes, ROE declined in 2017, but this was due primarily to catastrophe losses (hurricanes in Texas/Florida, Mexico City earthquakes, California fires, etc.).Due to heavy cat losses in 2017, it's reasonable to expect pricing to improve in FY18.  That combined with increasing interest rates which will increase investment income on TRV's massive bond portfolio should result in higher OP in FY18.  Now, that assumes more subdued cat losses in FY18, but the nature of the insurance industry is that there will be really good years and really bad years (the timing of which is unpredictable).  That's why if you want to invest in P&C insurers you really should commit to holding for several years.",Position Close Update: The Travelers Companies
"""It will take a little longer to receive approval, but that doesn't matter as long as it is eventually able to tap into the large RRMS market.""I don't believe I'm taking this quote out of context, in fact it seems to be the main premise of your article.  Timing of introduction of any blockbuster drug absolutely DOES matter, and in the case of ozanimod there are nuances making the timing even more critical.  Delay of expected revenue changes the value of any security due to the time-value of money.  It affects the present value calculation of the stock's worth.  It's more critical for ozanimod because it shortens the sweetspot - the time between its' introduction and expiration of the Gilenya patent.  I do agree that in the long term CELG will recover from this.  There is not enough information yet (we don't know how long the ozanimod delay will be) to determine whether the recent selloff was overdone.  Based on over reaction we've seen for other companies with unexpected bad news, it probably was.  People tend to assume the worst, especially with recent overall market volatility.",

"buying oppertunity for celgene. this is logistical stuff and FDA asserting its position in management of new offerings. long CELG, anything under 90 is a buy IMO.",
"agree, herd people with simpleton view say buy from 147 right to today and they have nice roses glasses on and don’t have much money",
"What CELG is trying to do, is prepare for $s to come in when Revlimid goes generic.They are desperate only because the day the product goes generic it will lose 90% of sales at the end of year 1.It is not a biologic. Several player can and will jump in. We know that in the olden days thalidomide cost was 7 cents a day. Linalidamide structure and molecule is not too far Thalidomide.Ideally Celgene is hoping to have their top line not drop when Revlimid goes generic.Ozanimod for M.S. was a very good opportunity to have a product with high price and can quickly rev up sales.I see this as a big set back for Celgene.",
maybe in a year or two complete waste of time they completely dropped the ball cheap at 95 then 90 until they make a meaningful bottom avoid value trap,
"The analysis is pure speculation. Small stuff can be resolved during NDA review. Having both preclinical and clinical deficiencies strongly suggests FDA asks for a lot more work by Celgene. Many of the senior people that made Celgene the new Merck have retired. It is the loss of folks not known to the average analyst but known to us who have worked in the industry is what the analysis does not take into account, IMO.",
I own CELG  but done with this mgmt.,
"FYI only 47 RTFs since 2011. 47 % failed to get approval. And this one is worse bec mgmt counted it as part of their 19/20 revs abt 400 mil. The drug has competition and loses exclusivity in 2019 which means the drug will bring in 150 in 2019 if at all. This drug was acquired via buy out.The problem is how can you trust an inept management that failed on an imp Crohn disease drug, guided meaningfully lower  and then now this, messing up on a FDA app. Seriously! How good are the Juno and Impact buyouts if you cant deliver on them! Mgmt needs to go or activist coming. Carl must be licking his fingers and maybe getting in this dog",
just a matter of crossing some i's and dotting some t's. and then they will give the form back to fda,
"While it's theoretically possible Celgene can get Ozanimod through the goal-line in the US, I wonder if it will actually be worth it. To think they could capture 20% of the MS market by 2026 is fantasy.  With a delay potentially putting launch after Gilenya loss of exclusivity, I would think they'd need to take a hard look at their real sales potential in the US given the continued intense competition for patients and increasing scrutiny by payors.",
"Excellent analysis. In recent years, the FDA, under pressure to review drugs on a timely basis. has made increasing use of RTFs, seemingly based on a lower threshold for issuing one. The FDA tacitly acknowledged this last May, when it withdrew its 1993 guidance about RTFs. It issued a draft of new guidance in December 2017. Thus, receiving an RTF in 2018 may be much less of a cause for alarm than in the past. Celgene's management clearly believes this is the case.",Can Celgene's Ozanimod Survive After FDA Blowback?

I wonder how much jet fuel was burned (along with the cash) to fly the batteries to Australia. Let alone Elon's private jet trips there for photo ops with politicians.

All in the service of saving the world by reducing fossil fuel consumption right?,

"When Tesla added the third shift in the second half of 2017, there was no increase in production. Removing the shift would appear to have had little affect on the downside. There is in fact no evidence from the S and X production numbers, that there ever was a third shift implemented. Tesla games the numbers as and when needed. It is that simple. Ace I am on record estimating non-employee and insider sales of the model 3 at below 40,000 units for 2018. So far my estimates are the gold standard.",
"dhatheway,The cover story is that they pulled the personnel to concentrate on the Model 3 production ramp.  This is of course BS, it is to cover for the loss of demand for the S and X.  That is why they are projecting  only 100k production even though with 2 shifts they can do more than that.  It actually makes sense to cut to 2 shifts though, no one runs 3 shifts for long unless necessary, there are things that need done daily on the lines to keep them running efficiently.",
"There seems to be a significant difference in sales estimates between this article and Anton Wahlman's article.  https://seekingalpha.c...While this article assumes a 24,000 Model S and Model X production rate, Mr. Walhman's article suggests 23,000 iff Tesla miraculously doubles its January and February sales for the month of March.  My understanding is that Tesla reduced the number of shifts producing Model Ss and Model Xs from three down to two.  Since Tesla probably didn't manage to increase the rate those remaining two shifts could produce vehicles at by 50%, I believe Mr. Wahlman's figures.  This suggests we may be looking at total sales of 18,000 Model Ss and Model Xs this quarter.The stock market has been very patient forgiving of Tesla's new product production problems, but I doubt the stock market will be as patient if Tesla has a demand problem for its core products.",

"Greetings to all, and thanks for interesting views, pro and con.  My 2¢ if I may.I’ve ridden in a Model S, I was mightily impressed, it was “intoxicating”. “The car of the future”, the big question being just how far in the future.Having said that, I am extremely put off by the reckless statements made by the CEO.  Nevertheless, I feel that he has positioned Tesla well ahead of the mainstream manufactures on BEV, in part by his commitment to “electric only”, not the complexity of hybrid vehicles.  Making and selling hundreds of thousands of well-engineered vehicles is no small trick (neither was landing a rocket booster upright, but I digress.)So what to do?  Many of the longs may well have gotten in some time ago, so even with the stock off its highs, they can feel bullish.  And the financials are abominable, so the shorts have every reason to think the end is inevitable.So grinding it out myself, demand is really sort of a big question mark, but I do believe BEVs are the future.  So how does Tesla survive to get there?Obviously, a capital raise is imperative, but from whom?  To me it seems obvious, Tencent Holdings.  Having made zillions on what I might consider goofy games, they have plenty of $$$ and are spreading it around.  And I just do not believe they are going to let their 5% stake in Tesla go down the tubes.They may let Tesla go belly-up first, and buy up on the cheap, but I think they will ride to the rescue before that.  This is a long-term play (see above about the question of demand), but I think they are in for the long-term.So my bottom line: Tesla is too risky to go long or short, but I’m long Tencent.  I think Tesla will likely remain a premier EV brand for years to come.And as for as the Model 3, see the Consumer Reports test, they really liked it (and loved the Model S.)  So notwithstanding plenty of “teething pains”, the products deliver.  And I think they can sell plenty of cars at “near luxury” prices as demand increases, and maybe they can figure out how to make money on lower margin cars.  Or maybe not, they may just stay closer to that luxury market, and survive there just fine.  And while I bristled when Musk literally laughed at BMW’s EV efforts, to look at an i3 compared to a Model 3 really is sort of laughable, only one looks like it’s from the 21st century.Other than being an auto enthusiast with an ME degree, I know nothing, just speculation.  But I just do not see Tesla disappearing.",
"Really outstanding effort again, Montana and CoverDrive.  Thank you for putting it all together.As a pre-emptive strike against the eternal optimism of the bull camp when the Q1 results are reported, let me throw out for consideration the lease accounting change.  From the 10-K""The adoption of the ASUs will accelerate the revenue recognition of certain vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee, which will therefore qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return as opposed to the current accounting as operating leases or collateralized lease borrowings""I haven't read the standards change nor have I spent much time thinking about it, but all equal the change would seem to increase reported revenue for a given number of car sales.

With that said, I don't know by how much.",

At this stage of research, none of the results look pretty for the unsecured creditors.  Depositors will be well-advised to consider whether the bears might have a point.  If they conclude that we do or might, they should then reflect on their chances of getting their deposits back in a situation where everyone else is trying to get theirs back too.",

Hmmm...Inside EV reports that TESLA Model-3 became the leading seller of EV in February despite its production problems.

It is actually quite scary to me that if the company was to start making a profit ... efficiently producing the Model 3 and making money at say $40k a pop ... and then to start to look and behave like a normal business in the line of making a profit and returning this to it's owners or reinvesting it ... analysts and the punditry would then have to start assessing the company like any other business that is in the line of making a profit yadda yadda yadda ... they would be forced to line it up against it's peers on standard and similar metrics ... and the POOF ... the share price would collapse ... it wouldn't stand a chance ....,

I personally believe that the “to-be-added” semi-manual lines mentioned in the 8-K “correction” haven’t been added yet - or at least not in the scope they planned. They need the semi-manual processes to get to 5k, and the fully automated Grohmann line only adds 2-2.5k as Musk said (in my mind, if he says 2k the capacity is likely lower and 2k is what you get from the Grohmann line of you turn it up to 11).

so what is that? like 9 million dollars per day every single calendar day of the quarter. And that's after they lost what? Almost $8 million a day every calendar day LAST quarter. And about 5 Million dollars a day for every calendar day for the quarter before that .... Is this the stepped exponential of which The Chosen One speaketh?I'm contemplating what will their final week of q1 model 3 production be? I think they will definitely be above 1250 because that is half of what their target and they seem to have gotten into this habit of selling exceeding half of what they said they would as some sort of (im)moral victory. So somewhere between 1251 and 1500 is my guess for model 3 final week of q1 production. They also always pump up that last week of the quarter to make it look like they're ramping things up and then the beginning of the following quarter they go right back in the hole for their usual anemic ramp up which will probably be about 800 a week or 750 a week in April until the final couple weeks of the next quarter where they ramp up again. That's their version of stepped exponential. So I'm going to say 1325 for the final week of March.,

W/ amd'S very low production costs vs dgpu, they can offer very cheap raw gpu processing power.The popularity of the apu value platform, will drive developers to optimise their code for apu strengths.Memory speed is vital to cacheless apuS, and it's evolving fast for amd apuS.

"AMD should win and win in quality and innovation.  Intel won because people trusted its CPU quality.  Such consumers' viewpoint turns around quite slowly.  In innovation Intel still has an upper hand on burst data transferring which determines the per core speed.  Other than that Intel starts suffering, basically caused by its old CPU structure, such as Meltdown defect and the much larger die size the review has pointed.  In quality aspect AMD has chased up and even run over.  Just compare CPU heat sinks and fans you should notice the difference.   AMD's fans are like Japan made, pretty, slim and quiet, and Intel's are like made-in-China, lousy and chunk.  Holding a new Germany-made AMD CPU, you will feel it like a treasure.  You will always respect its enormous power in video editing and multi-thread applications.  What you can think Intel' new CPU after so many Core-i generations?  5% speed increase or nothing.

AMD should design and produce cheap, power-saving, simple and fast GPU in 10-nm tech, not for gamers but for popular consumers.  Right now daily PC work on 2k or 4k LCD monitors relies on much old 40nm Radeon 5450 or 6450 video cards, which you could only buy used on Ebay.  Most earlier generations of Intel Core-I CPUs do not support display mode larger than 1920x1200.",

"Exactly why I think 7nm Vega is a modular implementation. It just doesn't make sense to do a large monolithic chip on 7nm, particularly at the START of the node. It would be a very expensive gamble AMD cannot afford. If they are keeping Epyc 2 at or below 100 sq mm per solid rumor, they would logically do the same for their GPU. Perhaps the high bandwidth controller and cache on one chip and ~100 sq mm worth of compute units on another.",
Raymond thanks for the very comprehensive study of AMD. Ther is only one area you did not touch. Is AMD´s management more or less capable than Intel and Nvidia. It seems to be less as they have not being able to materialize so many technical advantages into a superior pricing power and a bigger share. Something is still wrong.,

One thing you didn't mention that I believe is another reason to be a long investor:   Lisa Su is proving to be a total bad ass as CEO.   No gimmicks, no BS, just leads with solid execution, the company just keeps doing what she says they are going to do.    It's not a coincidence that AMD's fortunes started turning around strongly since she became CEO.    Do not underestimate the value of great leadership.",

"My synopsis of AMD story.In Past AMD declined for three reasons1) AMD did not have enough money for both Fabrication and Architecture improvement2) Intel's anti competitive behavior3) Bad Management Team.Current and Future Growth Story for AMD1) More than half of 7000 engineers at AMD are working on GPU the rest are working on CPU. There are more software engineers working on the GPU side. Software is a very important aspect for enabling features in GPU. AMD will do very well with Machine Learning with Vega (7nm) and Navi(maybe with McM, removal of pixel engines). Radeon technology is now everywhere in Desktops, Mobile, Servers, Embedded. So GPU business is as important to AMD as CPU business. The C&G revenue of $3029 in 2017 increased from $1967m which is 54% growth. More than half of the Growth came from GPU side of business2) Market Share and Gross Margin Growth will be from following products in that order : EPYC, Ryzen Mobile, Embedded(Networking, Storage, gateways, vision based systems, IoT) , Ryzen Desktop, Vega( Machine Learning, Professional Graphics). Back of envelope calculation show EPYC revenue will be 1b for 2018 and with GM>=60% lets take Profit as 500m. This gives eps=50c. Add to this 40c from rest of products the eps comes to 90c. So AMD stock price should exit 2018 at around $25(taking conservative pe of 30)3) Market dynamics in 2018 will be determined by how successful ""Intel Inside"" Marketing campaign is(which pays off OEM for selling Intel machines), Shorts who still believe AMD stock price is overvalued, Short Squeeze if one of the Earnings come with revenue >2b",
you've been warned . my buy limit orders are in below 2.40 for amd and below 26.35 for Intel. lol,
stock now under 12 to get to 20 not plausible if it goes buy it on the way up say over 13 otherwise just dead money and the semi market very complicated last year ryzen was supposed to be the greatest innovation obviously not true,
"There are.... some factual issues here.One CCX, a group of 4 Zen Cores, is ~44mm^2.  The die is 213mm^2.  Just shy of Polaris 10/20 232mm^2 die.Now, they still enjoy greater margins, even excusing the similar die size compare to GPUs as the cost to produce are much lower (no need for PCB, larger box, RAM, larger/high TPD cooler, etc).  So for total costs, for a $200 product MSRP (RX 580, R5 1600) the GPU likely has in the $50-75 in VRAM costs alone.Mindfactory’s numbers are about DIY sales.  No classic OEMs involved.Also Specter is a far cry from 40% overall... while it may be there in some cases, highlighting that is disingenuous .",
well done AMD. and you will be 5 years behind again shortly. but well done for now. short everything it's coming folks. the writing is on the walls.,

Thanks Raymond.. excellent article.,
Wow.There is so much false and irrelevant information in this article it is staggering.I literally could pick 10 completely false statements within 1 minute of a skim true.It might even be libellous.An article written with a bias of extreme magnitude also.,
"I've been building PCs since 12, when my first machine was a socket 939, A64 3200+. Amd was killing it with the first optimized 64 bit arch. Then the advantaged waned with Core2Duo (I built a E8400) and AMDs faltered attempt with bulldozer. I also built a FX8320 and had it overclocked at 4.3ghz.  Amd received a lot of hate for Bulldozer/Vishera but besides pure power efficiency and synthetic benchmarks, casual users would have NEVER known the difference. My FX8320 crushed multi media 1080p encoding  and I built that machine using my existing socket AM3 motherboard from a Phenom II X4 965 build. AMD has always presented excellent value as Intel ran unchecked for close to a decade as system builders and OEMs favored Intel, despite the higher costs. I also have built 2 home theater PCs (HTPC) using AMDs APUs. The APU was PERFECT for a small efficient build for media purposes. I'm so glad Raven Ridge is the culmination of 8 generations of APUs.. Intel has NO answer for these chips.Onto graphics. I've used Nvidia and AMD and once again AMD always had value. The HD4850 was one of the best budget cards ever under $200. I ran two of these in crossfire until 2011, when I got another great budget chip the HD6950. Then comes Polaris, the Rx480, received a lot of hate for not dethroning the 1070, but that was NEVER the point. The RX480 accomplished exactly what it was supposed to. Affordable (key phrase) 1080p and moderate 1440p gaming for under 230. The Polaris chip does that, and still to this day does game great. As more titles move away from Nvidia Game work developer tools and become DirectX 12 optimized, AMD cards continue to game great. The computational prowess of the GCN architecture is why miners use it. They're cheap and efficient at mining calcs. Now, as a realist, AMD flubbed Vega. It achieved 1070/1080 performance 18 months too late.  And consumed way too much power. Unfortunately on the GPU side, AMD has to rely on VEGA until 2019. Hopefully they release a Vega with GDDR5X to at least bring some cheaper efficiency options.Long story short, as a user and builder I've always liked AMD. As a budget minded techie, they've always met my needs. Being obsessed with 4-10 frames per second or 5-10% in synergies Benchmarks should never be a reason to overpay.Long AMD. So long.",

This exceeds previous sales levels over 2011-17, according to South Korea's environment ministry. Sales for the 12 months to September are about double that of all of 2017, with the full-year 2018 target six times that of 2016 levels.The ministry said demand for EVs has accelerated since a package of policy measures was introduced in September 2017 to reduce fine-dust emissions, including more government incentives and an increasing roll-out of charging infrastructure.South Korea's government plans to add 1,866 rapid charging outlets this year, including 755 that had already been installed as of September. The 2018 target is double the number of fast charging stations that were installed in all previous years combined.The government sees the additions of more EV models further boosting demand. Seoul aims to increase the number of EVs on the road sevenfold by 2022 to 350,000. It is also accelerating the retirement of coal-fired power plants and requiring pollution control to ensure lower emissions from the energy sources that will supply these vehicles.Seoul aims to have 10,000 charging stations nationwide by 2022.

Corporate activity is negligible, indicating that prices north of $100 are not the issue of actionable concern.The takeaway is that cobalt prices will go higher, much higher. And only at much higher prices will the true nature/shape of the demand curve and cost  curve begin to emerge.The Chinese and Apple etc are looking ten and twenty years down the road, not two or three. And that begs this author to use his skills and experience to take not 'a position' but rather a serious and unbiased stab at the 'demand curve' and its dynamics quantified.",
Excellent article John.  Thank you very much !,
I think the purchase by Apple of I think over 4B of cobalt does support some of John’s observations.  One way to ensure supply and stem what has been a dramatic cost increase in cobalt prices is to use your cash to buy ahead. Apple has plenty of cash to do so. Those who don’t take similar action will have to deal with future price increases and/ or supply restrictions or replace current chemistries with those that use less cobalt and have acceptable performance characteristics. To the extent that new cobalt supplies or breakthroughs in battery chemistries are underestimated  by John the future of EV s in particular and Tesla will brighten. As of this time his assessment appears to have more merit than not. Just like peak oil technology was underestimated and we now are talking more about potential oversupply. No one knows whether some dramatic discovery is around the corner.,

There is a huge potential supply that is just starting to roll.  I suggest you all look at GaribaldiResources.com Be sure to read the PR that cites up to 8.4% nickeland .18% cobalt.

Interesting times to observe.,
"Thank you very much for this interesting perspective. The liability risk to auto manufacturers from even a small number of  811  fires  would be very significant, hence the major developments of new mining projects (several likely to come on 2020-2022)and pre-buying of near term cobalt producers outputs. This will also lead  logically to new chemistries being introduced and refinements that add extra energy density or other desirable characteristics (eg safety) to 811 or similar.  I am wondering if you have looked into the leading contenders for alternative chemistry (including modifications increasing safety, reducing cobalt, increasing range to existing chemistry AND new options both solid state and eg graphene based, prieto etc ? There is likely to be a significant near term cost reduction in few layer graphene , which is already occurring in many-layer graphene and use of  boron compounds opens a few options. I certainly think your analysis is salient and should not be dismissed because its uncomfortable. We should also not doubt the ingenuity and resources that are being rapidly thrown at this problem as EV makers each develop their own strategy to pass through the 'Cobalt bottleneck'  (Its not a cliff its a bottleneck 2020-2023) by pre-buying mine output etc . The Tesla issue is just that this bottleneck arrives at the very point they are bottlenecked by multiple other issues and competition is arriving. I wish Tesla well but it will take one hell of an Houdini trick to get through this extra constraint, although they have the right person for the job in Elon Musk. The opportunities for thoughtful investors here are large. There may also be a demand substitution for stationery uses with flow batteries  for example.  Looking forward to your thoughts and an article on this topic.",

Now as cobalt price is high and there is a clear deficit or wait a couple of years for the potential cobalt cliff as you say. Next year there will be a massive new cobalt supply available so most probably price will drop but who knows. Something i m missing in your article is the impact of copper as cobalt is a by product so if copper price fell so will be cobalt,

"Hey John - thanks for the analysis - UBS analysis is a little dated now and most of the projections I see now from various analysts have moderated the NMC811 production and its negligable by 2025. More importantly in the analysis of cobalt market balance its essential to look at cobalt chemical separately from cobalt metals.  Cobalt chemicals are in deficit depending on the rate of adoption of EV but not cobalt metals. Cobalt metal producer could choose to make chemicals. Furthermore, lets not discount how fast Chinese will be able to bring on the next nickel laterite projects (HPAL projects) which will add significant nickel and cobalt.  The bigger issue I see is what are we going to do with LIB recycling side - the cliff we should be contemplating is also environmental. Would love to see you do a piece on the recycling side of LiB",

"NRA_Platinum_Member>>One major issue for nickel is Yucca Mountain nucleqr waste project, it will use massive amount of nickel, potentially drive up cost.Could that help to drive down the cost of cobalt, as cobalt is most often produced as a secondary product of nickel and copper mining?",
John R. Scully at Univ of Virginia and Joe Payer at U of Akron are experts related to corrosion study for Yucca Mountain waste prpject by DOE,
"Nickel content contributes to capacity while cobalt contributes to rate capability (how fast you can discharge) while managanese stabilize the material, Mn has to be less than 50% in ordee to avoid formation of spinel structure LMO which tends to leach out Mn cation and causes quick capacity fading, Nickel cation has a tendency to switch structural location with Li when you synthesize the compound, that causes capacity fading as well, thus NCA uses LiNi0.85Co0.1Al0.05O2 formula, but NCA is the most volatile cathode material, thus violent fire when Tesla Model S catched fire. It is difficult to eliminate Cobalt, as Nickel has limitation. One major issue for nickel is Yucca Mountain nucleqr waste project, it will use massive amount of nickel, potentially drive up cost.",

"I think it is a CVS/Walgreens compare from the customers perspective.  Convenience, staff you happen to like at one particular store but probably not a whole lot of substantial difference... Both seem to be really good operators actually.  The mega hub concept is a good idea on AZO part.--Failure is their biggest category and usually an immediate need, so having it in-stock or available later that day is of huge value to a lot of customers, and definitely to their commercial customers who are less price sensitive.   I am also intrigued with their (AZO) potential in Brazil.  They talked about it a little on the call.  Sounds like they are close to a model they can scale in Brazil.  They talk about it being a much larger market than Mexico, which is around ten percent of stores (currently 532) and brought in 188m in operating profit in 2017.  On a constant currency basis the Mexico stores seem as profitable as US.    A lot has been made of AZO's debt.  I'm less concerned than some.  I don't think they have more than 500m that is due in any one year over the next several years.  So it would seem if they can't refinance at an attractive rate, they can use cash flow to retire it.  They also have a lot of owned real estate on the books that has been on the books for a long time and is probably undervalued if I were to guess.My guess is they do credibly going forward, at a below market multiple today.  I think they will die slower than most think.. I could be wrong",
"Nice article, very well supported thesis. AZO has challenges for sure but it's a well run company in terms of allocating capital. I traded it long profitably near the lows and missed the run above $700 but thought it might be a bit frothy so I was okay with missing out on some upside. I will go long again if it continues to sell off because I think a goodly chunk of their business is relatively sticky from online competition. I work on my own vehicles and buying parts from ebay or Amazon sellers is something of a crap shoot as the difference between a quality part and a cheap knockoff can be large. There is also an incentive for online 3rd party sellers to lie about brand with counterfeits. Shipping can be slow and returns are a hassle. Sometimes you are in the middle of a job and need a part or tool right now. The thing about AZO and ORLY is that while they aren't cheap for parts you can get many parts quickly, trade in your old part without shipping it (imagine shipping your old car battery or alternator for a trade in), have a quality assurance that comes with traditional b&m retail supplier vetting, and get info or advice from the salespeople. Then there is the mechanic shop business which I think is pretty sticky: if you are a shop do you want to put in a $75 alternator of unknown quality bought on Amazon or a $125 one that you are assured of quality? Since you pass the cost on you probably want the expensive one so your repair doesn't break down and your reputation suffer as a result. So yes auto parts are one area of b&m retail that I like. Also BBBY I own as they are good capital allocators too and have a considerably stickier b&m line of goods in my view. I for one would not buy a bed online without having sat on it. I admit I once bought a recliner online but I ended up regretting it.",AutoZone's Best Days Are Behind It
There are a lot of unfounded assumptions in my view. I stopped reading after the section about “men” only watching house of cards on Netflix...In my view Marco Polo is a much better show... House of Cards got very stale quick. But there are so many better shows that aren’t mentioned. Netflix by far gets the most bang for their buck in the content category.,
excellent article.,
100 million subscribers are all idiots and paying for shows they never watch. Hmmm??!,
"In pay TV, rating is linear to revenue. In streaming, subscriber number and ARPU are linear to revenue. So while Nielson matters in TV world, Netflix is absolutely correct at pointing to their subscriber numbers instead. They can produce only garbage that nobody is watching, as long as they have some magic to keep subscribers paying I couldn't care less.",
"70% of network shows never get renewed. I am pretty sure Netflix does much better than that. Netflix have hits and misses. But they can get a better hit rate than all competitions due to their superior tech advantage. They can estimate the size of audience more accurately than anyone in the world. They can also reach niche audience better than anyone in the world. With all these advantage they can produce niche content for niche audience, something nobody else is capable of doing right now.",
"OK, I'll throw in my 2 bits worth on Netflix content.  I did like Altered Carbon.  Also, still a few Marvel Universe shows left to run out on contract until Disney yanks them back such as Jessica Jones (new season about to come out) and Luke Cage.",
"Apparently, the author doesn't think that males watch quite a lot of that content, along with females watching a lot. I don't have enough time to catch everything that the wife and I would love to watch. Mindhunter is great and Manhunt is on My List. RomComs are good too, such as Love Per Square Foot as an example. Netflix finished out Longmire among other kudos. I've been impressed with many of the originals, such as Marseille (S2 is on My List). Yes, Netflix has hits and misses; but the simple fact is that everybody is not going to watch everything. Disney may have a ""timeless"" catalog; but, the wife and I have not watched Disney content in a long time. I don't see us as subscribing to Disney and don't have an Amazon account either.",
"I agree with the overall point that it's better to have more than one source of revenue to cover the costs of obtaining revenue, and that Netflix is in real danger of being overtaken and supplanted by the likes of DIS.  But in Netflix's defense on the content point, you forgot to mention Orange is the New Black, which is extremely popular, particularly with the female demographic.  I also watched Sens8 and thought it was excellent binge television.  You also ignore Stranger Things, which I've not watched but basically everyone I know has, and which seems to have captured the cultural zeitgeist.  I also hear people talking about 13 Reasons Why and Narcos (a lot of people push me to watch that).  My wife and kids watch Fuller House on repeat.  Over and over and over.  The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is hilarious.  I'm not trying to be an apologist; I know they've had a bunch of misses as well.  But to act like NFLX is basically House of Cards, the Crown, and a bunch of nothing, is off-base.  Whether they can continue spending to support their original programming habit is a valid question in light of the competition, but I think they deserve more credit for work produced thus far than you are giving them.And as far as my demographic goes, I am married, with kids, and a household income of... we'll just call it ""a lot"".",
"You are correct.  I'm male, I've watched House of Cards, and I liked it.  Other than that, there are only a couple of other shows on Netflix that I have watched or do watch currently.  I don't watch movies on Netflix, because they don't have any good movies (thousands of crappy ones, though).Once I've caught up with Black Mirror, I'm going to cancel my subscription for half a year or a year, until they have more content on the small number of shows I've been watching.",

"""Patent InfringementIn July 2016, BlackBerry Limited (“BlackBerry”) filed a complaint for patent infringement against the Company in the Northern District of Texas, alleging infringement of multiple patents with respect to a variety of technologies including user interface design, encoding/decoding and call routing. In September 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss these claims and in October 2016, the Company also filed a motion to transfer this matter to the Northern District of California. In January 2017, the Company filed a notice of Suggestion of Pendency of Bankruptcy, which initially stayed the proceedings. The stay was partially lifted to allow the court in Texas to rule on the two pending motions. The Company’s motion to transfer the case from Texas to California has been denied. The Company’s motion to dismiss BlackBerry’s indirect infringement and willfulness claims was granted, although BlackBerry was provided an opportunity to file an Amended Complaint to cure the deficiencies, which it did on October 19, 2017. BlackBerry filed a proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Court. On February 20, 2018, the Company and BlackBerry entered into a settlement agreement resolving this dispute, and the Company shortly expects the Court in the Northern District of Texas to enter an order dismissing the lawsuit, with prejudice. A loss reserve has been established for this matter. The Company considers this matter closed, except for distribution of the pre-petition allowed claim in accordance with the general unsecured claims procedure pursuant to the Company's Plan of Reorganization.""Worked out to $40 million - final settlement to resolve ALL pre and post petition claims.

"I’m struggling to see why you all don’t expect the “settlement” to come in the form of a discounted acquisition price. A $1B settlement, paying only the current market value, would imply a $1.3B cash payment for Avaya. This makes the most sense in my eyes.",
"I would be very surprised if the settlement amount is less than 100 mil, and Avaya is forced to stop ripping off BB IP. Avaya has been stealing BB ip since 1991.",
"Remember if Avaya doesn't pay up or stop stealing BB IP , BB can have their products banned! That would effectively put an end to Avaya. So BB is holding all the cards.

/what is the net debt of glencore?,
"Thanks for tickling my confirmation bias Mr. Hecht.I agree and GLEN is my NO.3 holding. It is quite diversified by geography, product, depth of value chain. Since it focuses on mid and late cycle commodities there are likely some more good things to come before this cycle keels over, especially from Cobalt, Copper, Zinc, Met. coal. Mining is widely seen as so old economy but the more electrical vehicles take of, the more GLEN would benefit. They have spare capacity e.g. in Zinc that they mothballed when they thought prices excessively low and they claim to have a fair amount of brownfield expansion options that could be brought to market more quickly and cheaply than Greenfield projects. The trading arm is a stabilizer, broadens the spectrum (a lot of oil trade, little equity oil for instance), is a door opener. Some people say a public co is at a disadvantage to private outfits re. discreet deals, but that remains to be seen.Since Mr. Glasenberg (CEO) and staff hold about 30% of the equity there may be an entrepreneurial edge / better alignment between shareholders and their agents running the shop.GLEN greatly improved their balance sheet (10.7 B vs. adj. EBITDA 14.7 B) although their def. of net debt is optimistic (but not uncommon in the commodity field): They deduct from interest bearing fin. obligations not only cash / short-term securities but also the value of their ready for sale commodities (which caused a few panic moments during their mini-debt crisis in 2016). As almost always in the Resource field they operate in some not quite kosher jurisdictions (think Congo, Kazakhstan..) but you need to be in Congo if you want Cobalt.... . It is a challenge - what do you do if the local honcho demands $, plumbs... on the side for himself, his cronies, his campaign...? (At least for now they are mostly in Katanga - a pretty stable part of Congo - near Zambia)They do mine & sell over 100m tons of coal p.a. - so if you are touchy about climate change maybe not your favorite pick...A '?' is the macro outlook. Yes all bright for now, but raising interest rates and $ would be a headwind for commodities and China with 40 - 50% of global consumption in most metals is the elephant in the room (have they indeed got a handle on their leverage? Will they continue to shut down polluting mines?) - trouble is  not the baseline scenario but a risk factor to watch for..Thanks for the good inputs re. commodities anywayRegardsNIcklaas",

As an example, when they talked about their applications plugging and playing with Amazon Echo and such, I really didn't ""get"" what they are up, but can only have ""blind belief"" they are doing something that will leverage their sales capabilities, across the world, as these IoT platforms seem to be proliferating everywhere.

"The whistleblower who exposed Bernie Madoff thinks the insurance industry is riddled with fraud.The Big Four accounting firms are so bad at catching fraud that they couldn't even catch a cold, with incentives in the industry totally screwed up. That's the view of the of the whistleblower who uncovered the $65 billion Madoff Ponzi scheme and he thinks fraud is endemic in the insurance industry as well.Harry Markopolos is the former derivatives professional turned independent financial forensic investigator who spent nine years trying to convince the SEC that Madoff needed to be examined, but it was only the onset of the financial crisis and the massive redemptions he faced that forced Madoff to turn himself in.Since then he has been a vocal critic of the SEC, writing the 2010 book 'No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller'. In a special interview with Real Vision TV, Markopolos now has the institutionalized shortcomings of the audit world in his sights and identified the insurance industry as the next big sector for major financial fraud to come to light.In fact, he intends to blow the lid on some major insurance frauds in 2017, which he hopes will lead to stronger regulation in the sector.Madoff Showed How Easy it is to Fool the Big Four AuditorsThe fact that Madoff feeder funds were getting clean audit opinions from the Big Four accountants, when Bernie was stealing every dime from day one, shows how easy it was for Madoff to fool the accountants, Markopolos said, adding that in the history of accounting it's impossible to name even one multibillion fraud that the Big Four uncovered.""Now, if I asked you, to name all the big, multibillion-dollar accounting frauds that the Big Four aided and abetted, we could be here all afternoon,"" he said.""The incentives are totally screwed up in the accounting industry. There is no way the company should be paying the audit fees. It should be the shareholders. It should be a fee. Every time you buy a share, a certain number of basis points should be allocated to audit fees. Because the audit fees are currently way too low. Management brags about how low they've gotten the audit fees.""So audit has become a commodity. The people doing the audit, 80% to 90% of the contact hours are by someone in their 20s. Well, who is going to catch fraudsters when you're in your 20s? The only way you're going to catch fraudsters is to have thinning hair, gray hair, or no hair. You have to have been around the block and then burned several times before you're able to catch fraudsters.""Accounting Industry Crying Out for ChangeMarkopolos goes on to say that shareholders should pay a fee every time they buy a share or purchase a bond, which should go directly to fund the audit. Plus, you need auditors with a range of experience in sectors like banking and insurance or manufacturing so they have the ability to spot fraud. ""Whatever that industry is, they know every trick in the book. They've studied every fraud in that industry, and they can detect it readily,"" he said.He'd like to see less focus on the young 20-somethings, doing the bulk of the work and better training in terms of uncovering fraud, rather than navigating around the subject. ""They don't do a lot of substantive testing, because that's expensive. So what they do instead is they do analytical tests. They just run some numbers through algorithms that they have, and they say, well, that's our test. And then they do very little substantive testing.""For instance, most of the accounting firms, they'll take 75 sample transactions, and that's what they'll audit. And it might be something very stupid the way they do it. It could be the 25 largest transactions of the company for that year, it could be the 25 newest, and 25 something else. Well, many companies will have millions or tens of millions of transactions, and you're auditing 75 and you're saying that statistically relevant? I say bullshit. That's not relevant at all.""Unregulated Insurance Sector a Recipe for Systemic DisasterAs far as Markopolos is concerned, the insurance sector is a very close cousin to Ponzi schemes by companies that are run poorly,""The insurance industry is unregulated everywhere. In the United States, we have 50 state insurance commissions. I think 43 of them are politically appointed by the governor. Seven of those commissioners run for office,"" he said. ""And it's a race to the bottom in regulation. If you have the easiest insurance regulations, you'll take in the most insurance fees, because operating carriers will choose to domicile in your state and put their employees in your state. And you'll take fees in to your state Treasury.""With only 7c from every dollar of insurance fees going towards regulation to fund the Insurance Commission, the whole industry is a profit making machine for the states, which just want to get the most insurance companies domiciled in order to get the most insurance jobs.""The gatekeepers are supposed to be the Big Four accountants,"" Markopolos said. ""But we just went into how they're not the gatekeepers. The state insurance commission staff, their investigators are even more poorly trained than the Big Four if that's possible. And so they rely on the Big Four on the financial statements that are put together along with the statutory financial statements that are filed in each state, and they basically run through some mathematical formulas and run some ratio tests and say, well, this company seems solvent.""Then you have another gatekeeper that's also proven ineffective, and that would be the rating agencies. So if you can't get a job on Wall Street, and if you've graduated with a business degree, and no one else will hire you, who's the hiring authority of last resort? It's the rating agencies. It's for the kids that can't get jobs anywhere else.""And so the gatekeepers are bad. And then you have the state insurance commissioners that are worse. And they're the low bid for talent. They pay the least. And so they catch no frauds.""SIVS and SPIVs in the Caribbean - A Repeat of 2007 in InsuranceThe systemic risk builds because all the insurance companies are putting their reinsurance offshore in the Caribbean and Markopolos contends that you're not going to get the reinsurance market properly regulated there. Furthermore, with cross-risk exposures between insurance companies unknown, it's just like the swaps market and you don't know where the reinsurance really is.""In 2007 heading into the global financial crisis, we saw how that worked out, with all those hidden liabilities that were sitting in the Caribbean in these special investment vehicles, in these special purpose vehicles and the SIVS in the SPIVs,"" he said. ""They ended up coming back onto the bank's balance sheet and sinking them, resulting in a rescue.""And in the insurance industry, we saw AIG needed a rescue. We saw Hartford struggle, Lincoln Financial. If it hadn't been for the rescue programs run by the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve, we would have had numerous insurance companies go under. Well, the situation is only worse. Basically the insurance industry is where the banking industry was in 2007.""Insurance Fraud Exposed in 2017How this all comes out in the wash and who is left holding the baby when the music stops, remains to be seen. In addition to the negative interest rate environment, Markopolos said the insurance industry faces many risks that can't be managed, such as an Ebola breakout or major earthquakes. ""You find out that your reinsurers had too much earthquake risk that they were reinsuring. But you weren't measuring that before, because you didn't know to measure it. There is no measurement of cross-risk exposures. And so the whole system collapses. It's a daisy chain, sort of like AIG. If you don't rescue AIG, it's a daisy chain of risk, collapse after collapse, and before you know it, your financial system is blown up,"" he said.So it's almost a lottery in terms of what issue comes along to start the chain reaction, but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a natural disaster or a pandemic, with the industry ripe for fraud and financial scandal.""I have some large insurance fraud cases that I'm going to make public in 2017,"" Markopolos said. ""And they're going to be in the tens of billions of dollars each. And I'm hoping that will be the catalyst for reform, hopefully for some congressional hearings and that we see national regulation of insurance and we see them become Basel compliant. Because there's lot of assets and liabilities there-- there's trillions in assets and liabilities there that are unregulated by anyone. And we don't know what the cross-risk exposures are. And so it's a recipe for a systemic disaster.""",

MHLD quarters are increasingly getting worse-yet, all the while,they say in their CC's that the next quarter will show improvement because they have better auditing, learne from their mistakes, blah, blah, blah.Although, with the exception of one large position last year that I/we lost about 20% on, wehave done well overall in the past 8-9 years.That being said, I'm staying away until from MHLD until they get clear of AMTRUST and they get their act together, which obviously they haven't as yet.No position in MHLD; exited two months ago.Good luck to MHLD Longs.",
"Without Amtrust resolution, this thing wallows.  How much longer can they keep the dividends if the Amtrust underwritting book continues down this path?",

I hope you're right.....  BTW, I was wondering - if MHLD, theoretically, were to run a tender for either their baby bonds or preferreds that are now trading at a substantial discount, and then retired them, would they then be able to take a profit on the amount of the discount?   Wouldn't that make more sense than continuing to allot 75 mil to share buybacks?",
"Nov 13, Director bought for 300000USD at 6.40.",
Don't you find it suspicious that this company started reporting losses from the moment Amtrust was under investigation for accounting fraud and continues to do so today?

The same crooked owners are involved.  The buyout of Amtrust is a ruse.  This one will continue to tank.,

Suspend the dividend.  GE is at a critical crossroads, all of the skeletons have not been found, and they cannot afford $4 billion for dividends.  If this company is committed to righting itself, the dividend has to be put aside.c.  An accounting of the assets GE has unloaded and the impact those sales had on its balance sheet.  I feel very strongly that some crazy accounting went on with the spin-off of Genworth and Synchrony and I believe a full accounting should be provided to understand what residual liabilities may have been retained as part of those deals, and any others that occurred.d.

Considering the market is not receptive to new financings atm APH and NUU are acting prudently by conserving cash.""we think Aphria just robbed Nuuvera shareholders with a $32 million reduction in offer price.""Not entirely cuz NUU shareholders are getting shares of APH so if APH ends up with more cash on hand post merge the NUU shareholders are getting some of that $ 32 million back trough their ownership on the combined company. Anyways who is robbing who here with a very generous offer of $8.50 made to NUU.  40 cents on $8.50 is less than 5 % anyways, the price of these stocks ie their value varies by that much daily.Of course getting 40 cents less sucks but it's in the best interest of the new merged company in wich the NUU shareholders will participate.",

"I was kinda bearish on this one before the most recent earnings report if you can believe that; it was after i read the K closely. Looking at business segment growth, in my mind it's not as bad as it looks. I actually started to become a little optimistic due to that & the low price.That said, I was not aware of the allegations that they are not in the business they claim to be. That puts an interesting spin on things for me and certainly makes me more cautious. Especially and also because as the OP mentioned- they didn't give many specifics on guidance.I am really unsure on this one but might (or might not,) take an extremely small plunge at these very depressed prices. Would probably wait for it to drop a bit more either way.",

That’s over the three yes not each year. Their wells are mostly better than DVNs or Continentals . Didn’t say they are only ones there. Just believe over next three years NFX will perform better operationally. Stock may or may not respond. They do not try to pump up stock with BS. In second half of this year will be covering all cap x with. cash flow. If oil drops to $50 then they will still be in free cash flow . Oil is a crap shoot for sure. Not for everyone.

Do does Continental or Devon among others.  Also, NFX is heavily hedged into next year.. we shall see how the performance goes by the end of the year.  I do think there is some value in this stock,  but too much instability/lack of visibility for me to put much more $$ into O&G at the moment.

I like their operating results in Oklahoma. Stock has sucked like all energy stocks. In their conference call stated they would have over a billion dollars free cash flow  next three years if oil over $60 . The wells they are drilling are some of the highest producers in Oklahoma and getting better each qtr. they will probably have another beat the first qtr when they report in may .,
"What makes you say they are of the best operators in OK? Define ‘best’.. i give you that their stock did very well during the downturn and especially relative to others, but it seems to have lagged as oil prices recovered since 2017.. maybe function of their hedging strategy?

NFX deserves a much higher price. Selling at 10 times past earnings and 8 times future earnings.

"I'm not sure folks understand that share is percentage of total sales... total sales can grow for both companies AMD can still gain share.For example... if NVDA sold 1000 GPUs last quarter and AMD sold 1 and in the next quarter the numbers were 2000 to 10 then AMD would have increased share.Now, we may also have to consider whether the stats are assigned to a particular market or use (allowing for disparate growth outside that category as well).",
"Maybe this is a dumb question, but how could AMD gain so much market share if both companies are selling every GPU they make?  It's not like there are Nvidia GPUs sitting on the shelves because people are choosing AMD over it.  Does a gain in market share mean that AMD is now producing more GPUs relative to Nvidia than in the past?  And could that be explained by the rumors that Nvidia has cut production to prepare for the release of Ampere and/or Turing?  Does this information about market share changes raise the probability that Nvidia will announce new GPUs at GTC and will start selling them shortly after, possibly in April or May?",
"Anecdotally from my wide reading, there is now a big market segment consisting of fence sitters who know they HAVE to modernise, but cannot bring themselves to buy their ideal system in the current market.This steers folks to cheap systems which can be easily and non disruptively upgraded later.AMD hold a straight flush in that game.Starting with a $75+ AM4 mobo and a $99 or $170 APU as a place holder, users have a thoroughly modern platform that can be upgraded in minutes by swapping in stronger AMD Zen and Vega processors later when market turmoil is over. The operating environments are identical so the process is a no brainer even for newbs.The above is easy. Replacing a mobo however is not, and risky on a mission critical PC even to an expert. Intel are famous for introducing mandatory new motherboard platforms for even incrementally changed new model CPUs.These fence sitters may have strong intel/nvidia loyalties, but an amd platform is the only viable route for this category, and an amd platform makes folks lean toward the synergies of an AMD discrete GPU as well when the time comes for the GPU upgrade.i.e. these fence sitters are committing to buy more from AMD in future quarters, and have been lured into becoming new members of the amd userbase.Installed userbase size, is of course the first consideration for software developers in devoting resources to optimise for different processors. APUs will own the biggest volume PC segment, and they bring many new ways for developers to cost effectively tweak their code to their product's advantage.The advantage of having the dominant userbase numbers, and therefor a better optimised software ecosystem, has long favoured intel/nvidia. APUs stand to reverse that.",
"To be more accurate & oddly omitted afaik, the gpu card supply constraint is not gpu chips, its ram, especially the slow to ramp, new HBM gpu ram used  by Vega. Hell, AMD is ~""giving"" vega  gpu chips away free in their new $99 APUs (the 4 core APU is the equal of competing cpuS, and the apu includes decent graphics) - the same core vega GPU chips as used in $1000+ vega dgpuS.This clearly shows that AMD have no problem supplying processors ex ram (APUs use no scarce gpu ram (yet)).Dunno how it relates to this article, but from now on in this weird gpu market, AMD APUs are really the only option for entry level gaming using a current generation gpu.To simply match a 2400g APU, would cost $100+ more, and there is no point in going to the hassle of dgpu to simply match an elegantly simple APU and its inherent ADVANTAGES. The real choice is whether to substantively improve on an APU, and that's ~$250 more than an apu, and having invested that extra, it becomes a false economy not to spend more again on CPU,  power supply, ...Bang for your buck in  PC budgets has been eroded in other ways also. NAND memory for SSDs and system memory DRAM are both currently scarce and dear. VAT keeps creeping up remorselessly in many global markets.Its AMD or nothing for many on a budget, and no point spending more for others.APUs offer inarguable value at their price point, and well beyond and below (they are a big step up for console buyers for not much more).AMD APUs will simply own entry level PCs and eradicate the entry level (now ~$120) graphics card market.An vega apu may not be a lucrative sale, but it counts as an amd  vega sale. AMDs raw unit sales will look rosy if they execute APUs as well as Ryzen, and the omens are for  even better ramping than Ryzen - there are plenty of tried and proven moboS this time, and the Zen processor's teething & all important credibility issues are behind them.",

Great article!  One point tho - I've seen this is multiple artlcles >> Miners cannot find GPUs and we're NOT the reason for the shortages in that segment.

"Whilst much of the analysis is fine and some of it is overly optimistic in Tesla's favor there is one major error. Tesla is NOT $2 bn over budget on the Model 3 line! I am sure that they are well over budget but much of this years projected capital investment is for the second production line and not to finish the first line. The second line will be amortised over 1 million vehicles as well so it is NOT fair to charge an extra $2000 of depreciation charges to every vehicle. When Tesla said that capex would only be around $2.5 bn it was for the first production line which would allow them to produce 250,000 vehicles per year and NOT the full target of 10,000 vehicles per week. In my view the second line will not be built. The annual demand for Model 3 vehicles is unlikely to exceed 250,000 vehicles per year and certainly not if they try to push buyers to paying around $48,000 plus per vehicle. Musk has said he will wait until the first line is producing the target of 5,000 vehicles per week before going ahead with the second line. If this decision is not made until the end of June there is no prospect of the second line being up and running this year. In my view he already knows he is not going to go ahead with the second line and will invest the funds on the Model Y instead! He should tell the market now but he won't!",

"I stopped taking Enron Musk seriously after his boring company started forming. I had more respect for him after he gave up the hyperloop idea to focus on SpaceX and Tesla. How does he think he can compete with essentially the entire world of car manufacturers whose sole focus is on making the best cars to maximize profit. At some point this will all come crashing down and fast. Anyone remember 3D systems? It was once a high flyer with huge debt from acquisitions pushed by the motley fool crew. I think its peak was $80 or $90/share after several splits. It now is about $10. To their credit though, they were at least showing profits for awhile. Musk has ADD and while I guess that is good for multi-tasking, at some point he has to be reigned in.  I've done work in the Volvo semi factories and its not a trivial task. He is an utter moron for implying they will be ready in 2019 or 2020. If he said 2025, I MIGHT believe him.

Unfortunately Tesla reports expenses differently than most other car manufacturers so Gross Margin and Opex ratio comparisons are more useful.

Since they have faster growing infrastructure costs than their competitors, they will have a very difficult time generating a profit and definitely not in 2019 as all the analysts project.

We can think of a huge number of ways to make it far better, far more efficient.Jeffrey B. Straubel - Tesla, Inc.Yes, maybe just to add to that. I mean, the products' bill of materials cost and the embedded labor cost is, I think that's where there's opportunities. And we are simplifying and we're finding ways to improve the design incrementally as we go through the ramp. If there's some small increases in CapEx that doesn't directly – it will be overwhelmed by the improvements and simplicity and some cost savings in the product itself.______Elon Reeve Musk - Tesla, Inc.And we've tackled that on multiple levels, so we have a design that is nearing completion for a new automated system for Zone 1 and 2 that is being led by our Tesla Grohmann team. It's an excellent design. All the other work that they've done has performed to spec, and we expect a single Tesla Grohmann line to be equivalent to three, if not four, of the current lines that we have and be smaller, which is kind of amazing.Guess what? The German engineers have -redesigned the battery pack assembly line and have made significant improvements that far exceed the guidelines of 2016..prior to Tesla buying the German company..Whatever suppliers have cost increases or raw material costs have risen, I'm certain that Tesla has gained more productivity in the design of the Model 3 that offset these costs additions.I think they are quite capable of getting 25% margins in 2018 on the Model 3.",
"Excellent article. The $2B extra capex remark is eye opening, adding $2000 to the cost of each car assuming 1 million cars produced. Except thru borrowed the money, so interest and opportunity cost, and the laughable notion that they will ever build 1 million Model 3's.

"LOL -- 25% gross margin on the Model 3?  That will never happen.  TSLA has already shot itself in the foot by floating the $35k myth about the Model 3.  If TSLA makes any gross profit on the Model 3 it will be b/c the price of the vehicle has been booted to $60k or higher.I don't believe anyone, even the Kool-Aid drinkers, will  a 2swallow a 25% gross margin on a $50k Model 3.  That is just another myth.Musk is changing his behavior lately because any scrutiny of his promises of the past has shown him to be completely incompetent or simply a con man that thinks he can say anything and it will be believed.TSLA is up against it financially.  There is an unavoidable need to get a huge cash infusion just to finish putting the Model 3 on the street.  And, blowing hard on his road show has shown Musk to be unable to deliver on his promises.The recent 10K is stark in showing, in a crystal clear fashion, that TSLA is manipulating wording to present an adequate showing to the SEC and the public investing community.  A two-year old can read b/w the lines and see that TSLA is barely holding on.  One hiccup away from dissolving.  Even the Cult followers can't delude themselves into thinking that TSLA is on firm ground financially.  And, a $350. share price proves that this POS can fall a long way down.  Great opportunity for the short sellers.",
Good article.  Hard to rebut the facts presented.  I would also add that before the model 3 “launch” in July 2017 (ie beta test rollout) Musk was claiming that the M3 factory would be better than or equal to the best auto manufacturing facility in the world.  This now laughable claim presumably factored into any Tesla 25% gross margin estimate.,

"Good article, I shall take a closer look at APA. I got out long ago because they seemed to be constantly seeking and not finding a new direction to go. Now it seems they have. I like what they are doing in natgas and the infrastructure build. I have AR and EQT partly because they have good infrastructure as well as good reserves.

RDS bought BG with it's Brazilian deepwater assets  - compared to that move APA should be much more attractive.",
"Enjoyed the article!I added some APA below $34 last week. Implicit in that is the belief in Alpine High and that it can deliver huge amounts of NGLs to the Gulf Coast substantially below $2 mcf. My guess is the market will come to appreciate APA but not for another 6 months.The excess spending to bring Alpine High online will go away when APA sells the midstream assets eliminating debt. For now even though they have received good offers it makes sense to wait and sell a turnkey system with heavy flows moving through it. I think it will sell at a profit with a long term limit on pricing for the NGLs moving through it.So far APA is bringing the gas liquids online to get the whole project profitable. Then they can bring the 500+ Oil drilling sites online. In my view for now Oil is out of favor, gas is really out of favor and APA is flat out undesirable at least until the financials prove the company correct.APA near 5 year lows has been a good buy!",

"FT,I have not really looked at Apache in too much detail before, but am pleased to say your article has inspired me. Now, I took a quick peek at my trading platform and saw that Apache is now also available on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Although I cannot see any mention of that on the Apache website. This would certainly appear to offer the opportunity for me to trade the stock in my home currency. I am also wondering if it might relieve me of the requirement to pay US withholding tax. Any thoughts / comments on this?On another subject, the current decrease in the oil price from recent highs seems to me to be driven by 2 main factors, they are inter-related and both originate in the US. Firstly US oil inventories have started to bottom out prematurely and there is obviously a fear that they could start to increase again. This could just be due to seasonal variations in consumption and import / export balances. However, the second point is that this change in inventories looks more and more like it could also be due to increases in US shale production. I am really outside of the picture on this one, but I am getting the impression that the ""Fracklog"" of ""Ducs"" may now be decreasing as operators choose to complete and produce at higher prices - also, I would guess that some of the promised midstream infrastructure expansion (pipeline capacity) could now be in place. The recent shortage of frac sand availability also leads me to wonder if resources are being stretched. If this is indeed the case, then perhaps any further increases in oil prices could be quite a bit further on down the road. Again, all comments welcome.",

This gas processing plant is in the Permian area and will start consuming a significant portion of Natural gas production from the Permian basin. The Kinder Morgan new pipeline with 42"" pipe running from WAHA to Corpus Christi comes on line in Oct 2019. I do not feel tight market for moving gas is impact on Apache.

"FT,I agree that technically APA is now very cheap at $34. Unfortunately it also seemed rather cheap to me at $44 and $42 and $38, and so I already have a full allocation of its shares - thus no ST profits for me even if it jumps back. In the end, it does not really matter what we think - what matters is the price that the market has allocated it. Like many, I imagine, I was slaughtered in February on many of my oil, gas and gold shares. I sold off a number of 'other' shares during the month to take profits, as I want more cash (thus sacrificing the greater perceived LT gain for a ST gain, I imagine, but c'est la vie) - the problem is now that, in addition to holding unrealised losses, as the shares sold were all non oil, gas and PMs my allocation to these unpredictable commodity sectors is now increasing to high levels. So, while there are seemingly bargains aplenty in these sectors (anyone for ESV at below $4.5, APA at $34, AEM at $37 etc etc??), I am unfortunately out of the buyers market for some time - it would be great to have zero exposure and to be able to enter now, but that is not the case.Soooo, while - as far as I know - no-one has a crystal ball, my question is whether you see the price fall in oil, gas and gold shares continuing into the summer, or you think things will at least level off?

"Like the structure of the presentation and like following the company and the Alpine High (as a story).  Some comments:1.  I just watched the CSIS Tight Oil conference presentations (skimmed through some, but got most of it).  Rusty Braziel had a very negative projection for gas transport out of the Permian.  Thinks Waha might even go negative total price this year (because there is too much gas and the crude wants to get out).  If so, APA with a gas play is going to have problems.  Could really throw a monkey wrench into things if they have already planned and prioritized Alpine High (contracted the work, etc.) or if they need to get the leases held.  They mentioned trying for a little more oil but this may be tricky if the leases require depth to hold the above formations.2.  The above may be why stock is low right now.  Doesn't mean it will go down more (or up).  Just means market has priced in a possible problem.  (But if the problem occurs, the stock would drop more.  And the converse.)3.  Thanks for note about grandioseness.  I will try looking at transcript and maybe listen to call again.  Not sure I noticed it before, but appreciate the heads up.  I like the people who are honest and direct with the questions, not dancing around (if you can't or won't answer, say so, but don't play politician game).4.  Tracking boe growth is not helpful because the barrel of gas is worth a quarter of a barrel of oil.  Especially an issue for APA which is developing a gas play.5.  Don't like the technical analysis.

unfortunately in today's instant gratification Society stocks that have a long-term strategic Vision like Apache are tossed out like yesterday's garbage onto  the refuse pile. After all where is the giant stock buyback that so many other management friendly companies are doing in today's market?  Who cares that most of these companies are buying back their stock at all time high prices which any student in finance 201 would tell you it is a terrible return on investment and capital.  or who cares if buying back millions of a company's shares will increase leverage for companies that already have too much debt?  Or who cares about what happens 3 years from now with a long-term play like Alpine High when other energy companies are sucking out every last drop of their reserves today to show high production numbers to shareholders.  The Jim Cramer's of the world love the Diamondback Energies and the EOG Resources who pump like crazy today and throw cash at their shareholders at the expense of their future.  Sadly in this market Apache is just to  most investors as out of date as a punch card computer.  that is why today's Equity Market is so scary.  Solid companies with long term strategic Vision like Hess and Apache get their stock price destroyed rather than rewarded.  Long-term is no longer sexy,

As I understand your article, is it your opinion that given the auditors language in the 10K as you referenced in your article (and pursuant to the FASB going concern standard) is it PWC's opinion, as the outside auditor, that Tesla should not have any problem either extending or rolling over, i.e. refinancing, short term debt over the next year? Is this based on an assumption that no rating agency will downgrade Tesla's debt in 2018? If so, if there is a credit downgrade, does it change the PWC opinion? Please note debt due in 2018. In other words, is this opinion only as enduring as and dependent upon the present credit ratings???? Is PWC's opinion based upon the 5,000 car per week original requirement Moody's set to maintain the present credit rating?

For the gross margin, does it make a difference that the examples you've chosen are mostly big established companies and Rigel's a first-timer after decades of being in clinical stage?  Can you provide a source for the data you use?3. The equation you use to work out the sp at which one can expect a positive EV is extremely interesting.  It provides an estimation of the sp one may speculate more rationally, provided 3 variables are estimated accurately enough of course (the probability of + or - outcome, and the two possible target sp in the event of an approval or rejection).  Is this your own formula?  Do you think that this kind of formula (or something like it) is also used by the institutional owners to guide their buy/sell decision?Thanks again for this great article.",

"Stock splits are usually bullish short term for the stock price. Will the split supposed to happen before or after the new Dutch Auction? I didn't read any firm dates except April 24 annual meeting to vote on the split.Is it in HLF's best interest to goose the price up before the Dutch Auction and pay more money for their own stock? Sounds counter-intuitive but so is the announcement of the Dutch auction without any details, and the name change.Making announcements to goose their stock price up, and borrowing money to buy their own stock at a much higher price seems so silly, but I read what Old Analyst said about a reverse takeover.  How many Dutch Auctions would it take for Ichan to get to 100% ownership? What would he do then with the company? How much would it owe by then for all those stock buy-backs?Why would management allow a 1/4 owner of the company to rule it like a dictator anyways?Maybe they have their own agenda for higher stock price (like stock options they can convert to cash).It sounds great to have a 1/4 ownership in something and have it's valuation climb up, but what if you can't cash out like us peons? I don't know how much control he actually has over the company but since he can't sell in the open market without bursting the balloon, he sort if IS the company. That is, look at the balance sheet to see what it's worth, not the market price.Or maybe Ichan has other tricks up his sleeve to exit at or near the market price. I don't know.

Icahns name splattered all over the news this weekend negativeky re his recent MTW sale. This certainly adds another wrinkle and potentially a stepped up timetable to sell. I can see the ‘Get Icahn ‘ trade getting legs if this MTW story has traction,
"Our median employee’s annual total compensation for 2017 was $34,379. As a result, we estimate that Mr. Goudis’ 2017 annual total compensation was approximately 193 times that of our median employee.",
"In previous years, the Committee set the average sales leader retention performance target for SARs awarded to NEOs at 50% as an aspirational performance hurdle in light of the Company’s annual sales leader retention rates over fiscal years 2004 to 2011, during which the Company’s median annual sales leader retention rate was approximately 44% and a rate in excess of 45% was achieved only twice. Annual sales leader retention rates in excess of 50% were achieved for fiscal years 2011 to 2016. In order to drive continual improvement, the Committee determined to increase the difficulty to achieve the performance criteria of SARs for 2017 by increasing the threshold and maximum target percentage levels as set forth below.",
"The 2017 SARs are subject to potential, partial early vesting as follows. If the Company’s sales leader retention rate for fiscal 2017 equals or exceeds 52%, then 20% of the 2017 SARs will vest in February 2018. If the Company’s sales leader retention rate for fiscal 2018 equals or exceeds 52%, then an additional 20% of the 2017 SARs will vest in February 2019.",
Performance SARs are less dilutive to our shareholders than many forms of equity compensation. Performance SARs provide an opportunity for executives to earn additional compensation if the following criteria are achieved: (i) the Company’s sales leader retention target is achieved and (ii) our share price increases over the share price on the grant date.,
"For 2018, after reviewing the Company’s historical results, the Committee determined to adjust the performance target achievement range to 95% [from 100%] and 108% to better align with market practices.",

"Volume Points are point values assigned to each of our products for use by the Company to determine an independent member’s sales achievement level. We assign a Volume Point value to a product when it is first introduced into a market and that value is unaffected by subsequent exchange rate and price changes. The specific number of Volume Points assigned to a product, generally consistent across all markets, is based on a Volume Point to suggested retail price ratio for similar products in the market. Volume Points, which are unaffected by exchange rates or price changes, are used by management as a proxy for sales trends because in general, excluding the impact of price change...excluding the impact of price change...excluding the impact of price change...Management is evaluating our current approach to assigning and maintaining Volume Point value for certain products or markets in order to better align qualification thresholds across markets. Any changes to this approach may have an impact on the use of Volume Points as a proxy for sales trends in future periods",
"In 2018, in furtherance of its commitment to improve the alignment of our executive compensation program with the interests of shareholders, the Committee determined to eliminate performance SARs from the design of our long-term incentive program. Beginning in 2018, grants to NEOs pursuant to our long-term incentive program will consist of PSUs (75%) and time-vesting restricted share units, or RSUs (25%).",

"I will restrict my comments on HOW these MLM companies work.    I know at least 10 COUPLES, friends of mine, who got suckered into these Schemes.   As ""distributors"" you are SOLD a ""BILL of GOODS"" called ""the initial Complement of Goods"" or ""Required Distributor's Initial Inventory"" - - they use flowery Phrases in the Marketing Contract language.  The consumers are the distributor MOM or DAD or FAMILY UNIT.HOW DO I know?Well, I assisted in writing this language for an Unnamed VERY LARGE MLM company.   There are common terms used in these contracts, varying from company to company.""THE UP-LINES"" are the GUYS ABOVE YOU, or GALS, WHO PUT the order in on ""your behalf"" and then the promises end there.   It slowly dawns on Distributors that NO ONE ELSE wants these products, so they have a shelf in their dark garages or basements full of creams, salves, cans of Protein Powders, Vitamins, minerals and so on.It is up to the ""DOWN-LINES"" - - otherwise KNOWN as the ""suckers"" in their Corporate Boardrooms, to BUY that inventory and maintain a minimum, in some cases. I do NOT know the insides of the HLF Distributor contract language, but in effect, the ""DISTRIBUTORS"" are the CONSUMERS until they realize, the hard way, that they have been screwed by their UPLINES.Management throws a  big party every so often.  THE TOP PERFORMERS in their respective regions, will throw a big party, a RAH-RAH, where POTENTIAL SUCKERS are invited and they all get very excited to join up in said MLM company.ON AND ON.   I know this business.    I understand the intent.   I am suggesting that the profits are REAL, that the only truth in these matters is they INDEED MUST CONTINUE to move into new sucker regions, such as China, India, etc.My wife and I are in Portugal right now and Inn Keepers, a family of young professional Portuguese, were HLF buyers and they are GIVING away their products in their Inn up in Ericeira.   THEY GOT SUCKERED into thousands of dollars of inventory.   THEY CAN FIND NO ONE who can afford these retail prices.HLF is a profitable business because they have OILED their business to be very penetrated.",

Good luck with your Hail Mary ... I guess after so many Years of Losing on Herbalife ... You can blame the USA System ... There are now Pro Business heads of Both the FTC and SEC ...

"NOW that Icahn has publicly humiliated Ackman, what point is there for Icahn to hang around.....He will be out in weeks.... and HLF will halve.Mr Bill Ackman,Your actions resemble a capitalist parasite, the conduct where one questions if there is a moral cell in the perpetrator's body. You have more than a billion $’s to your name, where you publicly claimed you would go to the end of the earth to prevent the scourge of HLF's pyramid scheme. But your short existence there, was purely for profit, hoping to exploit others who exploit the poor. Herbalife.Does that make your conduct a parasitic leech one level up the food chain? You could have exited Pershing’s position (outside investors who didnt claim your virtues) but maintained your personal stance, in accordance with your public vow in Nov '13. But no, you ran, despite your public vows and affluence.I really hope you get your just desert in this lifetime.In case you forgot,Ackman claimed this in Nov '15Reuters: 'Ackman Vows to Take Bet Against Herbalife ‘to the End of the Earth’The activist investor William A. Ackman said on Friday that he intended to take his high-stakes bet against Herbalife, the nutritional supplements company, “to the end of the earth.”http://nyti.ms/2jEoQ8rPls confirm Bill or his PA (poor lass working for a someone who demonstrates the backbone of a parasitic leech) gets this, will you.Someone has to tell B Ackman there is a God and a purpose to his life.Back to subject:Compliance Monitor's report soon to be made public, via a demand from SEC to FTC:A number of people submitted FOIA requests for the report but it is pending release.IMO this is why HLF is DESPERATE to make moves towards being a private company.It wont deflect FTC scrutiny, but it will SEC.There are currently requests to the SEC to OBLIGE FTC to make the compliance monitor's findings public.This shouldnt take long; Icahn has won, humiliated Ackman in one of the most sensationalist corporate duels in the last 3 decades, and Icahn has no more skin in the game.

He might've learned a lesson or two about his ego, along with the ramifications of going public about his short position, where unfortunately someone bigger and more powerful than him, who's always had a personal vendetta against him, basically crushed him like a small ant. It is just imo that Ichan will bail soon. I just can't see how anyone who is not emotionally invested in this stock that the fundamentals have, and will continue to deteriorate. China has a huge population, but then where will they go to continue this ponzi scheme? It is all there and clear as day for me and a lot of others to see in black and white. Ackman and all the shorts will eventually be proven right, now whether you lost or made money? That's another story.Be well",
"Sad outcome... Ackman deserved to win, but it was always a fraught proposition with the level of ego involved... What remains is still a wreck and a pyramid scheme. Never mind that the legal system is so defective and the SEC and several AGs completely dropped the ball on this scam. The fact is, as an economic construct MLM is a disguised pyramid scheme, regardless if it is illegal in any given jurisdiction, and regardless if the criminal justice system fails to prosecute it. The economic reality remains. Perhaps a few people have learned to stay away. This fight will repeat, until we have some Elliot Ness show up who carries on the fight to the bitter end.",

QTR.  haven't you been a bear for years on this stock.,
It is beyond coincidental that this news and the Ackman news come out on the same day.  It seems likely that Ackman had already closed (or was closing) his position and HLF got wind of this and pounded in the final nail with this latest news.  It was a lot to put into a single press release and completely engineered to move the stock up.Too bad they are not as forthcoming on their level of compliance with the FTC order.  I can assume they were not compliant otherwise we would already have heard about it.  As long as the FTC remain silent on this question they become complicit in the deception.,

And, as you said yourself, if he sells the stock craters and he'll never get out of his balance. It is much more likely he is continuing to do what he has done in the past, which is what I called a reverse takeover. I've described it in the past. In a ""normal"" takeover the acquirer takes on debt to buy the stock, supported by the cash flow of the underlying company. Here it's reversed as Icahn's ownership percentage goes up every time the company increases its debt to buy stock. Highly unlikely Icahn will sell into the deal, IMO. In the meantime, I'm thinking about selling into it myself. MAYBE. Years ago I was asked on the HLF board about my thoughts on valuation. I replied I had none as I thought valuation was irrelevant to the then-current stock price. Now, I'm THINKING about it, for the first time since I first bought the stock more than 5 years ago. I never dreamed, at the time, that HLF would turn out to be a Long Term investment for me.

From the Financial Times tear sheets: at the moment Nestle's p/e ratio is 37X.  div. yield 3.1%  ROA is 4.5% and ROE is 10%. debt to cap is 29.6%.  5 year dividend growth rate:  2.77%.

ROE 36%.  debt/cap 53%.  5 year dividend growth rate, 5.3%.Long Unilever PLC, on which there is no withholding on the dividend.  Nestle being Swiss, there is a withholding tax; be sure to own it in a taxable account so you can take a tax credit.While it is not exactly comparable to Nestle or Unilever, consider US supermarket champion Kroger, at a p/e of only 12X. Kroger is the largest grocer in the US, with sales almost double the sales of the next largest competitor. Kroger has nearly 2800 supermarkets, most include pharmacies and on site gas stations.Kroger's private brands, with some 40% manufactured in-house, provide 26% of sales compared to an industry average of 18%.

"A few points.1) According to the paper, the ""primary endpoint variable was change in Symptom Score (IPSS) at 12 months and at LF"".1a) Does ""LF"" mean long-term follow-up?1b) Is there any direct evidence (i.e.: commitments from European regulators) that they will weigh LF and other ""co-primary"" endpoints and secondary endpoints more than the 1-year endpoint? There is a 2012 protocol mentioned, but I couldn't find it.2) The finasteride study..2a) The baseline on the finasteride study was different (10 vs 23 on this study). The patients on this study were much sicker, ostensibly, so finasteride may have done better in this study.2b) But besides that, the IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) was developed in 1992 -- same date as the study. But, they did not use the modern IPSS scale, so you can't compare the studies directly:Finasteride 1992 article scale: www.nejm.org/...Current I-PSS: www.urospec.com/...The finasteride 1992 article scale was 36-point scale where 9 symptoms were scored from 0 to 4. The current scale is a 35-point scale where 7 symptoms are scored from 0 to 5, along with a separate quality of life (0-6) question.1992 scale vs IPSS today:1) urinary hesitancy || does not exist now2) terminal dribbling || does not exist now3) impairment of the size and force of the urinary stream || exists now (5 -- ""weak stream"")4) interruption of urination || exists now (3 -- ""intermittency"")5) incomplete emptying || exists now (1 -- ""incomplete emptying"")6) urgency || exists now (4 -- ""urgency"")7) dysuria || does not exist now8) clothes wetting || does not exist now9) straining or pushing to start urinary flow || exists now (6 -- ""straining"")Frequency nocturia are not in the 1992 study's scale.3) I do not understand how they conducted the studies.They had four studies: 17, 18, 20, and 22.17 and 18 were double-blind and randomized, 3:2 drug:placebo, 500 patients each, one-year duration. What happens next is completely unclear.3a) The abstract states: ""12 months post-treatment patients elected no further treatment, approved oral medications, FT, or interventional treatment.""The paper states:""Crossover studies: 351 patients after completion of 0017/0018 (maintaining initial treatment double blind) were randomized (n = 344 treated) at intervals of 0.5–39.1 months after the first year (mean 20.4 (SD 7.15) months post-randomization) into 2 open-label FT re-injection 6 month studies NX02-0020 and NX02-0022 (0020/0022) with additional LF""So ~650 patients did not participate in the crossover studies. It is unclear to me what treatment they took, which is important to understand the long-term study results of Table 1. Similarly, we don't know what happened to the other ~350 patients after the open label.Based on those numbers, about 68% of patients took the drug at least once in either trial and 32% didn't take it at all in any trial.In Table 1, you have ""patients with prostate cancer"", which is 349 on FT vs. 95 on placebo. That's a follow-up of 51% vs. 24%. And there is data missing. After 17/18/20/22 trials, patients who took placebo only might have taken the drug, or those who took the drug may not have taken more drug. So, the cancer stats in Table 1 are a bit problematic, as far as I can tell.",
"Another consideration here on European filing coming first:I believe many randomized controlled clinical trials in Europe use the standard of care as the control arm, not placebo.  Under this scenario, Fexapotide would do well versus any of the alpha blockers on efficacy, side effects and safety.  There are plenty of data sets for those alpha blockers out there to compare v Fexapotide P3 results.This may be one reason why European filing came first.",
Article doesn't say how BPH compares against Rezume,
"Stan, thanks for the tremendous effort in your write-up.  The peer reviewed study including Neal Shore, Ron Tutrone, et al represents a group of serious key opinion leaders. From these people that were in the weeds conducting the trials and those lucky enough to have received the treatment (like James Robinson who bought his way onto the board and cannot buy enough of the stock--including what little the company is willing to sell him to stay liquid) there is ZERO doubt this drug is not only highly efficacious for BPH, but increasingly indisputable that it dramatically staves off the risk of prostrate cancer.   The only question investors should have is whether or not there were any (company inexperience related) procedural slip ups in properly assembling, recording and submitting the data to ensure timely European approvals. Would be a travesty for any further delays, but we are living with the potential consequences Averback's unwillingness to let go of any control.",

Is that INSURED losses or TOTAL losses?  a $400 billion insured loss would be close to a TRILLION dollars (probably in the $700 billion to $900 billion range) economic loss.  We would have other things to think about.  As would WB.,
WB can get a good price when the market dives as a result  of Trump's stupid tariffs on steel and Al. If these  tariffs take place a major recession could hit by 2020 and Uncle Warren can scoop up the bargains.,
"Actually , insurers have more or less stopped going out of business after catastrophes. The increased reliance on commonly accepted catastrophe models made it possible to tap outside capital , including insurance - linked securities. That's a benefit of greater accuracy or the cause of chronic underpricing. A $400bn event would be a thrilling but not terrifying rollercoaster. Whatever the covered losses turn out to be , the world can expect significantly higher premiums.Any cataclysmic event is not likely to overwhelm available capacity from the insurance sector.

So I'll be content driving my 19 year old 3.2 liter 5 speed manual.I think an overlooked reason for the decline in diesel acceptance has been the rise in fuel cost, as noted by a previous comment.  Diesel used to be less expensive than regular gas, since it was less refined, but came to be as expensive as premium gas, if not more.  It gets to the point where the fuel economy doesn't outweigh the extra fuel cost, not to mention the upfront premium on the vehicle cost.",

"Hydrocarbons are extraordinarily efficient -- orders of magnitude better than chemical batteries.  Electric motors are simpler than ICEs, but we choose to use ICEs because of the overwhelming advantages of hydrocarbons.The issue is pollution and greenhouse gases.

We need to separate the fuel from the motor.If we today had a way to produce greenhouse-neutral hydrocarbons at a competitive cost, there would be very little discussion of BEVs.  They would have their place in niche applications, but little else.The fact is that it is possible to do exactly that -- make greenhouse-neutral hydrocarbons.  There are several good ways, in fact.  One is through algae farms.The issue is cost, but if people haven't notices BEVs are not cost competitive either, and that is after tens of billions being invested in R&D.

"That's hilarious.  Swiss Re was a pioneer in the ILS market....the firm held top ""sell-side"" league table positions for years by securitizing its own risks and those of other issuers.   Now the CEO insults the intelligence of investors in a market that his firm helped to build.  I'm not disagreeing that these investors may be mispricing insurance related risks (many risks are mispriced now...not just in ILS). It is just amusing to see a CEO try to dismantle a market that one of his subsidiary companies spent almost 20 years trying to build.",
"I have not looked recently at Munich Re. From memory:1. They have this property / casualty insurer Thalanx - for better or worse. Maybe worse if you look at their growth and margins.2. They are a Re-insurance powerhouse (together with BRK and Swiss RE). They do have worldwide capacity (so can balance risks well), underwriting cachet and deep knowledge3. If you read Buffets letters this and last year (and other opinions) it looks like a lot of overcapacity in the market (and for lack of barriers to entry no end to it), On the other hand that shows in the valuations already, so If you get the turning point right - you clean up nicely. After a lot of damages like in 2017 prices often firm...but this time?4. Re Insurers are afraid of not having access to enough risk pools. Concentration in insurance reduces RE demand. Alt. risk transfer does. At the same time every other MBA thinks he understands underwriting better read more supply - softer rates. So they are looking for alternatives, like closed book life insurance, more health - life RE, competing with their customers...Is that in the (low) valuation or is there more to the downside?5. Somehow the non-Buffet insurers did not manage float   like he did in BRK. If you don't you miss a big return component. Can you compensate thru better underwriting? It is easier for Re insurers as they may not have the same pressure by their salesforce as property / casualty insurers do. So maybe the combination price /  book value < 1, moderately growing business, improving prices can do the trick and the market is late to realize it. But I am not sold at the momentregardsNicklaas",
"I like that argument Mr. Evans.I also believe it is a diversion and borderline farcical coming from Swiss RE.Swiss Re has told us for years that the hedgies and Bermudans are not up to scratch re. risk analysis. Fine - then they should be gone by now. But they are not. So either they are not as dumb as Swiss Re seems to think or dumb capital is indeed flooding your industry and then you need to sit on your capital, fire your sales reps and underwrite only stuff where you clean up a multiple of your actuarial risk but nobody dares to tread. Buffet style, if you want to believe this gentleman's lore - which maybe you should for instance when he opined in the recent shareholder letter that there are no barriers to entry into insurance - apart from regulation = market closure.But there is very little regulation in RE-INurance and market access is a lot easier than for primary insurers all over the 3rd world - where the growth is. So get used to it: There will be time and again dumb capital entering your turf. Maybe they get weeded out by mis-pricing or not even understanding risk cumulation, legislative / judicial trends or just inflation. But maybe in a ZIRP or near ZIRP environment you just have so much excess capital entering your risk pool that you have soft prices for a decade - like you have in container shipping after everybody knew exactly what type and how many ships to build for a few years and found fools to bankroll him. Overcapacity as far as you can see....Its getting even better.Swiss RE has just recapitalized its direct line business after burning thru 90% of the capital (in that line) over 2 years. A decade or so ago they told us they needed to pull out of direct property & casualty insurance so as not to impede on their customers. Now they went back and burnt their fingers. Question: Did they have the models right and just got hit - or was their modeling of the tail risks bad - non existent and they played with big boys that knew a lot more about the risk than Swiss RE did.  There was an ugly moment in the 3rd quarter earrings discussion where some of the analysts sniffed around that question - but no pit-bull analyst around, everyone keen on further access.You see as a re-insurerer you have all the data and underwriting skill of the primary insurer in question and of others that you reinsure  working for you and you may have additional knowledge....but if you underwrite the big boys directly it may be they who are in the know.So in this context it is quite funny to complain about the alternative capital not knowing what it is doing...but maybe I am the only one to think so.Maybe not. Why could you buy a stable or moderately growing business that made around 10% ROE and yielded 5-6% plus sometimes special dividends at below book value for years? Somebody did not quite trust them...maybe with reason.Maybe the Softbank alignment can open doors in China, maybe their deep knowledge  is about to shine again  - I just lost the trust in their underwriting and sold out for now.kind regards Nicklaas",Swiss Re CEO Questions 'Decoupling' Of Risk Knowledge From Capital

This decrease has adversely affected our results of operations, in particular our volume-related revenue, and reduced our effective price per gallon (discussed under “Results of Operations” below). In addition, we recognized no revenue from sales of LCFS Credits during the third and fourth quarters of 2017 because CARB had restricted our ability to sell and transfer LCFS Credits pending completion of an administrative review. We were, however, required to settle preexisting contractual obligations to transfer LCFS Credits to third parties by making cash payments totaling $7.0 million, the equivalent value of the LCFS Credits we would have otherwise transferred to satisfy our obligations. These payments are reported in Asset impairments and other charges in our consolidated statements of operations. In November 2017, CARB invalidated certain LCFS Credits we had generated in prior periods and released the restriction on our ability to sell and transfer LCFS Credits.

Here's my concern.  The company certainly has KPI's that provide ROI on stations.  Why did management wait so long to close those stations?  For me it reflected a very late reactionary move rather than an early one.  Some of those stations were specifically mentioned by Littlefair as having no future since the locations required engines that did not yet make it to market. Then why build the station if reliable engines aren't to market and why wait so long to acknowledge and close.

"This company has no idea of how to act on behalf of shareholders.  It's BOD needs to be trimmed and replaced in its entirety.  It's a bunch with many past political connections that has delivered destruction of shareholder value.  All their connections did not result in the rapid growth of NG as forecasted over a decade ago.  There is too many senior executives being paid way too much for what they deliver.  I researched NG Advantage recently, and since CLNE bought them, they continue to add management staff and are busy promoting people constantly.  No wonder the company doesn't talk about them anymore.  The compressor business was losing money so it makes sense that A.L. Would continue as it's Chairman.  I was hoping he would leave CLNE and go to the compressor company full time, but no such luck.  They need to pay for results.  I have never seen a management team have so many out of the money option grants (because the stock continually drops) and KEEP THEIR JOBS.

Forget Lending Tree,  the real news is the Stealth Network, hundreds and hundreds of fake posts in a HUGE pump and dump scheme, and Seeking Alpha is (I hope) an unwitting accomplice.I've read many articles where an author pops up and does a full-court-press on a single equity, and some of the commenters claim it's pump-and-dump.  I am no longer skeptical.This is the wild-west folks, and it doesn't look like anyone is paying attention.Cape Horn Investing has even been accused of this, even though a scan of my postings will clearly show that there is no such trend.

LC seems to be finding their footing.I've been a note lender on LC since the very early days and have seen consistent returns of around 6%.  I'm also long on the LC stock, at a basis of about $4.50 per share.  But it's been a bumpy ride, for sure.

"After a major scandal like 2 years ago, the most important thing this company needed to do to restore credibility with the street was to manage expectations--under-pr... and over-deliver. They have consistently NOT done this over the past 8 quarters. That price action was both short and long term investors throwing in the towel on the name.I've been in the name since shortly before the scandal broke and used that action to average down. My view--20% growth is NOT enough for a company with first mover advantage attacking a total addressable market measured in $trillions whose business model is to disrupt and disintermediate the banking industry and scale quickly with marginal costs of nearly $0.Instead, we have learned that their credit scoring algorithms were largely dependent on FICO scores, even though they told us they were able to scrape the web for borrowers transactions would result in improved credit pricing better than a conventional loan app. The last 8 quarters have demonstrated that is BS!I am extremely disappointed with company performance in one of history's most favorable credit environments. However, I have not sold a share because the stock is absurdly cheap. Unless they get better at UPOD, I will be scaling out as the deep value guys bid it up toward $8-10.

"B, would love to hear your examples of investments available to retail investors that are secured by assets and earning 7 to 15%  (net of charge-offs, etc) since that’s what you’re using in your lending club example.",
"I was an investor on the platform. I only dipped my toe in and put like 300 dollars in various notes. What blew my mind was that some of the worst performing notes I have had, came from people with good credit scores, long employment times, and decent debt to income ratios and credit utilization. Literally mid 700's credit score people living in inexpensive states never paying a dime in interest or principle. That being said I only had 2 loans that are close to default. But those 2 loans destroyed my returns from being in the 13% range to nearly 0. I have some loans still outstanding but 2 have been paid off which also hurt returns. My biggest gripe with this is that consumer lending is unsecured so there is little recourse to reclaim that money since it isn't tied to anything. When you have other crowdfunding platforms that DO offer secured loans at similar rates why would anyone choose to invest with LC. The risk is far too high. I'd rather invest in something that is secured by an asset and earns 7-15% than invest in something that is unsecured and earns the same.",

That alone explains share price behavior without resorting to conspiracy theories.As for the generally negative press coverage LC has gotten for the last few years, some of it is deserved. VCs drove the company to go public too early it's clear now, and the resulting fallout has clouded the potential for improving people's financial lives that fintech represents. What I get suspicious about is the sheer level of shade being thrown LC's way. Many of the articles read more like propaganda than journalism.

Storage seems to be emerging as a big story in the utility industry and I just realized CS referenced SunRun as a ""Solar and Storage"" company in their recent report.  Storage makes net metering irrelevant and, according to SunRun, adds additional revenue sources.  The other game changer is refinancing PowerCo post flip.  To give you some context, pools of leveraged  loans have a history of 60-90bps in annual credit losses and are financed at a 90%+ advance rate with a cost of debt ~L+160.   Sunrun has incurred less than 1% cumulative, not annual, and finances at 60-70% advance rate at L+350ish.       This will compress, both on the advance rate and cost of debt.     Because of a lack of default history, Solar will finance wide of loans, but I can easily some relief on the cost of capital.I am long SunRun.",

"Re the concerns AGO is not reserving properly, take a look at http://bit.ly/2GYmyvl You can see the ratings agencies do think their reserving is fine.  Also, you can seethe Moody's reports if you create a free account if you want moredetail.But my point is all of these agencies have looked closely at Puerto Rico exposures and have determined AGO is well-reserved.  While they could also be wrong, this does increase the probability reserving is fine.",
"LT3001:I suppose my point is that a ""concern"" that AGO is not reserving accurately or pricing its new policies accurately is not a matter that one just puts in the maybe-maybe-not box and then goes ahead and invests anyway.  A concern of that kind has to be based upon something more than an ""inkling"" or a ""sneaking suspicion"".  It has to have some foundation in fact, otherwise it would kill the investment as far as I was concerned.  Having an ""inkling"" or a ""sneaking suspicion"" that AGO is not reserving accurately or pricing its new policies accurately and then proceeding to invest would be like someone waking up one morning having an ""inkling"" or a ""sneaking suspicion"" that they might have Stage 3 cancer and then proceeding with their daily routine.You wouldn't do that.  Instead, In either case, you would subject your ""inkling"" or ""sneaking suspicion"" to examination until you were able to satisfy yourself that the answer was the best that you were going to get in order to be able to make an informed decision.",
"LT3001: ""... At the end of the day, all that matters with this stock is whether reserving is accurate & they are pricing new business accurately..."".  If you conclude that AGO is doing neither of those two things, then I don't see how you could invest in this name at all.",
"Thanks for the article Tim,While I generally agree with you and am long AGO, the only issue/risk I see with the approach you take to your analysis is that all of the bull markets you make rest on one fundamental assumption: that AGO's historical loss reserving will prove accurate in future years. As this is long-tailed insurance industry, we won't know for sure for a long time, but if they haven't, most of your bullish arguments will fall apart:*The great track record with pretty charts of rising adjusted BVPS etc assume they have reserved accurately. If they haven't, past profits & book value growth will be considerably overstated. The fact of the matter is at the moment that they've guaranteed US$8.5bn gross worth of payments to PR who are currently refusing to pay a cent. They've banked & booked the premiums on these guarantees in past earnings, but if PR can't pay, they will have to write off all those past profits and then some.*Buybacks are only accretive if they've reserved accurately. When you buy back shares, you also increase the remaining liabilities per share as well. We won't know if these buybacks are value accretive or destructive until we know how much they will have to pay out on existing guarantees in the future (PR and others).*You celebrate PVP of new business as well as the value AGO is adding by acquiring new blocks of business, but the value being added here is actually equally unclear. It is possible they could be acquiring new business at negative NPVs for all we know - it all depends how reality pans out vs. their assumptions. Of course, any insurance business looks likely to be profitable based on management expectations at the time it is written, but reality often doesn't play out like that, so simply assuming management assumptions are right and we can automatically add this new business to 'adjusted book value' is a weak argument imo.At the end of the day, all that matters with this stock is whether reserving is accurate & they are pricing new business accurately - not just for PR but for other insured credits as well. It's hard to know - maybe impossible. I agree with you that on the balance of probabilities this is a buy, but I can't get comfortable with a large position/any conviction, because:*While an acceptable PR resolution is possible if not likely, there are also disaster scenarios where PR refuses to pay anything and AGO fails in enforcing its rights, in which case it is out of pocket US$8.5bn over the next several decades. If that is the case, all AGO's claimed BV growth in the past & accretive buybacks prove illusory, and management's assessment of risk/reward will also have been revealed to have been materially off the mark, making it questionable how much risk they have taken on other policies that could become troubled over time.*Even if PR works out ok, with Trump's tax cuts, the US government's fiscal position is going to go from bad to worse, with record deficits. There is going to be a mountainous fiscal debt to deal with for future governments, at the same time that local/muni govts are facing spiraling healthcare costs, pensions, and other demographic issues. At the same time, I see a serious risk of a swing to the hard left (economically) coming in future years also given rising inequality. If that happens, pensions will not be cut to pay off hedge funds no matter what the law currently seems to guarantee. There is a very tangible risk that AGO & the other bond insurers are seriously mispricing their muni bond insurance at the moment, relying on past experience, when the future could be very different. PR is a warning shot in this regard. If this is the case, the PVP of new business AGO is writing is probably NPV negative - maybe seriously so (as has been the case with PR). This is particularly because it is hard to see how bond insurance really adds a whole lot of value. It's just a financial contract - the buyer of the insurance and the seller both think they are getting a good deal. Probable, in most cases, it is priced with an expected return of about zero.  That seems to be the case looking at the long term experience of the industry, which has never really made money through the cycle.Thanks for all your work. Like I say, I sort of agree with you. But I see the risks/uncertainties as significantly larger than you and I don't rely so much on management's claimed book values & especially 'adjusted' BV & PVP etc. I'd rather see them go into run-off, frankly.

Thanks Tim - your articles are always a good read.  I still haven't pulled the trigger on AGO even though I believe you are correct - will probably do it soon.,
"TimA couple of comments1.  You calculated that if AGO buys back another $500MM in stock in 2018, we need to subtract $500MM from its book value.  That is correct.  But you forgot to add back roughly $300MMish in expected 2018 earnings to book value, which increases the overall value.2.  If AGO has approximately $1.4 BN currently set aside for PR losses, and it currently expenses its annual $400MMish in insured PR payouts rather than draw down on its loan loss reserves, isn’t AGO setting itself up for a future ga8n/reversal if it should successfully receive a judicial victory in which its ultimate haircut comes in at “just” 30-40%?As for Einhorn’s interest in AGO, he clearly will not let us know.  If, however, he is looking to short AGO, his premise has to be far more dire than anything you have concluded, perhaps believing that rating agencies will severely slash AGO ratings to “A” from “AA”, which would eliminate the budding growth story.If that scenario does not pan out, I am not sure I see a bear case for AGo at these levels, especially if the “shorts” are effectively selling 12-ish% of their shares to the company for retirement.",
"""On the negative side of things, lower tax rates may reduce investor demand for tax free income.""Possibly true, though the top marginal tax rate for individuals is only being reduced by 2.6%. However, lower demand for tax free income = lower prices on muni bonds, aka higher yields & higher borrowing costs. Arguably a positive for monolines.",
"I'm long AGO and have added some in recent months based on valuation, but my #1 concern is as the author stated near the end of this article - that PR will get off easy via the courts which will embolden other municipalities to try the same tactics as PR.  Let's face it, bond insurers are not sympathetic figures in the public mind, so one cannot expect any political pressure to protect their claims.  I'm generally not willing to risk a lot of capital when my investment thesis depends on the court system respecting precedent, so I can't imagine AGO will ever be more than a 5% position for me.",
Thanks for the article Tim. Can you explain the difference between  operating book value and adjusted book value ? Why it is that different for AGO? Also what is the future of bond insurance looks like ?thanks again.,
Nice article.  It makes no sense for this stock to be trading where it is going to into a rising rate environment.  Higher interest rates will generate better returns on AGO's investment portfolio and will create stronger demand for bond insurance.,
"""Most problems that the company faces are known and quantifiable."" - Most problems known TODAY...others will arise.I agree the downside is very little if any at these levels. But bond insurance is a forgotten industry that will likely never be prominent or useful in a meaningful way again. So AGO is essentially in run-off mode. If PR gets worked out favorably (big if) then this should trade closer to book. As time goes on it should also trade closer to book. But they have long tail exposure. You need to be quite patient with this one. But I wouldn't be looking for a home run here. The buybacks help a lot for sure, and they should continue to have plenty of capacity to buyback more stock.

"Burt—my issue with Alteryx is the “stickiness” factor. I’d lump them in with the business intelligence group, and it seems like it would not be that painful for an enterprise to switch to a better mousetrap if one arose. It does not seem like Alteryx is the type of software that becomes embedded enterprise-wide and deals with a daily, critical function (for lack of a better example, I’ll use Salesforce as the epitome of “sticky” software that would cause widespread disruption to rip out). How would you rate the stickiness of Alteryx, and how worried would you be about another firm coming out with a better mousetrap?",
"Alteryx has no real competition.  This is why it is growing so quickly on both the land and expand sides of the business.  No other company offers a full, end-to-end analytics platform, where users (both code-free and code-friendly) can (1) discover and identify the right data sets, (2) then prep & blend the data, (3) then analyze and model, (4) then deploy and manage the analytics.  Workflows only need to be created once, then they can be repeated over and over again as the data is updated, with virtually no additional work.  This saves massive amounts of time, manhours and money.  Customers have claimed that they see a financial benefit of 100x the cost of the Alteryx software.  It is a major competitive advantage for companies to have this platform.Further, because the analytics platform is a visual, drag-and-drop model, users can easily *see* the analytical processes their data are going through.  This is a big deal.Finally, it is worth noting that the world's largest tech companies are now Alteryx customers.  In the 4th quarter alone, Facebook, Netflix, and PayPal all became customers.",

As such, the market size here is not just large, but Alteryx can reasonably be expected to accelerate penetration.",

"Great article.  Looked at on an EV/Gross Profit basis, AYX is actually extremely cheap relative to other, usually much slower growing, software companies that often have gross margins in the 60% range.  AYX has a relatively tiny amount of services (consulting) revenue because the software is easy to learn (""over a ham sandwich"" as the CEO says).The ""expand"" part of the business is indeed viral.  Fortune 1000 companies can go from 2 starter seats to 20 to 100 to 200 in a very short timeframe.  The incremental cost to sell these seats is de minimis.  Almost nobody appreciates this powerful dynamic.If AYX were acquired by MSFT, ORCL, SAS, SAP, CRM, ADBE, GOOG, etc., the buyer would essentially be buying gross profit, as much of the sales & marketing expense would be duplicative.As such, AYX is presently only trading at about 6x 2020 gross profit.See you at $80.",

"Nice work author in highlighting the canary in the coal mine re Ulta.   Growth stocks eventually run into the law of large numbers and cannot grow as a % at the same levels they once did even though they may be growing on an absolute basis.  Some expand their geographic footprint either in N America or internationally.  Some expand product categories.  Some enhance their business model to grow income despite slowing sales.  It appears, Ulta hasn't done enough of any of that to stem the growth decline; hence their stock suffers.  Throw in the Amazon/Macy's/Sephora overhang which leads to more uncertainty.I would ask the author to comment on what he believes is the right entry point for the shares given the reality he just discussed.  And if scale or anything else can enhance profit to such an extent that slower growth rates can be absorbed.  Or if the company is not spending capital to the extent they did in the past, could that be used to offer a dividend or to back back shares.  Or if commerce growth rates can overcome slower brick and mortar expansion.

"Some good points in the article regarding the slowdown of revenue growth. They are still growing pretty fast though, so the selloff was excessive in my opinion.I am bullish on ULTA and bought stock in around the ~230 range. Currently holding at a loss. I also bought some 2020 leaps after the stock had dropped a bit more.The main reason I am bullish: Tax reform doesn’t seem to have been priced in by the market at all. They are currently paying a very high tax rate, and going down to 21% will add 100 million to annual net income going forward.Combined with their stock buybacks, this should increase EPS by almost 50% in 2018.",
"This author is long M, which has worse fundamentals in my opinion. Ulta has just become the ugly step child right now and it will be back to 250 by summer/ early fall. Buy low. Be patient. They have no debt, great growth, and a wonderful forward thinking CEO. Ulta hasn't even touched foreign markets yet.",
"Got to fundamentally disagree with the author here.Since 2011, EBITDA margins have increased from 13% of sales to 18%, revenue has grown by 22.2% CAGR, and EBITDA 29.5% CAGR.When I did a DCF of Ulta's cashflows, I said:-  suppose margins stop rising and flatline. - suppose SSS and store  growth slows, to a 5 year revenue CAGR of more like 15.7% CAGRUsing a discount rate of 10% (my targeted return), and an exit multiple of just 10.5x EV/EBITDA we get to a share price of about $270.00.Fact of the matter is I think my assumptions are pretty modest - this business historically has traded for much higher multiples than my exit, which implies a terminal growth rate of about 4%.Despite the author not really mentioning Ulta's valuation, it is quite cheap.25x trailing earnings, but with tax reform (their 2017 tax rate was almost 40%) and earnings growth, forward estimates look paltry in comparison, at just 19x forward estimates.The PEG is 1.04. Incredible. I think people will be upset if they miss the current price opportunity.I am long, and plan on adding at current prices.Good luck!",

The gloom on this stock  - at least according to the posts here - is pretty thick.

But I did read a recent Barron's article saying the stock had 40% upside. (It was at 35 and change when article came out.)I'm dripping.

"A weak article, IMV - the author is much too optimistic about GSK's ability to sustain its dividend and about its treatment pipeline.The figures in the fourth paragraph that show free cash flow covering the dividend do not accord with what I see in the Q4 and annual results released by GSK on Feb. 7, according to which FCF was £3.4 billion in 2017 versus dividends paid of £3.91 billion. And the reference to GSK's commitment to the dividend in the same paragraph seems bizarre to me when Emma Walmsley has been very consistent since becoming CEO in saying that going forward, the financing needs of GSK's business will be the top priority for use of capital and the dividend will come second.I am happy to have sold my GSK shares in late September after holding for almost a decade. For anyone thinking of buying into this one, my suggestion is to wait for the dividend cut and drop in the share price.",
"Any discussion of Glaxo's dividend should mention the fact that GSK has a joint venture with Novartis and Novartis has a ""put"" option whereby NVS can require GSK to buy out their share.  In that case, GSK would have to come up with at least $10 billion and that might mean a reduced dividend.  The market is discounting this possibility.",
Like a number of other commenters above I'm also dubious about GSK's ability to grow its earnings and dividend.  I have a relatively small position so it's not a big deal for me if they do cut but unless some of the fundamentals improve reasonably quickly I will probably exit on the back of any future rally.  Good article BTW.,
One of my dogs. I appreciate your article and hope you buy more so that I can take my linking come early December.,
I think there are too many people drinking the GSK cool aid. The dividend is in danger and could get cut. I waited for years for this stock to do something and it’s only gone down. What are your thoughts on what the share price will do when the dividend is cut?  Not saying that it will but is very concerning.,
take the dividend and wait for this baby to come thru it's pipeline...,
I think it's a buy to 50 and a sell at or near 66.  But at around $40 is a fairly valued company if the dividend continues.,
"Thanks for the analysis, Individual Trader, but I am not sold on the price target.GSK is one of my '?'-Holdings - it has a good dividend but a lot of questions such as:1. Which of the 3 businesses (Pharma, Vaccines, Consumer Goods) should it push most?Vaccines have low competition but for a reason - even more political than Pharma. But they are a leader there, together with Sanofi.In Pharma they have a good respiratory and (indirectly but controlled) HIV Franchise - the latter especially valuable as chronicle diseases need permanent medication. Competition?. Their R&D did not shoot the lights out recently and is half the size of say Roche or Novartis. They do have a stable of 'old' medicines that lost patent protection but still can be sold lucratively and with some pricing power provided by the GSK brand. ConsumerHere you are free to move and they built good brands and  bulked up by the Novartis deal a few years ago. Grow more for instance by buying the Pfizer business or too expensive?The CEO is from this stable - but is taking a balanced = uninspiring view.2. They struggle to fund the excessive dividend. They paid out more than they earned for years and explained that away as special situations. They are levered up quite a bit but may not - no longer have a tobacco like franchise to play the lever up to enhance ROE game. So what gives?I hear you saying the dividend is safe - but it always it right up to the moment where it is cut.3. They got caught in a lot of corrupt practices in recent years. You would hope that is in the rear view mirror. But who knows really?4. Pharma increasingly rides / funds itself on politics  - and there is this mood: OK Pharma is likely  the most cost effective part of the medical moloch, hence we need to save there and not where the real big costs (but also voter and $powered special interests) are. Political 'logic' is net working against the Pharma - first everywhere outside the U:S. and now there too.5. Health industry conglomerates like JNJ, Bayer, Novartis and GSK are out of favor compared to focused approaches - because they cannot tell 'the' story.So I hold GSK as a diversifier while they pay me well, but there is no enthusiasm and quite a bit of doubt - fear of rot showing up. Then again it has been a go nowhere stock for 15 or so years - but it did not collapse either and it is defensive compared to what is so favored at the moment - so it may relatively shine more when volatility makes you feel sick with regards to FANG and the like...kinds regardsNIcklaas",
"Not much in this article or the comments which usually have more information than the article.  I feel that GSK will continue to do what it has always done and adjust its dividend to meet whatever it intends to do.  It is my third largest holding and I will continue to hold for that dividend which has been generous, especially with that extra dividend in March which I have received twice since 2003.",
A part of the weakness is also the fear that GSK will buy the OTC business of Pfizer. They would have to take on a lot of debt to accomplish this. Also that debt may bring the current dividend into question.,

So how does it make financial and economic sense to shift resources from high to low margin markets as the answer?",

It was not an accounting error; it was not an engineering failure; it was not some obscure oversight by management.  GE debacle was caused by failed leadership at the board level, as well as at the senior management ranks.  For some to suggest the managment problems are in the past with the new team and the new members of the board is mind-boggling.  Looking at the past five years, the senior managment and board members that are gone, received millions upon millions in compensation, bonuses and stock awards for having met their goals. Case in point: Jeff Immelt walked out the door with a $200 million dollar package: his side-kick, Ketih Sherin, walked away with a $17 million compensation package for 2016, so you can just imagine what his exit package was.  There is no excuse for allowing this to stand.  Flannery and his CFO Miller should be leading the effort to ""claw-back"" those monies paid out and have them restructured based on the facts, as we know them today.

Wonder how many people have noticed that the spike in opioid overdoses are do to illegally manufactured and distributed opioids and not drugs that come through the legal pipeline.That's right the same people dealing cocaine and heroin are now making and dealing other opioids. Our law enforcement seems to be as powerless against these drug dealers as ever. So they would like to find another target to distract from their failure.,

"The government pressured doctors a couple of decades ago to treat pain more aggressively and to use available medication to give adequate relief from chronic pain. Why? Because people facing lifetimes of chronic pain were committing suicide to escape the pain.Now in a society free of any sense of self responsibility we have a drug problem that is mostly a supply side and control issue the government is scaring physicians into not writing opioids because they don't want to be unfairly ""investigated"". When the people that need them can't get them you can point to the irrational blame and scare tactics of state and federal governments as the reason for suicides.The government has decided to go after legal pharmaceutical manufacturers where they figure they can at least get money being as they have been totally incapable of controlling illegal drugs where they can't make any money.",

"There is a side to this story that you and others fail to understand and report on. The FDA and other medical societies a decade ago worked to address the issue of pain management. It was determined that we were not doing a good enough job at pain management. Patients with uncontrolled pain have a harder time healing, pain can cause high blood pressure among other issues in patients and there is the end of life issues such as patients suffering from terminal cancer. The push to provide greater pain management was a multifaceted approach from many side of the healthcare field. This approach has worked for patients who need pain control. In addition, you must consider the dynamics in which many physicians in this country function. As too many of those who report on these issues live and report from major cities where healthcare options are numerous, you fail to understand the issues facing rural America. There are many, many physicians who are forced to treat patients in these areas due to a chronic lack of specialty care, the inability of patients to drive to access specialty care and/or the inability (attitude) of patients to accept a referral away from there country physician. These people trust their local doctor and prefer for them to treat vs traveling to see a physician they do not know. In the end these physician end up treating more advanced diseases then a city physician would do. For example a rural physician will treat a patients pain who has pancreatic cancer. You cannot point the finger at one issue, one company, one group of providers. This is a complex issue and in the end we need to ensure that patients do not suffer, we need to ensure that pain is not a deterrent healing.

"@Jonathan Cooper,Thank you very much for a fact-filled article on Apple.  I do wish that you did not emphasize that Apple is a one-product company.  Apple is a multi-product company that has one product that has been amazingly successful.  The two statements have very different implications.  Let me explain why.The problem with saying that Apple is a one-product company is that people then measure Apple’s performance solely by iPhone sales.  So, when Apple’s iPhone unit sales did not increase in 2017 compared to 2016, its stock fell by over 10% because every body assumed that Apple as a whole did not grow.  In reality, as you point out, that Apple had its best quarter ever.  Apple’s iPhone unit sales did not increase during the Christmas quarter compared to last year for three reasons.  First, the iPhone X was not introduced until November. Second, the Christmas quarter had 12 weeks in 2017 compared to 13 weeks in 2016, 2% difference.  Third, people were waiting for the iPhone X and held off buying the iPhone 8/8+.  But, even so, 2017 unit sales was 214.9 million compared to 216.1 million in 2016, less that 0.5% difference. Nevertheless, everybody jumped to the conclusion that Apple iPhone sales had tanked and the only reason that Apple’s revenues were the best ever was because of average sales price of Apple went from $695 to $796. But the increased ASP of iPhones accounted for only a portion of the revenue growth.  The rest came from increased iPad, Mac, and other sales.  2018 will be a banner year for Apple because the 2018 Christmas quarter will have 13 weeks and because it introduced three new products that only minimally contributed to 2017 but will have a large impact on 2018, i.e. the iPhone X, the iMac Pro, and the HomePod.  If iPad, MacBook Pro, Watch, Service, and AirPod continue to grow at double digit rates, overall Apple’s revenues will grow at double digit rates.Finally, many comments here suggest that there is a “law of big numbers” that should be applied to Apple.  This so-called Law is simply not applicable to Apple.  Apple is nowhere close to saturating its market for any of its products.  For example, in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, Apple only has a 19% share.  There is plenty of room for growth.  In the service division, Apple Music subscription rates is currently less than 5% of the 1.3 billion active iOS devices in the world.  Again, there is plenty of room for growth.",

"Good article.  However I would like to make a single correction to the comment that Apple sold fewer iPhone in FQ1/2018 than it did in FQ1/2017.  In reported numbers for the period there were fewer iPhones sold this year, however, when sales are normalized for the number of weeks in the period FQ1/2018 (13 weeks) sold 4.973 million more iPhones than Apple did in FQ1/2017 (14 weeks).Looking at iPhone sales during the December quarter, per sales week, paints a much different narrative about iPhone sales, especially when you take into account the massive increase in iPhone ASP.At a time when the industry is cutting each others throat with aggressive pricing The overall industry saw a decline in handset sales.  The only exception was Apple's iPhone that not only saw 6.35% increase in per week unit sales but also saw a 14.56% increase ASP.",

I think we forget that in 2014 Apple changed form factors when the iPhone 6 and 6+ was introduced. This drove sales like crazy. Now its just the same ole same. I think a X+ or whatever they will call it will be another blockbuster. Especially if they can bring it an at the current X price ($999). Or even just non-OLED with the bigger screen as rumored.,

"I it’s all about the ECOSYSTEM! Anyone who doesn’t understand that has no business investing in technology. Apple ,Alphabet, Amazon, Cisco , and all the rest want you in their web! It’s pretty simple really. Hard to get out once you are in The Apple web",
"Your conclusions are reasonable.  The market is seldom reasonable.   If it were, Apple would already be at 200.  Amazon is a revenue company, not a profit company.  Alphabet sells air, not hardware.    Apple sells a comprehensive system of many varied, profitable, and interlocking parts and is beyond a threshold of performance that I think few market participants perceive.     As in the early days of flight when the sound barrier was broken, everyone worried about the stress at mach 1, but once beyond that, the air was smooth and quiet, an entirely different fluid.      There is so much going on AT Apple that we know nothing of.  No serious economic barrier to pursuing whatever they want to pursue, using the best talent, materials, and tools available.  They aren't struggling to be innovative.      They are putting the last pieces of a puzzle together and most of the other folks in their little niche markets have either just opened the box or managed to get the easy edge pieces organized.    It's really not much of a contest, unless the criteria for success is units shipped and not profit made.   Not much of a business plan in my opinion.Good article.  Thanks.",

"Apple sold fewer iPhones in 2017 than they did in 2016? it depends on who answers. Statistahttp://tinyurl.com/yce...says otherwise. However, the difference in numbers is small, Apple unit sales are flat. Period.This is not very good because up to and including 2015 unit sales grew in double digits. It can be explained with ""longer refresh cycles"" or, with logically more direct but psychologically  less pleasant, ""market saturation"" a.k.a. drying out influx of switchers. In plain English both mean ""less interest"".With the most fun parts of MWC 2018 already experienced, it is evident that in 2018 there are less reasons to switch from Android to iOS than there were in 2017. Unless you are with Apple in some other way. And that other way leaves Macs and iPads.That is, if indeed ""Apple is primarily a one product company"", and especially if it continues to be, the only way forward for Apple is to milk their user base dry. Some markets will dry out sooner, like Chinese where only half of iPhone owners plan to purchase iPhone again, some later like America and Japan. Interestingly, inelegant force methods are ALREADY necessary to keep Chinese manufacturers away from the US market.I hate articles, and, sorry to say that, comments also, that say ""hey, Apple is doing well because iPhone is doing well and that will continue all by itself for the rest of the eternity."" It will not continue all by itself. Apple is working hard and earning their margins and  ASP one day at a time. If Apple stops, flat iPhone will be replaced first with declining iPhone and next with the finita la commedia exit strategy.The problem is Apple continues to work. Thus, absolutely correct inertia based forecasts of Apple's doom are wrong every time. It is pointless to compare prices of different iPhone. Apple has lost the ability to control sales with price or SE would be the best selling iPhone. Apple bulls like to point to the iPhone ASP that is 3+ times larger than Android Phone ASP. Exactly. Price controls nothing unless Apple cuts it in half.So, ""2018 promises to be even better, building on both the iPhone X and the iPhone 5C."" Yes, promises. No, building on Apple's efforts outside iPhone.",

"Recommendation to the bears on this board - read what Ballie says here about the long term possibilities  of Tesla:http://tinyurl.com/y75...Many decades ago the investor Philip Fisher famously articulated the philosophy of so-called “growth” stock investing. In his investment classic, “Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits” — a book cited by Warren Buffett, among others — Fisher said that the real way to make big money in investing is to find outstanding companies and then just hang on forever.Recent academic research has found something similar: A small number of big long-term winners have provided most of the stock market’s overall long-term gains.Baillie Gifford’s own calculations find that, historically, over a typical five-year period about 80% of stocks end up a wash: They’ve either gone down a bit, or up a bit, and overall you haven’t made much money. Your gains come from the rest.“The remaining 20% go up at least 150%,” says Robinson. He believes there’s still a good chance Tesla could be in that 20% category over the next five years.“Equity returns are asymmetric,” he adds. “You have limited downside and uncapped upside. We think the path to success is to ... identify and hold on to those winners.” The quest is for “exceptional growth companies ... they are, by definition, rare.”",

As the other high end mfrs come out with their competition to the model S and X, this will force Tesla to re-fresh.  I am only a casual observer of Tesla so I defer to those who follow more closely to answer this question.  That said, I am reminded how they re-fresh the roadster and delivered it as a surprise when they unveiled the Semi-Truck.  Could a model S re-fresh be in the works now?",

"How do you explain their Q1 guidance of only $0.20 “adjusted” eps versus Street expectations of $0.43?? Q1 revenue also a shortfall versus expectations. Also, with revenue growth of only 2% for 2018, how can you possibly justify an 18x P/E multiple? Seems the story is fairly valued at best. Any slowdown in the broader economy later this year, and the stock will find itself back to $20 or below. In general, look at the cyclicality of the long-term chart: the pattern is very clear to buy shares below $20 and sell above $50.

Another point to consider is Mallinckrodt: They spent 20m to buy a stake in Mesoblast and have a 9 months option to negotiate commercial agreements but they let it expire. That does not sound promising. But recent news looks good with products advancing. Tricky situation to understand,
great article. I agree that Meso is starting to get closer to look very interesting with a broad patent portfolio on MLCs cells. I am not sure about the valuation yet because at about 600m and still burning cash is quite a high valuation. Upside could be decent if everything goes without bad surprises but I a bit disappointed by their IR that never replied to my questions for example and also another thing is that that never mention that their best asset at the moment MSC 100v is under license from Osyris wth royalties and milestone payments of up to 100m if approved and commercialised. Reading their last nice presentation sounds like they own the whole asset and in fact they only licensed out Japan to JCR which is going well and selling decently,

He travels within Florida as well as Georgia and possibly the Carolinas and Alabama (as I recall from recent conversations with him). He’s management and oversees negotiations with those that are purchasing the equipment as well as the construction of said facilities. He’s told me that 5G is real and it is coming very soon. I know that others have mentioned this in the past but it was made real to me by my convos over a beer with said cousin when he was up visiting this winter (believe it or not but Floridians love experiencing a taste of NE winter on occasion!)). Anyway, my point here is as a long in SIRI since 2005, I never worried that there would be challengers to the service that SIRI provides until now. Tack on connected cars and 5G, and having it become ubiquitous around the country in the coming decade and I wonder just how much strength SIRI will still have. I now think about how the 4 big service providers (Verizon, ATT, Sprint, T-Mobile) are investing HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS over time in 5G and will then have billions more once this goes into effect to then invest into the content that will be distributed through this future network. Again, the ubiquitousness (if that’s a word) will take a decade or so; I don’t see an immediate threat. But I also don’t know that I can feel that SIRI will have a stranglehold on content in the future that it currently holds compared to what’s out there now.

Coachella on You Tube this past Sat afternoon had approx 36,300 people watching while I was, for free; on just one of the smaller stages and it was an unknown act (who was really great fun, a form of dub or trance hop, from Europe).  This stream runs for weeks as Coachella now does... I can state that the age of Couch Tour formthe masses outside of the Jam scene... have arrived ! It's exciting for some of us and will be for many more... the interactivity that can be added to the experience will help make it more popular as a majority of music is already consumed over You Tube (visual audio) globally contracted via TIVO as I like to mention as it was a great call and perfect example of research paying off in the Parts, Patents and Brands stock picking philosophy.

If you download the Sirius app on an Amazon FireStick you are directed to see other apps, music from the entire internet; that can be cast to any speaker. Visually, it's a small leap to include live streams for couch touring on the app. You Tube does it for free at the moment, Sirius does it for subs, Nugs.tv and the like charge anywhere from per month to per concert (10-40$). The penny stock that spawned Bamtech; called Neulion; who has international sporting rights to stream the leagues and soccer, and soon music and other media; was finally bought by a private group that is a mini LYV... very much worth following the next moves.

What many of us investors are now aware of is Sirus really needs to lower their monthly charge to customers. Using the teaser rate of $5.00 per month for 5 month then charging $12.00 or more there after is ending up costing them loss of clients. We have 3 vehicles which had Sirus in them. And when we could not get a more reasonable rate we canceled. So Sirus lost 3 accounts right off the bat. Now I have heard from friends and clients they too have cancelled their their accounts where there was 1 to 3 cars. If Sirus keeps loosing accounts they will be history. Instead of using a bate and switch to get customers. Just charge one low rate across the board. For me to have to pay $144.00 per year per car for radio just made no sense > $432.00 can be used for better things.,

Every family / friend of mine that has a PA owned this stock & minted some cheddar. Bud is finally deploying that balance sheet and taking advantage of that stockpile of cash and a fistful of life insurance policies.Personally, I think it is still an interesting story but I think the stock has gotten ahead of itself. It was extremely interesting as a low downside bet on balance sheet deployment @ $5 with half of its book value in life insurance+ cash run by a bunch of conservative gray hairs, but now its a show me story. Its a staffing / services business, don't let that Paris deal fool you. They will probably get to 50 cents in EPS in 2019/20, but its inorganic, a function of balance sheet deployment via M&A + buybacks & the latter is questionable from after the recent rally. 16 x T+2 EPS is on the high end of what the business is worth today given some execution risk & a mediocre core business.",Computer Task Group: Buy This Turnaround

Why has Cometriq had such a reduction in sales?,
"The valuation is not really derived from recent growth but from the prospects of Cabo label expansion (1L RCC / HCC / etc.) and additional Cobi indications.  For Cabo, one can get to $1B in annual revenues despite competitive headwinds.  Beyond that, the pipeline is really weak.  It reminds me of an earlier investment of mine, Onyx, which was purchased after its two drugs secured approvals in attractive spaces (ironically one in HCC).  EXEL is probably best served by being purchased but there will likely be a limit to what the buyer is willing to pay.",

"Another great buying opportunity presented to everyone.Based on the Powel testimony, WFC only needs to prove that it is taking actions to correct their operational deficiencies. So, I would expect this growth constraint to be lifted within the next 2-3 months",
Did the Fed impose a fine on WFC? The answer is NO. It was just a slap on the wrist by Janet Yellen on her last day in the office so this tells me that it was about political situation that both sides wanted to close the scandal.This is a great article written by the author. I agree with the analysis from the author. I already own WFC stock bought many years ago. I added more to my portfolio when couple weeks ago during the fake 10% correction.

Dividends attractive. Good time for WFC to buy back stock.,

Your positive view seems predicated on the proposition that WFC will not be involved in future regulatory action.  The next time you talk to management why don’t you ask them if they have created FAKE accounts with Benefit Finance relating to the payment of Long Term compensation to recently retired long term employees who had no involvement in the retail banking issues. Why are they not paying retirees what they are owed but indicating on quarterly statements handled by third party Benefit Finance that amounts were distributed when they were not. Where are the regulators on this one? Maybe you should hold off on buying the stock until they really clean house.,
I don’t understand why you would use that high of a premium to tangible book value without adjusting for control premium. 4% upside is not worth writing an article about!,

Huawei and Nokia are neck and neck with 22% and 21%, respectively, followed by ZTE, Qualcomm, Samsung, Intel and others in a snapshot that obviously includes a mixed bag of players.I dont trust analysts, they don't understand 5G.",
"""Pressure will also grow on the European Union, which is in charge of telecommunications law, to lighten the regulatory burden for network operators. Politicians may even start calling for protectionist measures. “If Ericsson and Nokia in Europe benefited from the same support as Huawei and ZTE in China, they’d be fine,”""As a result, Ericsson and Nokia now look much alike. They have the same number of employees (about 100,000), make similar-sized profits in their networks business (gross margins of 30-40%) and have similar market capitalisations. But differences remain, which seem to favour Nokia. It is with some justification that Mr Suri calls his firm “the Western alternative to Huawei”—its product portfolio is broader than Ericsson’s, and includes gear for fixed networks. Some also consider Nokia more innovative: it inherited Bell Labs, a respected laboratory where the transistor was invented, from Alcatel Lucent. Mr Suri has big plans to use artificial intelligence to make Nokia more efficient, for instance in drafting offers to build smaller networks.""http://econ.st/2GbKMmt""Analysts at Raymond James say it’s too early to call winners, but clearly Ericsson, Huawei and Nokia dominate the wireless infrastructure market.

"AH,""I have not once heard management how it will tackle sales/margin assaults from wrecked Ericsson and relentless Huawei et al.""On this point I agree with you.  Does Nokia have a strategic plan to address this problem?  It would be naive to think that they didn't.  And if they do, why would they tell the world, the competition, their game plan?  In regard to ASN, by keeping the cable laying subsidiary and working with Facebook  on fiber-optic transoceanic 5G speed and latency transmission Nokia has gained a valuable customer for other areas of 5G equipment sales. Also, the ASN business of placing fiber-optic cables across ocean beds is still a very viable business and ASN holds the majority of market position.  Yes, the sale price of HERE was a disappointment, but they are now partners with Audi in placing telecom equipment on the moon  (great PR, unknown marketing or future revenue benefit), and a much more tangible benefit is their joint work to develop automotive 5G communication with the consortium that purchased HERE. The cashflow also helped Nokia to maintain a high level of R&D.OZO was a bust. I believe the venture into AI/VR will still have some benefit down the road.Withings goodwill was written down last year.  Why has Nokia failed to gain traction in the wearable healthcare market?  I don't know, but Nokia's work with Healthcare providers, such as hospitals, insurance companies and University research staff,  most certainly will help with IOT sales of connectivity equipment and software.""It sounds as if Nokia comment threads have reached GoPro or FitBit levels of quality.""

"Taken a long-term perspective (i.e. 5-7 years), in the lower-for-longer world of more shale, more renewables and more EVs, the next cyclical high will probably be different than the previous...  But assuming supply&demand is balanced and the oil price averages around $60-70, and further assuming day-rates of UDW rigs can recover to say $250-300k (i.e. half of what they used to be), to what extent will companies like ESV be able to reach their previous highs in profits, cash flows and essentially shareprice?A lot of variables, but has anyone modelled this?Clearly the drillers, like most other oil service companies, have also been able to cut costs significantly such that even in a lower oil price environment, they would be able to thrive, particularily those companies with modern fleets, who do not need to invest huge sums for many years to come...Any views?",

There are more reasons to worry as industry participants are once again showing reluctance to scrap more rigs, as already evidenced by the recent conference calls of Transocean and Noble. This way, the brutal oversupply will not abate anytime soon and 2019 might turn out almost equally disappointing in the end.Personally, I do not expect materially increased dayrates in the deepwater space until the 2020/2021 time frame.",

"Most people are fearful during the best times to buy cyclical stocks (like oil stocks). A careful reading of what savvy insiders are saying shows that many of them have started saying that they are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. Many of these best-in-class owners and managers were rightly negative on their industry's prospects for years during the downturn we have been experiencing. Two examples: Tracv Krohn, a 35+ year offshore veteran, and the founder and CEO of W&T Offshore (an independent Exploration and Production company) bought 2,671,190 shares of WTI stock in late August and September of 2017 - an investment of $5,182,108! His average price was $1.94. Amid the continuing gloom, Mr. Krohn has more than doubled his money - and his company stock is still near rock bottom.  Mr. Krohn put his money where his mouth was - and made another in his long series of very savvy calls on offshore oil and gas. Todd Hornbeck, the founder and CEO of Hornbeck Offshore Services (operator of the most modern fleet of offshore support vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere) had been negative on offshore oil and gas for years in his quarterly reports to shareholders. Yet in his latest earnings call comments, Mr. Hornbeck says that he believes we are seeing the first glimmers of a cyclical turnaround. The company - for the first time since the downturn took hold in earnest - was able to bank some cash in the fourth quarter! Though some long-term competitors have filed for bankruptcy (Gulfmark, Tidewater Marine, for example), Hornbeck Offshore has managed to keep its head above water and could emerge in a stronger position than ever, compared to its competition. I believe that persons who buy offshore oil and gas stocks now will be substantially rewarded. (Full disclosure: I have bought some offshore oil and gas stocks lately)",

"Actually, I bought AKORN this afternoon at $17.11. The purchase was only for a 1,000 shares and it was not based upon this article. I simply looked back to see what AKRX was trading at when this Deal was announced last April 2017. The stock was around $23 before the Deal, so I figured even if Fresenius somehow backs out that at $17 the Company (AKRX) is now priced 30% lower than the day the Deal was announced. I have seen an Analyst call for single digits ($8), but the stock was $23 long before the Deal was announced. So for folks to say this company will drop to $8 seems to be an over reaction of an extreme magnitude. I will sit tight on my small investment of $17,000 (1,000 shares) and if by some chance it goes thru, I will reap close to a 100% profit for holding 2 more months (April 2018). Best case scenario, it closes, worst case it does not and either stays at $17, or drops lower (to be determined), or returns to Pre Deal share price of $23.

It could be that Fresenius wants out of this deal. - It could even be people wanting to pick up more shares at a lower price and thus floated a false story.- It could be just rumor.- Or heaven forbid, it could be true that there was a breach.- The old adages hold here, never try to catch a falling knife and pigs get slaughtered. - Just wait a couple of weeks and see what shakes out. Yes, you might loose a few points on the upside, but if deal does go through, it will go at 34. On the other hand, this stock could go all the way down to 10 or less.",
"Below is from company's web site:Akorn Issues Statement on InvestigationLAKE FOREST, Ill., Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akorn, Inc. (Nasdaq:AKRX), a leading specialty generic pharmaceutical company, today issued the following statement:“Akorn and Fresenius Kabi AG, with the assistance of outside consultants, are investigating alleged breaches of FDA data integrity requirements relating to product development at the Company.  To date, the Company’s investigation has not found any facts that would result in a material impact on Akorn’s operations and the Company does not believe this investigation should affect the closing of the transaction with Fresenius.  The Company does not intend to provide further updates as the investigation proceeds. The Company is continuing to work to obtain regulatory clearance for the transaction.”",

"Alere was similar with problems. The deal was renegotiated to a lower price. I do not know if the buyer is interested in buying at a lower price or getting out of the deal entirely. If there is a break up fee Akorn may be entitled some compensation. The companies can end up suing each other and negotiating a new deal or getting out of the deal. I think the price was reduced less than 10%. So, the deal might go for $30 and take another year to negotiate. I have no clue as to what the data problems are. If they were faking results or shorting customers, it would be serious. If the equipment made errors due to failures it might not be as serious. Equipment does fail and data can be bad.Longer term this migt be worth an investment. But, shorts could hit it again if the deal fails completely. Maybe it could go to $15 next time the market crashes lower.",
"It's fine to make a bet on $AKRX here, but I strongly disagree with limited downside. If the deal is terminated, especially due to data integrity issues, Akorn is likely hitting single digits.

"My opinion: Will be up, tomorrow. Day traders know it's coming, long term professional analysts know that a 15-30% gain is likely from here with minimal indication of a cancelled deal, shorts made a fortune today and will lock in profits before they diminish or SUDDENLY expire entirely, and if they don’t, a short squeeze will ensue either way starting tomorrow morning. Just my two cents.  I am often wrong :-)",
"@Gio - I appreciate the article, thank you for writing it.   As is appropriate, you admitted the lack of research, and that you are simply betting on the likelihood of this investigation turning up anything material.  If not -- the stock goes back to $30 (+70%), and if so -- then it probably won't drop too much, since it was priced this high before the deal was struck.  AKRX by itself isn't worthless.IMO, the upside looks stronger than the downside.  I wish I had seen this article before the market closed  -- I probably would have bought a single position's worth, and taken this bet, and waited for it to hit $30 again within a couple weeks.   If instead it went down, likely, it wouldn't go down by that much.",

Seems like Fresenius wants out of the deal and this may be a way to do it. Supposedly no company has ever successfully used the MAC clause to terminate an acquisition agreement. But even if Frezenius pays a breakup fee it seems Akorn may be worth less than shares are currently trading.,

On top of that, TSMC has to guarantee a minimum yield to its customers.  Intel can go into mass production with lower yield than TSMC.  And Intel is still behind.4.  TSMC jumped ahead because cell phone was the tech driver.  Interesting to see what the next tech driver will be, as cell phone might be running out of gas.",
Saw one news reporting,
I sawAMD will use the facilities fromTSMC at the initial phase and then moved part of the production to GF.,

Mark I find your comment on rather having Apples business than Qualcomm's a little odd. Wouldn't TSMC rather have both companies business?

sequential quarterly decline Q4 to q1 shouldn't surprise anyone or be alarming.  We should look at the total quarter over quarter decline but also look at q1 of 2017.I suspect X and S combined demand has peaked and will decline this year.

(a) started refresh (b) picked a Model Y factory site (c) target date for shipping base Model 3 (d) more spin on current and future production levels (e) new stores to allow selling into markets X and Y [leased spaces in strip malls for sales only].

Weak analysis. Tesla moved model S&X production workers to the model 3 line during Q3. They stated production was not impacted due to increased automation and they would not be moving these works back to the SX line. Your comment about this impacting production is false,

"Here we are ... more competition arrives next year ...Porsche's US dealers will offer fast charging stations for its Tesla-fighting Mission E sedanThe first all-electric Porsche is expected to look a lot like the Mission E Concept first shown in 2015. (Porsche)SAN FRANCISCO — Porsche plans to equip its 189 U.S. dealerships with 800-volt fast-charging stations in an effort to sell its forthcoming Tesla-fighter, the Mission E electric sedan.The German automaker already has six such EV stations at its Porsche Experience Center in Atlanta, home of its North American headquarters, and plans to add more soon at its sister center in Los Angeles. Both facilities allow Porsche owners to take delivery of new vehicles as well as experience them on a track.""Charging infrastructure is an extremely important part of the EV experience as a whole,"" Porsche Cars North America CEO Klaus Zellmer said in a blog post provided to USA TODAY that will appear on the company's website Thursday.Zellmer said fast charging stations will allow the company's four-door Mission E, due sometime in 2019, to add 250 miles to its range in around 20 minutes.Zellmer noted that for the majority of their charging needs, customers ultimately would have to rely on the nation's slowly growing network of charging stations, most of which will not charge a vehicle at an accelerated pace. ""You have to keep in mind that more than 80% of charging occurs at home,"" he said.It remains unlikely that Mission E owners would be able to charge for free at dealerships. Tesla initially offered free access to its highway-based Supercharger high-speed charging stations for its Model S sedan.Stefan Weckbach, head of battery electric vehicles at Porsche, said in the blog post that the company is exploring a range of fee structures for charging, including the possibility of flat-rate options depending on demand. Weckbach also confirmed that the Mission E will not resort to digital audio gimmicks in order to replicate the company's famous engine growl, and instead will encourage owners to embrace a new series of engineering-based sounds — from tire tread noise to suspension flexing — that will be audible due to a lack of internal combustion engine. The Mission E debuted as a concept a few years ago, and while its overall design has remained intact a few nifty features won't be retained. The futuristic cameras-as-side-view-m... will not make the production model due to a range of regulations in many of Porsche's key markets, including the U.S.But the sedan's ""suicide doors"" — rear doors from the back — are still shown as being part of the package in recent photos proffered by the company.Porsche plans to build the Mission E at the company's headquarters in Zuffenhausen, Germany, just outside of Stuttgart (some of its other models are built in factories in Leipzig, Germany). That decision means Porsche ""will need to recruit well over 1,000 new production and development employees,"" said Weckbach.The Volkwagen Group bought Porsche in 2012, adding it to a stable of brands that also includes Lamborghini, Bentley and Audi. Porsche executives say the Mission E will leverage the technological innovations developed across the VW Group while retaining a distinctive Porsche feel.A broad spectrum of automakers and technology companies are targeting self-driving cars in the coming years, specifically as part of ride-sharing services.The VW Group recently partnered with a new Silicon Valleystartup called Aurora, which is developing self-driving car hardware and software and is run by former Google car lead engineer Chris Urmson.But don't look for a self-driving Mission E. The company has no plans to automate the sporty sedan. Instead, it will add driver-assist features that can help in traffic situations.""Porsche drivers want to drive,"" said Weckbach, adding that ""no one believes that cars will be able to drive themselves completely in the short or medium term.""While a range of automakers are vowing to add many electric models to their line-ups, Porsche's sports car heritage makes its Mission E a true competitor to the Model S, which boasts a lofty price, wicked acceleration and an exclusive caché. Porsche's first all-electric model should be priced the same as the current Panamera sedan: $100,000, which is also about the cost of some upper-level Model S sedans. It will have a 400-mile range compared to the Tesla’s sedans 315 miles, and will hit a top speed of 155 mph, about the same as the Model S.Porsche cars have long been lauded for innovative gasoline engines, but now the company is doubling down on electrification.Beyond committing to the Mission E, Porsche also shocked the racing community last year by pulling out of France's 24 Hours of Le Mans, one of the world's most famous endurance races, which it had won repeatedly with hybrid-engine technology. Instead, the automaker plans to field a new race car in 2019 for the electric car series, Formula E.Follow USA TODAY technology writer Marco della Cavaon Twitter.",

"OK small digression:I drive a second hand Audi 1.8 CE cabriolet in Cape Town, where there are amazing roads and v few police or speed traps.This car has all the acceleration I could ever imagine I need. I can leave virtually anyone behind from a traffic light goin green. Yes, this sometimes gives me a thrill, but it's very rare that the traffic/road trajectory ahead permits it. (But far more imp than the acceleration, is the fact my 60 kilo Saint Bernard, Bambina, with the cab roof down, just looks too cool for words with her ears flapping in the rushing wind. In other words the acceleration does not rank even in the top 20 of my preferences)So : I am just bewildered - flummoxed even - at how much trumpeting TSLA does from going to 0 - 100 km/h in 3 (or is it 2 seconds = my dream audi 1.8 cc car = 5 seconds).I mean in the first world, with far more regulation and traffic, how OFTEN CAN ONE ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM THIS???

Tesla did something similar recently when they claimed they had asked “base model” pre-order model 3 customers to configure their car.  Obviously a lie since no one who pre-ordered gave any information about what options they might or might not want since none of the option information was even available at the time xand they’ve never been asked the question,
Talk about missing the forest through the trees. Model s and x demand is up because the tax credit is going away. Same reason tesla sales surged in Hong Kong and Norway (although Norway scrapped their de incentive plan).,
It's not about the cars anymore. it's about the energy storage.. the money is there. they're making their own batteries and everything. Panasonic and tesla are on the brink of a money making machine. This summer both these stocks are jumping please someone quote me.,
The threat of subsidy loss in Norway likely pulled considerable 2018 Tesla demand into 2017.  One would expect poor demand in early 2018 but increasing competition especially the Jaguar I-Pace should be a major impediment to a Tesla recovery in Norway and a major factor in  EU Tesla demand as well.,
What doesn’t pass the smell test is thinking tesla would purposely slow model s/x production when demand is already there. Model 3 production was in worse shape months ago not now.What does make sense is 400k model 3 delivery delays and so many are going model s/x instead.,

"Tesla said on its Q4 earnings call that the giga-factory is the bottleneck that is delaying the Model 3 production.If battery pack production at the giga-factory is the bottleneck, moving personnel from S and X to Model 3 lines at Fremont will not increase Model 3 production.None of what Tesla says ever makes any sense when you think it through.",

Demand is such that, at 100K a year, there is a backlog.Investing in expanding production beyond 100k for Models S&X is not incremental, it requires a large investment to create a new line. Considering that Tesla is likely working on a new generation of batteries (as evidenced by the Semi and Roadster, which incumbents have trouble believing), it makes sense that they wouldn't sink money into more manufacturing capacity for the obsolete 18650 at this point.It's also likely that Tesla is working on a Model S and X refresh, since these need to incorporate certain technological advancements from the Model 3 to retain their position as top-of-the-line vehicles in Tesla's lineup (e.g. HVAC, less cluttered dashboard).Your article focuses on some hypothetical failing in producing Models S and X (actually you are attacking there decision not to produce more than 100k/year right away, not an actual decline), and yet Tesla will still increase its overall production of vehicles by at least 100% this year, even by conservative estimates.Once Model 3 is safely ramping up, Tesla will turn its attention back to the Model S and X lines. Not to mention the Semi, Model Y, Roadster 2, etc.And by then you will be chasing some other irrelevant thread and claiming that the sky is falling on Tesla.",
"Where's the evidence to back up the statement that ""....the demand numbers are simply not there.'? Jan/Feb Norway deliveries? You know European sales in the first month of the Qtr are always lower than previous month, don't you? That says nothing about March. Nothing about the rest of Europe. Nothing about China. ""Specifically, we know that in Q4 2017, a number of Model S and Model X line workers were transferred to the Model 3 lines.""Weren't these trainees hired for the M3 line and trained on the S/X line? ""Unsurprisingly, that has put a considerable supply constraint on Model S and Model X production capacity.""Which one are you saying: (1) Lower demand, or (2) Capacity constrained? Which is the cause and which is the effect?",
Suppliers may be holding back shipments or reducing size of shipments because of non-payment and further deterioration of company's financial position (see Q4 investor call and related SEC filings).,
The shorts have been played since IPO.Yet they always expect the imminent collapse.Ain't happening.,
It's just amazing that Tesla bulls are so gullible to fall for this kind of stuff. And then they have the pride to get out here on this blog and ADMIT that they are falling for it!,
Agreed. Musk is a flim flam man.,
"JohnEngle,>>However, this little story does matter insofar as it reveals aspects of Tesla’s tendency toward duplicity and massaging of facts – as well as to the uncritical acceptance of those massaged facts by an obedient media and analyst community. The story of increased demand can be proven false by relatively simple research, yet everyone seems willing to just take Tesla’s word for it.<<I don't find anything in your little story particularly revealing just speculation based on insufficient knowledge of Tesla's true intentions. Unless you happen to be on their board of directors you have really no idea.Significant updates to both S and X are coming this year. Just because Tesla hasn't fully revealed them you assume its some cover up from Tesla?Since when does any company much less Tesla fully reveal their business strategies?Perhaps you can comment on when the switch from 18650 to 2170 in S/X will occur and what the implications will have toward demand, production, and vehicle specs.There's hints out there but you're obviously looking the other way to suit your investment narrative. Hey no problem, there's an avalanche of such speculation and its at least as common behavior for shorts as longs. Lots of pot calling kettle black but lets just say it's all complacent analysts, media, institutional investors, tesla faithful, whatever. Convenient! Very convenient.Hint: The specs on refreshed S and X  and AWD M3 will be significantly better much to the chagrin of shorts.Hint: Model 3 buzz in Tesla stores has actually brought in more demand for current S/X which is sure to increase when refresh hits later this year. Will also be lot of buzz sure to mysteriously levitate stock price but you already know that. Good luck with your short position.Wouldn't it be amazing if for once Tesla guided to the low end in S/X sales--how would that effect stock price?",
"It is called ‘talk your book’ and as soon as you understand that the western media speaks with one voice these days you see the opportunities. Uncritical is not the word, they are complicit, or better, the media created the lie around Musk.His fake returning rockets are cgi, his roadster in space is greenscreen, where are the stars?, and nobody is critical. You are watching a reality soap. Unfortunately my view is outside most people’s paradigm and that is why it works.",
TESLA is probably playing the game of dragging out the magical 200K delivery date to July which would start when tax credits for buyers start dropping.  Many have speculated TESLA will try to drag out US deliveries until the first week of the third quarter to reach that number to maximize the benefit to buyers.,
I just configured a new P100D in the design studio - it said 1-2 months,
"As far as a Google search reveals, the tax benefits for Tesla's (known as a Tesla Tax) were to be dropped in 2018, rendering the EV cars susceptible to import duty and VAT (currently exempt).However the scrapping was banned in Dec '17.SO,the huge ramp up in Norway's 4q 17 was in anticipation of the tax benefit being removed.IT HASNTAND DEMAND has fallen off a cliff.This points to one irrefutable fact: That Nordes pulled forward their Tesla purchases into 4q 17, fearing the scrapping of tax benefit in '18. Note this tax benefit was big: $10-20 K.So we now have the consequence of the pulled forward demand - the slump which will last for 1h '18. I guesstimate 200 per month a far cry from 4q 17.( =900 /MONTH)IMO the 2H of Norway Tesla sales MIGHT gravitate back to the 1h of 2017 = around 300 per month,So we have one helluva fjord to fill in this year....",
This is what an automated Mercedes assembly line looks like.

In the past month I see a lot of Tesla cars around the production/assembly line in Tilburg (the Netherlands). Maybe   they shipped a lot of cars to Europe. As far as I can see a few cars are standing there for weeks already. Maybe a big shipment to Europe is the cause of the waiting times in the US? Fact is that Tesla does what it can to hide what they are doing.,

"There is another possibility.  There could have been a sort of reverse Osborne effect.  Those contemplating trading down to Model 3 may have decided to stick with Model S/X not wishing to wait for eventual production or risk well documented quality issues.  As John Engle states, ""[t]he company has no intention of expanding supply, even if there were actually increased demand.""  While this is true, if demand actually is stronger for the time being, then prices for Models S/X may be firmer than they have been and gross margins might be higher in the 1st quarter for Models S/X than anticipated.  Of course this could mean higher cancellation rates / lower new order rates for Model 3.  I come at this from a short standpoint and I'm not looking at this as a short term trade.  Nonetheless, I like to be prepared for all eventualities.",

"That is how shorts get fooled into shorting more. The reality is that the wait lines for the S and X are increasing and they will go though the roof when refresh is avail. 2012-2013-2014 owners (total about 100,000) will buy a new car.

"Management issues do not change the efficacy of Rayaldee. Sales will increase significantly. ""Currently administered vitamin D hormone replacement therapies are plagued with safety issues that limit the doses that can be administered and, therefore, limit efficacy. These therapies include doxercalciferol, paricalcitol and calcitriol. When administered at high intravenous doses (which are required to treat more advanced SHPT), the current therapies produce supraphysiological surges in blood and intracellular levels of vitamin D hormones, resulting in significant aberrations in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. As a result, few CKD patients are able to meet the iPTH, serum calcium, and serum phosphorus targets set out by the K/DOQI clinical practice guidelines. In addition, these surges cause a strong upregulation in intracellular CYP24A1 enzyme. Over-expression of CYP24A1 causes destruction of both the administered therapy as well as any residual endogenous 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Chronic use of current therapies can lead to treatment “resistance”, which results from prolonged elevation of intracellular levels of CYP24A1"".I closed out Opko call options after the negative response letter form the FDA for manufacturing deficiencies when the share price was around $10.

More short nonsense.... though I do not expect good numbers from BioReference this is a turnaround story. At current levels and under such dark clouds any positive catalyst will cause a significant sp pop. I have encouraged Opko to follow the lead of Athersys which tracked down the true identity/author of an SA article. If there should be false/misleading info Opko (like Athersys) should pursue the author through the legal system. The author in that case was already in litigation over a similar incident and Athx also turned information they had uncovered over to Nasdaq and the SEC officials....in addition to their own legal team.

"Thanks Trent for the follow up with HCLP. I've been tracking the company / researching them since July and I have to say that I've been extremely impressed with management's ability to execute. Management has shown great discipline and I'm very happy to be a unit holder. Through my DD, I think this company is the ""darling"" out of all of the frac sand companies. 1st mover advantage in the Permian is key for them. They not only opened 2 months ahead of schedule, but the company has long term contracts on 90% of their sand. 80% long term contracts on Northern White from Wisconsin. I didn't realize this until the last CC, but the company could build another facility at Kermit to increase the supply. They already own the land, and have the reserves for it. That being said, I appreciate how the company isn't continuing to ramp on CapEx for 2018. I think they will be buying back units ~$20M for quarter with free cash flow. I think their Pecos Terminal is top notch as well. This only opened this past October and I would expect margins to increase from Pecos operations. October 31st, 2016 the company announced it's strategic investment into PropX (http://www.PropX.com) of ~$17.4m dollars over the next 12-18 months. As of this past Q I think they still had ~$6.5m to invest. HCLP had 10 PropStream crews at the end of Q4 and plan to have 20 by the end of FY18. Each crew accounts for $1.5m in EBITDA on an annualized basis. I'm not sure what % of PropX HCLP owns, but I would say it's a significant amount. Wall Street needs to stop thinking on a quarterly basis. If the company ""misses"" by a few cents who cares. Look at the sequential improvement along with it's annual YOY improvements. There is no doubt that this company will be paying out an increased distribution each quarter. The company is digesting it's growth very well and think it will acquire logistic sand companies that make sense with their operations as they see it fit. Investors definitely aren't showing any  appreciation for what the company has built on the logistics side. One day they will.... I will continue to hold my position and collect the dividend and have the 70-100%+ increase in share price over the next 12 months if the company continues to execute. Long Shares.",

(FMSA). This is for a couple different reasons. First, Hi-Crush has a best in class logistics system that other companies can't compete with. It owns a lot of the terminals it uses to ship sand by rail across the U.S., resulting not only in cost savings the competition can't match, but it also gains priority status at those terminals in shipping sand.”Why do you insist on spreading misinformation?  SLCA’s and FMSA’s logistics are far more extensive than Hi-Crush. Each has more rail cars, terminals and last mile logistic solutions than Hi-Crush. In addition, US Silica has Sandbox for last mile delivery, which is growing quarter over quarter. Also, the merger between Unimin and FMSA will create one of the largest logistical networks in the industry-(possibly larger than SLCA) which will be a huge headwind for smaller operators such as Hi-Crush.Hi-Crush ships most of its sand by rail from Wisconsin with only ONE mine in Texas.

thanks again for a detailed analysis. I have been noodling around but can't seem to come to a reasonable answer. they can produce 13.4m tons a year maybe about 3.35m per q so how much is long term contractual and how much is spot which as u know ceo said on the call is $20  higher than contract price so what is your best guess for the next 3 quarters for volume and pricing.

"Saint-Sauveur, thanks for this article.Could you provide a bit more color on how you derive your estimates of NAV per share? I see no figures or sources to back up your stance and estimates.This reminds me of the way a bunch of stock-promoting, sub-par amateur analysts were promoting the stock in France; they ended up losing over 90% of the money they put to work in the ""Sears Galaxy"", based on the exact same arguments. So did their clients who believed in those fairy tales (and they even paid 10k+ per year to get those fabulous ""investment advices"").On top of sources, I would love if you could clarify a few points:- Is SYW profitable? If not, how much sales could they possibly generate if they cut the distribution of points (it is easy to grow sales by selling $1 for $0.50)?- What percentage of the Innovel business is done outside of Sears stores? What is it worth outside of the failing ""Sears Galaxy""? I have not seen any new big client working with them for years despite it being called by some a crown jewel.- How much do you value the remaining real estate based on the Seritage transaction? The Seritage transaction gave real data points to help with this (and I think it broke the real estate bull thesis).- How much are Kenmore or DieHard worth, and more importantly how much of their sales are done outside of the Sears ""galaxy""? Assuming in the worst case that their sales within Sears fall close to 0, what do you think theses brands are worth?- Which companies would possibly be interested in getting Sears data, i.e. knowing that M. Doe bought a Kenmore washing machine 1 year ago and a lawn mower 1 month ago?

"Please address my points, pasted again below.  Ultimately, Sears is not working because the economics and associated numbers don't work.  Tell me how they can work:The reason for losses is straightforward: a severe decline in demand for the goods that Sears Holdings sells. To invert, ask what a realistic level of demand is, for what Sears sells, and then what level of revenue would reflect that. How many billion in revenue annually?As of the last annual report, Sears produced $4.7 billion of gross margin dollars. However, that was overwhelmed by $6.1 billion of SG&A expenses alone. In other words, demand has been dropping faster than Lampert can cut expenses.Demand, and thus revenue, would appear to be in secular decline. Currently, perhaps revenue is on track to come in at $15 billion? Gross margin rate of 20%? Then you have $3 billion of gross margin dollars. SG&A alone is running at around $1.2 billion quarterly.Fundamentally, Lampert needs to get those numbers to work. Otherwise every quarter that passes is going to produce a serious loss until liquidity runs out. Put differently, Lampert needs to get the quarterly SG&A figure to $700 million or so, to stay alive, and to keep cutting in line with a continued revenue decline.Either that happens, or cash runs out.",

"In another example as long as you can reduce overhead you can be profitable. This goes back a ways but Ames was profitable for a number of years in the 1990s running about 2.5 billion in sales on 450 stores, but they had ridiculously small overhead in store to compensate from the low foot traffic and ran few service departments (basically fabrics and electronics and the fabrics people often doubled into softlines).",
"ftnhead—The reason for losses is straightforward:  a severe decline in demand for the goods that Sears Holdings sells.  To invert, ask what a realistic level of demand is, for what Sears sells, and then what level of revenue would reflect that.  How many billion in revenue annually?As of the last annual report, Sears produced $4.7 billion of gross margin dollars.  However, that was overwhelmed by $6.1 billion of SG&A expenses alone.  In other words, demand has been dropping faster than Lampert can cut expenses. Demand, and thus revenue, would appear to be in secular decline.  Currently, perhaps revenue is on track to come in at $15 billion?  Gross margin rate of 20%?  Then you have $3 billion of gross margin dollars.  SG&A alone is running at around $1.2 billion quarterly. Fundamentally, Lampert needs to get those numbers to work.  Otherwise every quarter that passes is going to produce a serious loss until liquidity runs out.  Put differently, Lampert needs to get the quarterly SG&A figure to $700 million or so, to stay alive, and to keep cutting in line with a continued revenue decline. Either that happens, or cash runs out.",

"pe22 - wake up and smell the coffee.  It was about a year ago that Sears' own filings stated that ""the CEO's interests might no longer align with the shareholders"".  It is the shareholder's company that is paying millions a month in interest to - wait for it - Eddy!  It is Eddy who holds assets as collateral for those loans, which puts him above everybody else in a bankruptcy, not the shareholders.  He has not been keeping ""the ship afloat for this long"", as you say, to benefit the widows and orphans of Sears.  If you must credit him for keeping the ship afloat for so long, debit him also for creating a lot of widows and orphans in every neighborhood he has touched along the way.",

"Berkshire Hathaway is a great comparison to Sears because both were dying businesses. There's the slight difference where Buffett was able to use cash generated by the dying businesses and reinvest it into great businesses and grow book value at such a huge rate that the dying businesses quickly became insignificant to the company, whereas Sears is burning cash and Lampert is running the company into the ground, with no hope of escaping the immensely value-destructive retail business which is still crucial to every other part of the company. Other than that though, the similarities are uncanny.",
"Buffett and Munger were hungry for float in the early days (insurance, blue chip) as they understood it's value (non earning asset) and believed in their ability to compound the cash at attractive rates. Lampert has legacy long tailed insurance float and he's busy building out the rewards program float. As stated http://tinyurl.com/y7r...Sears had over 5 million mastercard account holders when the new rewards program was launched last year. This number has likely grown due to the 5321 incentive and a number of SYW members (not using the Sears mastercard) must have linked their other credit cards to SYW in order to take advantage of the 1% cash back in points when spending via the partnership network. The partnership network pays Sears a 1% cash rebate when members transact, which creates the float. This float is reduced as members use their points to make purchases via Sears. Obviously a certain amount of points will never be redeemed and as long the linked SYW member numbers increase, the float will increase.  The rewards float could become quite substantial over the coming years if you make some rough calculations on what people spend on their credit cards per annum, factor in the growing number of linked members and the growing partnership network.Float in the hands of talented stewards is extremely valuable as evidenced by Buffett and Munger.",

"Pretty good article saint. A couple points I'd like to make around the comments about Sears Re not growing because the company shrank. Totally irrelevant. Blue chip stamps business fell off a cliff and disappeared. It was the legacy float that was deployed to make a fortune. I defy anybody to tell me what the capital position of Sears Re is with any degree of certainty. Also, the reason you saw results faster in Berkshire was because they were bottom line results, not top line. It's much easier to shut down textile mills production and stop cash burn than it is to close down a nationwide retail network. The size of the revenue and losses to close that dwarf what could be very nicely profitable young businesses. You would never see it in consolidated financials.",

Shorts beware. $800M to fund SYW points in 2017 is pretty significant, but more importantly, it can be reduced (or increased) at will with a direct impact to the bottom line.Just realized that you can actually link ANY credit card to SYW and earn points on every purchase.

Sure a conservative SCOTUS doesn't agree.  NO surprise there.  For most of our history though  that was not the interpretation of the 2nd Amendment.

Delta should not have made a political decision to end it’s relationship with the NRA so close to the Florida shooting.  They will now be called on to to take a stand on every other controversy.  If they don’t advocates will claim not taking a position is taking a position.  If Delta thought there was a business case for not giving an NRA discount then it should have quietly not renewed it like they’ve done with every other group with which they sever ties.,
"Delta shouldn’t have taken a political stance based on “management views”.  Delta was virtually given a handout when they were in dire financial trouble.  It would be naive to think the 40M wasn’t already built in to their budget as the reinstatement has been an ongoing political debate for quite some time.  Delta is locked into a 20 year lease which includes a lot of revenues from airport vendors only if it remains their hub.  There are many airlines like Jet Blue that would love to have ATL as a hub.  The jobs from Delta would be created by other airlines coming to ATL.  I’ve always been a proponent of spreading the eggs into different baskets anyway.

"I think the big wildcard is Palantir, its largest position. They have steadfastly resisted going public up until now but apparently that sentiment is slowly changing. But as we saw with Spotify, there is a ready market for these premium private companies and a sale may net more than the public market will offer at times. (Just look at Twitter!) At any rate I think the sale last year of Spotify was at near the top end of their valuation and done as a risk control mechanism. Even after the sale it's the second largest position and 15% of assets. For all of ill conceived investments they've written off over the years, Spotify and Palantir are home runs,",

And of course do pro forma for Spotify 40:1 split that just occured last week.Yes, if the IPOs surge, then could definitely help GSVC NAV. However, at YRend 2017, their NAV = $9.64. I surmise they will be locked out of selling their Dropbox, given normal IPO. However, they may be able to sell their Spotify whenever they like, given its direct listing. This of course depends on whether their shares are limited to the same 1/3rd of total outstanding that are being offered and valued by the whims of the market. But that would only matter on the first day methinks. Haven't looked into it further.",
"Great research, thank you @gtoz. Interesting observation re sale of Spotify stock in Q4--  definitely a headscratcher. Where are you pulling the per share cost basis of the investments? I was unable to find them in the 10K. Also, I disagree on valuation being baked in. I'll gladly take the 33c from DBX but I think that will gap into the $25-30 range on Friday.

Thanks black cat,
"Very nice summary blackcat but you forgot to mention one thing. Whenever this gets to NAV or close to NAV on any run, management has always done a secondary at a large discount to market which crushes any rally. Although I am long this stock and have been stuck here for many years, I believe management are totally incompetent especially Michael Moe. The steps taken recently are positive but that doesn't solve the fact they have totally missed many emerging sectors namely autonomous cars, artificial intelligence, weed, blockchain, fintech.....",
I invested in them at $4/share because they're invested in some great start ups. I sold out around $6.50 after reading how about how terrible and selfish management is. I guess I should have stayed in until all the start ups they invested in IPO'd.,
"I've owned this patiently for years, but are you saying buy it now, sell at the post IPOs pops, or buy it and hold it? I had grown convinced it was a loser that would never pay me, and while seeing the NAV rise is a welcomed sight, how long will that last?",
"Wow, Spotify files F-1",
"Thanks for the great article. Just one comment on the high water mark of $12.55 for both stock price and NAV. The actual calculation suggests that it is much less demand that it looks like. The stock price is based on the volume-based stock price since inception. Since its higher prices and higher volume earlier on (around $20), the price watermark is probably already hit. The NAV calculation is adjusted for dividends and thus is satisfied now as well, that is, 9.69+2.8=12.49. Moreover, given the slow-moving nature of both metrics, the future change in stock price and NAV has limited impact. In other words, while the high-water market is a nice gesture, it doesn't create much incentive as it may first come across. Below is quoted from the SEC filing:"" Pursuant to this Waiver Agreement, in addition to the “hurdle” feature in the Incentive Fee described above, the Adviser hereby agrees to implement additional conditions on its ability to earn, and be paid, an Incentive Fee. As of the Effective Date, the Incentive Fee earned by the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement shall be payable to the Adviser only if, at the time that such Incentive Fee becomes payable under the Advisory Agreement, each of the Company’s common stock price and its last publicly reported net asset value per share is equal to or greater than $12.55 (the “Initial High-Water Mark”). The Initial High-Water Mark is based upon the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of all of the Company’s equity offerings since its initial public offering, less the dollar amount of all dividends paid by the Company since its inception. Upon such time as the Initial High-Water Mark is achieved, any Incentive Fee earned by the Adviser shall be due and payable by the Company as soon as practicable.""",

"LOL.  Yes, we have common ground looking 5 years out presuming we don't have $200 oil.  But in the meantime, you have macro fundamentals that are going to push oil up.  And in the secular view, that price is going to be higher than it has ever been.",
"We have found common ground:  Neither of us would buy and hold BPT.  I believe that is the single most important question facing BP investors.  People should listen to you on this; they won't, but they should.  I don't believe anything you or I say on this site influences the price at all.  Since I have a position (always short BPT) at most 10% of the time, I prefer the stock price to stay up the rest of the time.  Yet you will find I always take a bearish philosophy on BPT whether or not I have a position.  I don't believe my posts push the price down; I certainly hope not.  The next time I take a bearish position will probably be about ex div time.  That is based on real world events rather than SA articles and posts.By the way, I would not call myself a writer--one SA article in my life and not sure if I will bother with more. The money is in shorting BPT, not writing about it.",
"Guy, I'm not the one publishing errant articles, nor trying to convince people of anything.  I have no need or concern about credibility.  You however do have such a need because you are a writer.  The people reading don't have that burden.  You do.You can make money with BPT buying puts, buying calls, selling puts, selling calls, and especially using spreads.  I made very substantial gains on BPT spreads with 60/40 tax treatment. Would I hold for 5 years?  No.  Would I have panic sold last year when the short drums starting playing their game of buying puts and writing the most ridicules forecasts of near term doom?  No.",
"True, I can't demand your ideas.  It would however increase your credibility on the forum if you stated them clearly and stood behind them.  The ideas I requested are quite simple but can be reduced to two concepts.The first, which you have referred to repeatedly in general terms, is that the Saudis were going to drive up the price of oil through OPEC to enhance the ARAMCO IPO.  I believe they and the Russians have been pretty successful at this.  One year ago the WTI price relevant to BPT was $48.50 and tonight it is $62.15.  This is a very significant increase (28%) and should make the Saudis very happy.  You were right and congratulations to you!  However, this is a BPT site and the question we all should have is what this means for BPT.  At the current price the trust ends pay outs in Jan 2022 rather 2019 and is still a substantial loser in payouts vs share price decrease.Since you are this site's expert on Saudi Arabia and Aramco, the question for investors here is ""will the Saudis be willing and able to drive up the price of  oil enough to make BPT a winning investment?""  You have implied they would, but never stated they actually would.  What do you think?  My opinion, which is not as informed as yours, is that oil prices have stalled for the rest of the year.          The second question, which is appropriate for a BPT site on SA, is ""would you recommend this stock to a relative as a buy and hold investment for 5 years?""  I would definitely not.  But what do you think?         On options, I pursue simple strategies that are within my abilities.  I occasionally buy puts when BPT seems likely to go down. It has worked well for me.  Since there is a downward bias built into BPT, selective use of puts can be rewarding and has been.  The time value of the options is too costly  to use it as a steady strategy.  If one predicted that BPT would shut down in January 2022 and bought successive long term puts till then, one could be 100% correct and lose a lot of money at the same time.       I don't pretend to have a firm grasp of commodity cycles.  The great thing about being bearish on BPT is that almost all of the oil price scenarios have bad outcomes for BPT.  One doesn't have to be as clever as one needs to be to make money in say oil futures.  The odds are in my favor.  BPT is less than a zero sum game in the long run, and that is profitable to a bear.        I apologize if I offended you.  I wanted to get more clarity on your views and I don't think the questions are unreasonable although the tone may have been demanding.",
"No deflection. I have always said that if WTI  rises, then the termination date changes.  Current WTI means BPT stops payouts in Jan 2022.  Total payouts less than 14 dollars.  Still Not good for long term BPT investors. Do you have different calculations? If so, what?  The only salvation for BPT is a big rise in oil prices.Since you didn’t address ANY questions about your views, let’s repeat them:1) will the Saudis and the ARAMCO IPO push oil prices high enough to make BPT a winning 6 year investment?  What price will the Saudis reach for the IPO later this year? This question is central to the BPT bull thesis you have been pushing this last year. You must have at least a ballpark answer.2) do you own either BPT stock or long term calls? If not, why not? (I’ve explained here why I am not short now but probably will be in a few weeks; you can put your cards on the table too).3) would you recommend buying and holding BPT stock to a relative for the next three years? If so, why? If not, why not?Time to put up or shut up, my Lord Hamlake.  No evasions or misdirections.Disclosure (which you never make yourself): no position now, probable put options in a few weeks.  BPT up today.  I am hoping it hits $27.25 again around ex div time.  We we will see.",
"The end is based on the WTI.  The current WTI would indicate Jan 2022.  If oil rises, BPT’s demise will  be delayed.  If oil drops, the demise will be markedly accelerated.  Most WTI scenarios are very bad for BPT shareholders; do the math.  Would you recommend anyone buy and hold shares in BPT?  A sincere bull would.Shorting BPT is very expensive due to high time costs.  Selective shorting has been quite profitable for me.  But even though I believe BPT’s 5 year trajectory is to zero, the math says a short could easily be right and still lose money. So I have no position now but probably will in a few weeks.By the way, you have been touting the ARAMCO IPO as a driver in the oil price.  Do yo have a target WTI for December 2018 based on this theory? And do you own BPT stock or call options on it?  (Short term calls are likely to make money, longer term are not, IMO).  Thanks.",
"The Trustees are required to make their calculations of future cash flow and trust duration based on last year’s numbers rather than any estimates of future WTI.  The Saudis have succeeded in driving the price of oil up about $10 since then.  At the current price of $61.42, the Trust would end in Jan 2022 and total cash flow would be $13.53.  This would be a 30 per cent loss for current shareholders—not good. Note that this optimistically assumes 90,000 barrels per day production, which BP predicts will not happen.  Also, despite OPEC’s success in driving up oil prices, oil is 6 per cent off its recent peak suggesting that Saudi price fixing efforts have run out of steam.  Perhaps Lord Hamlake can give us guidance on oil prices over the next 12 months with the ARAMCO IPO. Summary:  the disastrous outlook in the BPT 10K should be upgraded to merely dismal.Disclosure: no position, despite my Lord Hamlake’s view that now is the time for shorts to pursue their wicked plans.  I may well establish a short position in about 3-4 weeks.",

Hopefully not. It doesn't matter what Apple does to competitors. It matters what they do for investors. If they convince Mr Market of future sustained growth the PE ratio will rise and if they don't it will fall.

Very interested.  Thanks so much for posting!,
"The trial for A. Schulman, Citadel opened this past week for anyone interested in the cvr..http://bit.ly/2qI6qrR",
I am assuming the cvr will not trade........,
"In order to fund the pursuit of claims and satisfy certain customer claims, Schulman will, simultaneously with the entry into the CVR Agreement, deposit into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) $15 million, subject to certain adjustments resulting from expenses incurred or litigation proceeds received between the execution date of the Merger Agreement and the execution date of the CVR Agreement. Neither LYB nor Schulman will have any additional funding obligations under the CVR Agreement other than making the deposit into the Escrow Account.A CVR committee will control the management and disposition of the litigation and related governmental investigations, including with respect to the prosecution, negotiation and settlement of claims. The committee will be comprised of one member representing the CVR holders, one member representing LYB and one independent member.Any proceeds received in respect of the litigation will be deposited into the Escrow Account. The first $38.5 million of litigation proceeds (less customer claims and expenses) will be paid to the CVR holders; thereafter, 85% of the remaining proceeds will be paid to the CVR holders and 15% to Schulman.",
"Directly from the article you reference which I gather is the source of your research:""A. Schulman is seeking rescission, damages, rescissory damages, disgorgement or any other remedy deemed proper for the alleged violations as well as seeking the costs and attorneys' fees for bringing suit.""",
"This article is poorly researched or perhaps written for self-serving purposes.SHLM is definitely not seeking $63mm- they are seeking rescission of the entire $800mm transaction.SHLM wrote down $200mm related to the transaction -- assuming the 85% after the 38.5, that equates to $176.20 -- with only 30mm shares outstanding that is $5.87 per share.There are only 30mm shares outstanding and the reason $38.5mm is the cut-off is because that is the amount sitting in escrow. Even assuming large legal fees, the CVR has $1 in cash/escrow value and if the full recission is granted -- then who knows what the value is.Two sellside firms have done deeper work on this.",Valuing A.

"Another fine piece, Bill, thank you.One minor quibble. While in any particular quarter the regulatory credit revenue is a ""one-off,"" in the bigger picture it is not.Revenue from ZEV, GHG, and CAFE credits totaled some $360 million in 2017. That's an average of $90 million a quarter. Given that Model 3 deliveries have been exclusively US so far (and concentrated in ZEV credit states), and given changes to the ZEV regime effective 1/1/18 that effectively boost the value for pure EVs while hurting hybrids, I will guess ZEV credit revenue of at least $500 million in 2018 is a safe bet.So, $125MM per quarter average, though the usual pattern of hoarding-then-strategi... will make the timing of the revenue lumpy.",

"Three weeks since your prediction of ""imminent"" breakout!  What happened Victor?  Actually you would have been far more accurate to predict imminent breakdown rather than breakout!  TSLA down 40 since Feb 27th! 180 degrees opposite direction!",
down 12% since this article published.  new ATH?  unlikely.,
"when the stock market crashed in 07 to 09, if we followed your logic, no one should have gone long any stocks since only the shorts can make money. In the end, TSLA will go bankrupt or get bought out for 100/share. The fundamentals will prevail in the end, hype doesn't last forever.",
"But we might see $300 prior to $350, which would be fine!",
"Hey Victor, I must apologize, I'm only joshing with ya!  I've been basically short TSLA on and off for a while now, but also play the long side on occasion.  TSLA is a great trading vehicle, with it's enormous short interest.  We shall indeed see what the future brings, I suggest that you load up here, we are going back to $350, baby!",
Victor really?   So the most important thing is you can get a car like the E class or 5 series for the price of S class or 7 series?   What a great deal.   Better buy 2.,
Outselling the Merc S Class and BMW 7 series is meaningless. The Model S' direct competitors are the E Class and 5 series. The Model 3 is competing with the C Class and 3 & 4 series. Merc and BMW are not going to sit back and let Tesla erode their profitable market share in the US or Europe,

"But your whole article says breakout imminent and fixing model 3 production is one of the pillars of that argument.Now you’re saying “doesn’t matter it’s fine in the long run.”Is it not a plausible argument to make that TSLA have no clue what they are doing in mass manufacturing?

"Victor sez: Since I wrote my ""Tesla is Likely to Rebound"" article, the stock has surged by roughly 20%.

"It is clear to me that the author is making some wild assumptions about future Tesla successes that are risky at best and are not based on good solid foundations. For example:- will the market for a $45K car even be affordable to the masses and generate mass market volume. I'm a middle market car buyer, but would never shell out $45K for a car. Couldn't afford it. - that Tesla will conquer cost efficient high speed assembly when it has shown no such skill today yet. It is certainly a risk to think they will make giant strides in manufacturing, quality and design to pull the cost down to where it makes a 25% gross margin. Might happen, might not happen. i.e. it's sure not a safe bet- while other ""disruptors"" sell for nosebleed Y2K style valuations at the top of a bull market, there is no assurance that will continue forever and history shows a STRONG likelihood that it will not. So even if Tesla conquers all its challenges and beats out much larger, more skilled, better financed auto giants, banking on extreme valuations is HIGHLY risky. For example, Google was once a disruptor too and now sells for <40x earnings at the very top of a historically overvalued market. This sets his work apart as being a cheerleader for gambling, rather than a sensible risk assessment and logical investment advice",
"Only reason TSLA will go up is because of short positions. It has nothing to do with fundamentals. There are so much short positions that the stock cannot go down and it affirms the beliefs that the longs has.1) model S and X are very good vehicles and TSLA is having a good business there. But their market is nothing compared with TSLA marketcap.2) model 3's main issue is not the factory issue. Its the percentage of people accepting model3's. It has become a 60000 dollar car (minus 10000 tax). The tax credits will go away. TSLA will make enough margin the 60,000 dollar cars. It will still not be a mass market car. I would be surprised if TSLA sells 200,000 model 3s. At least in the US the rebates are going away soon. So TSLA completely mislead consumers by advertising a 35000 dollar car. So Bolt and model3 are not in the same class.3) Challenges:A) Competition: They are coming. Suddenly Bolt seems to be a good bet (because of the price). Mistubishi Outlander plugin and Niro plugin are available. Crosstrek will have a plugin. A lot of auto driving companies are coming up. TSLA will probably need to buy out some of them.B) TSLA has to come up with a way of making a 30000-35000 car and still be profitable. TSLA cannot grow beyond 60B if they can only make cars that cost 60,000 or more.4) Numbers:BMW and TSLA has similar marketcap. BMW ships around 2000000 cars a year. TSLA S, X and model 3(with 50k+ price) will add upto 300,000 to 400,000 cars. Unless the profit margin is 3 or more times higher TSLA valuation will be exposed.I do not expect a change soon. But TSLA will surprise us with a profitability because of higher prices of model 3s. So if they were going sell 400000 model 3's with 3k profit, now they will sell 200000 model3s with 10k-15k profit. But thats a very short sighted upside. There are not many people waiting to buy a 50000 car.Model 3 owners will be surprised when TSLA really starts to sell cars at 40k or lower price.",
"Durgunuv has folowed others who have claimed that the demand for Model S and X are strong this year. They base that claim on the knowledge that wait times are longer for those models. But numbers don't lie : the fact is that sales of those models have absolutely cratered in Q1. They are WAY,WAY,WAY down, and the reason for the delays are because they have finally sold off at discount, all those Model S and Xs that had been laying around, and they transferred a lot of Model S and X workers to the Model 3 production line. They are producing very few Model S and Model X vehicles,mainly due to lack of buyer. A the current rate,I predict sales less than half (if that) of last year's.",

"Here we are ... more competition arrives next year ...Porsche's US dealers will offer fast charging stations for its Tesla-fighting Mission E sedanThe first all-electric Porsche is expected to look a lot like the Mission E Concept first shown in 2015. (Porsche)SAN FRANCISCO — Porsche plans to equip its 189 U.S. dealerships with 800-volt fast-charging stations in an effort to sell its forthcoming Tesla-fighter, the Mission E electric sedan.The German automaker already has six such EV stations at its Porsche Experience Center in Atlanta, home of its North American headquarters, and plans to add more soon at its sister center in Los Angeles. Both facilities allow Porsche owners to take delivery of new vehicles as well as experience them on a track.""Charging infrastructure is an extremely important part of the EV experience as a whole,"" Porsche Cars North America CEO Klaus Zellmer said in a blog post provided to USA TODAY that will appear on the company's website Thursday.Zellmer said fast charging stations will allow the company's four-door Mission E, due sometime in 2019, to add 250 miles to its range in around 20 minutes.Zellmer noted that for the majority of their charging needs, customers ultimately would have to rely on the nation's slowly growing network of charging stations, most of which will not charge a vehicle at an accelerated pace. ""You have to keep in mind that more than 80% of charging occurs at home,"" he said.It remains unlikely that Mission E owners would be able to charge for free at dealerships. Tesla initially offered free access to its highway-based Supercharger high-speed charging stations for its Model S sedan.Stefan Weckbach, head of battery electric vehicles at Porsche, said in the blog post that the company is exploring a range of fee structures for charging, including the possibility of flat-rate options depending on demand.Weckbach also confirmed that the Mission E will not resort to digital audio gimmicks in order to replicate the company's famous engine growl, and instead will encourage owners to embrace a new series of engineering-based sounds — from tire tread noise to suspension flexing — that will be audible due to a lack of internal combustion engine.The Mission E debuted as a concept a few years ago, and while its overall design has remained intact a few nifty features won't be retained. The futuristic cameras-as-side-view-m... will not make the production model due to a range of regulations in many of Porsche's key markets, including the U.S.But the sedan's ""suicide doors"" — rear doors from the back — are still shown as being part of the package in recent photos proffered by the company.Porsche plans to build the Mission E at the company's headquarters in Zuffenhausen, Germany, just outside of Stuttgart (some of its other models are built in factories in Leipzig, Germany). That decision means Porsche ""will need to recruit well over 1,000 new production and development employees,"" said Weckbach.The Volkwagen Group bought Porsche in 2012, adding it to a stable of brands that also includes Lamborghini, Bentley and Audi. Porsche executives say the Mission E will leverage the technological innovations developed across the VW Group while retaining a distinctive Porsche feel.A broad spectrum of automakers and technology companies are targeting self-driving cars in the coming years, specifically as part of ride-sharing services.The VW Group recently partnered with a new Silicon Valleystartup called Aurora, which is developing self-driving car hardware and software and is run by former Google car lead engineer Chris Urmson.But don't look for a self-driving Mission E. The company has no plans to automate the sporty sedan. Instead, it will add driver-assist features that can help in traffic situations.""Porsche drivers want to drive,"" said Weckbach, adding that ""no one believes that cars will be able to drive themselves completely in the short or medium term.""While a range of automakers are vowing to add many electric models to their line-ups, Porsche's sports car heritage makes its Mission E a true competitor to the Model S, which boasts a lofty price, wicked acceleration and an exclusive caché.Porsche's first all-electric model should be priced the same as the current Panamera sedan: $100,000, which is also about the cost of some upper-level Model S sedans. It will have a 400-mile range compared to the Tesla’s sedans 315 miles, and will hit a top speed of 155 mph, about the same as the Model S.Porsche cars have long been lauded for innovative gasoline engines, but now the company is doubling down on electrification.Beyond committing to the Mission E, Porsche also shocked the racing community last year by pulling out of France's 24 Hours of Le Mans, one of the world's most famous endurance races, which it had won repeatedly with hybrid-engine technology. Instead, the automaker plans to field a new race car in 2019 for the electric car series, Formula E.Follow USA TODAY technology writer Marco della Cavaon Twitter.",

I would like any short to give comment on  what's coming this year to include: Significant updates to both S/X driven by switch to 2170 and with it significantly better specs.These updated specs in high end models will make room for AWD M3 with industry leading specs that will leave the likes of BMW 3 series, Audi,  etc. in the dust. Lots of bear misconception as M3 is some kind of mass production Camry replacement. It's more entry/ mid level BMW, Audi, and MB killer.  Model 3 buzz in Tesla stores has actually brought in more demand for current S/X which is sure to increase when refreshes hit. Model 3 AWD with industry leading specs will continue that trend..There's hints out there but the bears are obviously looking the other way to suit their investment narrative. Hey no problem, there's an avalanche of such speculation and its at least as common behavior for shorts as longs. Lots of pot calling kettle black but lets just say it's all complacent analysts, media, institutional investors, tesla faithful, and only shorts having a clear understanding of financial principles.  Convenient! ....Very convenient....Will be plenty more Tesla buzz to come sure to mysteriously levitate stock price much to chagrin of bears.Wouldn't it be amazing if for once Tesla guided to the low end in S/X sales--how would that effect stock price?",

Over 80% of electric cars are leased and there remains no lease option for the Model 3.   This is a huge problem for Tesla.   Model 3 sales will collapse without a good lease option.,

"Its funny, I see Tesla in the process of falling if only looking at the technical.  Whenever the price challenges the previous overhead supply from Aug-Oct, the stock sells off with large volumes.  Its RSI is showing that its (at best) moving with the market, and not high like it was last year .   The volume on this latest move was ~20 million shares, but on a weekly basis this is lower than average telling me that there isn't as much interest to buy it as sell it.Lets see how distribution occurs at levels back from last year where people who got in simply want to get out.  Maybe there is still enough interest in the bull camp, but the price has suggested that this is questionable at best considering the price level is nearly the same from a year ago.  im not betting on ATH, and added a little to my short position.  But admittedly this one is a gamble",
"@Victor: Nice article.  I believe you are presenting a possible scenario for Tesla in your Reletively Strong Cash Position segment, but it appears to me to omit a few things.  1) Please share any insight into the how much of Tesla's available cash will need to be released very shortly to suppliers.  I believe mgmt did mention something on the earnings call about patient suppliers and needing to release funds for payment on equipment.  Note, the current Accounts Payable and Liabilities appear to wash the cash position.  2) Please comment on the amount of cash Tesla needs to release soon for the SuperCharger network and Service Centers to support customer needs.   I believe they are behind on their projections for SuperCharger stations.  I don't know if they had any stated plans for build-out of the Service Centers but I have seen comments that indicate that they would need to increase spending on Service Centers should they be able to produce 5000 cars per week.3) Tesla began build-out of the plant and equipment in Fremont and GF1 about 10 years ago.  What should investors anticipate regarding upgrade and replacement of manufacturing equipment?4) When will Tesla start to commit funds for Model Y, Roadster-2 and Semi-truck manufacturing plant and equipment and how does that figure into your analysis of Tesla's cash position?",

Glacial progress at best.- The S and X backlog are more likely a result of slower production due to layoffs and personnel shifting from S,X production to Model 3 production.- Tesla is not the first to market with a $35,000 200 mile range electric car. They are not yet producing such a vehicle- ""what we do know now is that Elon Musk and Tesla plan to take several comprehensive steps to drastically improve manufacturing productivity, and efficiency, to propel Tesla to the forefront of the manufacturing world. Tesla’s CEO recently stated that Tesla is developing the most advanced conveyor system in the world, that should allow the company’s Freemont facility to produce roughly 700,000 vehicles a year"" The inherent naivete and ignorance contained in this statement is staggering.To be at the forefront of the manufacturing world one must do better than taking 7 months to 'ramp up' to 13 jobs per hour  (1000/week) on the way to 125  jph (500k/yr). This places Tesla  at the very bottom of the manufacturing world. Pathetic Incompetence. I can hear the laughter coming from Toyota City where they are rolling on the floor laughing themselves silly.- The conveyor system is not a magic bullet to make the line go faster. Mr Musk's vamp on making a 30 mph conveyor in the last call was nothing more than mis-direction to avoid answering the specific production rate of the current line. A 30 mph conveyor would make moving line assembly a very entertaining site indeed and multiply the length of the line by miles. I cannot believe that anyone could take these comments seriously.",

Everyone who wants a gun already has one, and guns don't ware out very quickly  So now they have to continually come up with bigger, faster, higher capacity guns to sell to those who already have a gun.  If you look advertisements in gun magazines, they are not marketing to the average Joe.

Good article Mike. The facts clearly support that RDCM has plenty of upside for investors. RDCM management also continues to deliver on what it says it is doing.,
It's not unreasonable to take these deals and come up with approximately $75 million revenue run rate once ramped.   This does not include anything for new product.  At $75 million RDCM EPS should be in the ballpark of $1.25 to $1.65    This run rate should arrive in 2019.,

Are there other deals?And a Radcom question as well: Do you think that Radcom was part of a competitive bake-off with VodafoneZiggo and Vodafone? If not, why not? If the pricing is essentially the same for small customers as for big customers, wouldn't it be good to compete for the smaller fish as well?",

Btw if wmt sell online and customer picks up at store, does it count as an online sales or physical? similarly, if customer browse online then go to a wmt and buys it,it won't show a sales online, but physical.

Now they are back to Free Shipping at store prices, and you can easily check each item to confirm this. I will definitely start placing orders online again w/Free Shipping.

Seems that something this endemic would have disgruntled  wana bees falling over right and left to see their names all over the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.  In civil court the plaintiff has the right to subpoena of duces tecum. Failure to produce the records would be contempt of court.  All kind of records can be subpoenaed such as: records, email, transaction details, names, dates, commissions, overrides, money trails, you name it.Some legitimate argument that a served entity can argue for not producing records would be proving to the court that the records subpoenaed are irrelevant, are too general or are essentially an abuse of corporate privacy. Most judges would tell the respondent to produce the records or go to jail. Many times the judge will determine merit of the respondent's objection to produce the records. Usually the company being sued would request the records be sealed from the public. That's when everything gets murky and of course any case like this would go on forever, because many of the securities middlemen are international, the case would go international. There would be arguments about venue and it would go on and on like the Titanic song.I can see why the lawyers aren't lining up.Any way KC thanks for your brilliance, I'm delightfully surprised your essay this time is about a real life mystery.

This guy, Ray Kurzweil - http://bit.ly/1PT5Z6y - and others have articulated futuristic concepts that are beginning to become self-evident, outpacing the Moore's Law benchmarks faster than the investor community can uptake and utilize the related information in order to invest with knowledge and confidence. I believe AMD to be on the leading edge of understanding these developing applications and the underlying concepts. I think the investor should be asking, ""what companies have a vision trained beyond next quarter earnings?"" Those are the ones who will reap the IA harvests.Also for the Crypto watchers, I believe it will slow down, consolidate, and then resume apace as an evolutionary concept toward establishing as mainstream. If (if) crypto continues to be ""mined"", AMD will be on the front end of that provision as well. That said, I would not put too much emphasis on an AMD future state based on Crypto, or anything that is a work in progress.     > Long AMD avg 12.07 with conservative covered call writing, accumulating as available, as of 10:15 EST 3/1/18, AMD is 11.88",
"A statistical point below on AMD new hardware products and my latest experience as a buyer..  at the end, it is what personal users and companies buy all over the world..I have a Surface Pro, and several other AMD/Intel laptops, which have already a couple of years of use.I went this weekend to Best Buy and they only had one AMD new Ryzen 5/7 2000u series laptop model: an HP Envy x360 with the Ryzen 5 2500u, with a 1 TB harddisk and only 8 GB of RAM..  All the other machines were Intel with the obsoleted Intel integrated graphics, but fully loaded with SSDs and RAM memory..So my only option was to buy the HP Envy x360 Ryzen 2500u from Best Buy (I really wanted the Ryzen 7 2600u). I had to drive to Fry's and buy a 512 GB M.2 Samsung SSD, 16 GB RAM sodimm, 512 GB Samsung SSD, and it took me 20 minutes to install it on the HP Envy..  Cudos to HP on the design of the HP Envy x360, it was very easy to install the M.2 SSD, the 16 GB RAM, and the additional SSD..  It help to have watched some youtube videos of it and to have the right PC screwdriver and bits to use(very important).My AMD Ryzen 5 1500u HP Envy x360 now boots in just 6 seconds, from scratch, with the ultra-fast M.2 SSD.. and it just runs anything with total ease.. Even without all the additional hardware, the AMD Ryzen 5 ran smooth and fast..  I was running a training video in one Windows 10 desktop, my corporate main in another desktop, installing some new software on another, and it was running like if there was nothing running on the system.My Intel Surface Pro and my other machines are not being used since this 15"" AMD HP Envy is just a pleasure to work with.. Comes with face recognition login, great Bang&Olufsen speakers, etc..I can say that the latest AMD Ryzen products are top of the line.. even if HP, Dell, and maybe others do not like to equip the AMD machines with high-end components..AMD with their Raven Ridge Vega APUs totally make all Intel gpu integrated solutions obsoleted and AMD pricing can't be beat.. $690.00 for the 15"" AMD Ryzen 5 2500u HP Envy x360 machine..  must less than the other Intel models and much better gpu performance, which is key since gpus run all the OS graphics, applications graphics, presentations, corporate graphical applications, etc..I am seeing more and more companies get AMD hardware products too..  AMD is the only company that has a double socket EPYC board with 4 TB of RAM capabilities, or 3 TB RAM capability with one socket and with 64 or 32 cores, more big data companies are just beginning to change to AMD server/cloud hardware.. Sometimes 8 times less expensive than Intel solutions.. that is a huge savings for any small or large company..I can just say from own experience and from my corporate experience, AMD is coming back strong and has excellent products.. not only cpu products, but gpu, and apu products, and for work.. epyc, threadripper, and other world class one products..I can read lots of articles, but what I see from my corporate view and on the personal  technological landscape view, AMD will be one of the best contenders within 2 years and maybe it will cycle to the top. We will see how AMD ramps the profits in all of its cpu, gpu, apu, and infinity fabric derived products in the corporate and personal areas..",

Amazing article Dr. Kwen,
"On a big NSDQ up day, the same garbage again - AMD can't even hold its close of 12.53 yesterday, yet alone yesterday's high of 12.88.Kwan-Chen's comments are so on target.  The article is based on Short-Selling, but even with Kwan's tedious mining of short data on both a daily and a per-lot basis, he does not see a way of how to use this data for the purpose of determining the pattern, the modus operandi, of the shorts.This is extremely frustrating, as this stock cannot get any real traction, and I believe it will remain in this position indefinitely, until an absolutely blow-out quarter, with sales that are huge of the newest chips, actually happens.  Any thoughts?",

Is it just me or is there much less negative/short commentary on AMD articles than about a year ago?  Bullish sign?,
Do you believe based on your analysis that the pattern and extent of AMD short sales in the past year is disproportionate to that of other stocks in general (and to what extent)?,

"Nice article author.  Too extrapolate your information if I buy AMD stock 2 weeks before ER and then sell position at end of trading day of the ER, I should make on average ~250% on my money over the course of a few years.  And people wonder why the shorts are all over AMD!  It is a very good game when it repeats over and over.  The problem is when AMD actually makes a break out move and all those short positions loose all they made and then some.  Some of the greatest profits made in stocks is realized when shorts get squeezed!  AMD will continue to be popular until a few of the short sellers go BK due to greed!  BTW a short squeeze is when the shorts actually start to drive up the price of the stock because the due date is upon them and the stock never went down!",

"I think AMD is destroying short sellers this year so far. Even after the market sell-off. Shorts are down 10% since the start of 2018. Shorts have been trying, but they are not keeping it down.",

"""The use of short sale volume is particular valuable in terms of gathering investors' intent.""Shorts..?  It sounds more like stock manipulation, which Jim Cramer already has called for an investigation on the AMD stock..Intel used to pay AMD customers so that they will not buy AMD products.. It gave Intel time to recover and to damage AMD profits at the same time, but it was sued by AMD and Intel had to sign an agreement and paid AMD several billion dollars to settle here in the US.. In Europe, the courts will decide on Intel unethical practices on 2018..The curious similarity, is that it seems like some big colluding investment entities (Goldman Sachs, Barclays, etc.) etc, investment news sources (CNBC), corrupted analysts, etc..  are colluding with Intel to put down AMD by selling AMD stock in negatively impacting patterns to keep AMD stock down (selling at the start trading day, at the end, giving fake poor analyst reviews, etc..) and selling after AMD has any good good news or after Lisa Su talks, etc).. it is very obvious that there is a big colluding effort to keep AMD stock down.. If so, Intel would have broke its court agreement on not using unethical practices to ding AMD profits.. Intel is known to use exactly these unethical practices, so it is not like how can you accuse Intel of potentially manipulation the technology market..AMD should look into this, and there has been already lots of filed complaints to the feds already.. I am wondering when are the feds going to do something about this.. Even Jim Cramer has noticed the manipulation patterns and openly called for an investigation on AMD stock and news manipulation going ton..No matter what.. AMD has released, will continue to release, such a barrage of products, that Intel (or any other entity) will not be able to manipulate the amounts of profits AMD will be bringing from their CPUs, GPUs, APUs, Infinity Fabric, etc..   in servers, cloud, laptops, personal and professional workstations, artificial intelligence, VR, AR, embedded, gaming consoles, etc.. Intel is just a CPU company and will not be able to hold AMD from getting market share.. just AMD getting its proper market share in its 60 billion cpu, gpu, apu TAM, will make AMD grow potentially even bigger than Intel..  Even more, where AMD enters the x86-64 high-end smartphone and tablet business with their 7 nm high-end APUs.. AMD has already integrated Qualcomm's LTE modem and VR wireless technology (from a company it bought) into its incoming chips.",

"Thank you for the excellent SHORT article and great to know the SP movement is more revenue based rather than other fundamental information. AMD still belongs to a largest short volume club in Wall street, ranked #2, as of two weeks ago which probably didn’t change today. Observing many stocks including AMD, I've seen many unusual call buying activity prior to ER, so this may be related to short selling to protect a short position with call options. It makes perfect sense higher volume for Out of Money calls may be proportional to increase in short volume. This activity may give false hope for longs and it is not necessarily a long call activity.http://on.wsj.com/2zigeve",
"If AWD can really capture server market share ahead of schedule, with the much increased revenue and profit, shorting AMD will become much more riskier.

"Dr. Kwan,thanks for you study. The most important data I am looking for is near the 3rd qtr earnings. 1st qtr earnings the expectations were just too high as new products were not available2nd qtr earnings downfall was because of Mubadala taking some profit off the table after holding AMD stocks for a long time4th Qtr earnings downfall was mostly because of general market going down because of volatility products and employment data.Third Qtr earnings is special. It was very good but forward guidance was same as last year. So it was a overreation for no fundamental reason but was from uninformed short traders. Also the stock price remained lower and it has taken a long time to recover from that meltdown. Can you provide some summary statistics of the data during that period and some analysis",
"Good analysis but you are forgetting the most important piece of the short puzzle which is the amount of outstanding AMD calls that have been sold surrounding each ER event as this is the primary reason why the shorts increase their shorting anytime AMD ever moves up in price.  They are not shorting any perceived overvaluation as you characterize it but instead they are shorting to prevent massive losses on their sold calls so they increase their shorting anytime AMD moves higher.  This is also why there is large Pre ER and post ER shorting because the shorters are also the ones who have sold large amounts of calls into the market so they are merely using their large post ER short volume to make the first option expiry after each ER expire fully out of the money which has been very successful throughout all of 2017 in maximizing their profits.Then, after this initial option expiry has completed they close out much of the new shorts that were used to crush the share price post ER which is why you are seeing a squeeze type effect the following week.",

Benefits of the doubts on PGH welcome at last.,
There's some calculation issues with the pricing of the oil. It's heavy oil so on top of the WCS spread you have to drop $5-10 vs WTI due to quality. It's still worth more than $.75 that's for sure. At least 3x. We need to see the next quarterly earnings.,

"By Tiernan Ray(Barron)Micron Technology ( MU) is poised to go from being a ""follower"" in terms of low-cost production of NAND flash to being a ""leader,"" according to a report this afternoon from Susquehanna's Mehdi Hosseini.Hosseini, who has a ""Positive"" rating on Micron shares, and a $60 price target, writes that his ""checks"" tell him the company is going to introduce new solid-state drives in the latter half of this year that will make use of flash of the "" QLC"" variety. Those drives will reduce costs of the drives further, giving the company an edge against competitors -- presumably Western Digital ( WDC), for example.""We remind investors this would presumably make MU the first major storage vendor to bring QLC-based SSDs to market,"" writes Hosseini.The new parts will ""help change the MU narrative from a follower to one that leads in lowest NAND bit cost,"" he argues. ""Cost leadership can also enable MU to become aggressive on market share gains without sacrificing margins.""In addition to using the QLC approach, Hosseini believes this will be the first drive Micron uses its own ""controller"" chip. The part, design and built by Micron, as opposed to one that had been bought from Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL), ""provides for a lower BOM while amplifying cost improvements stemming from the fact that QLC NAND provides nominal density increases of 33% (vs. TLC).""Note that Micron will report quarterly results on March 22nd, after market close.Micron stock today closed up 23 cents at $53.97.",

Please stop this nonsense on $100 share price this year. We just broke through $50....1st owned MU in 1990's and it skyrocketed and then fell to earth fast. We went from pull back (high 30's) not very long ago and where we sit today is still a big fast run up. Perhaps some Nvidia folks and others are shifting over to MU story. I'll take some bets on any $100/sh this year being obtained (and MU is my largest holding).Trying to stay a bit grounded to market fickleness and reality on these good up days like today...,
So finally MU is getting recognition on CNBC halftime report Cramer and Co. giving two thumbs up. For what it’s worth I have a technical analysis of a flag intermediate term term bullish 13 weeks starting 2/23 with a price target of $78-$85 that would be May June!   Still black magic.,

"Here’s How Trump Could Really Hurt China on Trade Bloomberg NewsMarch 1, 2018, 11:30 PM EST Updated on March 2, 2018, 1:39 AM EST    Machinery, electronics are almost half of U.S.’s China imports    Steel, aluminum tariffs won’t cut U.S. deficit, analyst says U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs won’t cause China too much pain. If he really wants to land a blow on the biggest trading nation, he’d need to target electronics, toys and textiles.Metals were just 5.1 percent of American imports from China in 2016, World Bank data show, while machinery and electronics made up 48 percent. Miscellaneous items like furniture and toys accounted for 16.5 percent of imports. Textiles and clothes made up 8.6 percent.The data show Trump is attacking the wrong imports if he wants to cut the huge trade deficit with China, and that doing so would require measures against higher value products. Problem is, tariffs on goods such as electronics would ripple across a vast global supply chain, hurting U.S. allies from Japan to South Korea and Taiwan.“If Trump really wants to hit China’s exports to the U.S., he’ll have to move beyond small fry steel and solar panels to big ticket items such as electronics and telecom products,” said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. “Any serious attempt to bring down the U.S. trade deficit with China will need to focus on the big categories.”continues: https://bloom.bg/2tcAGyNThis is why electronics/semiconductor companies are selling off in response to these threatened tariffs.",

"My personal view is market could have looked beyond. The dram market is expected to see an oversupply in 2019, which means price drop would be inevitable and therefore erode suppliers' top-line and margin. That is, mu's EPS in 2019 will be very likely much lower than US$10 you projected for 2018...Besides, p/e multiple could be blind because it looks so low when the stock is at an upward cycle. However, when we look forward, Eps comes to let's say US$5 for instance next year, it means current share price of around 50 or 10x P/E would not be that cheap...BTW, this is an analyst from DRAMexchange. Thanks for quoting our comments.

"To Joe: Congratulations on an outstanding “series” of articles specifying trading strategies and technical analysis of why and when to buy/sell MU shares. I have held a core position in MU since the Stock was at $32, but I have thoroughly enjoyed reading your takes (opinions) on the stock from $40 to $50, back down to $40, and now back up on the way to $50 again. Your thoughts helped me to trade (time) multiple buys/sells over the last 4 months as well as encouraged me to hold onto my core position.It has been very challenging being an MU Shareholder, BUT, I can honestly say that the last 4 months have been a lot of FUN for me. Plenty of Ups and Downs and this whole thing has been more like playing Chess (thinking multiple moves down the board) in this game folks call investing. Everybody likes to make money, but I can honestly say I will probably never spend a dime of what I have made (my children will probably have that honor), but I sure have had a lot of Fun making it. Thanks again for an outstanding series of Articles on MU. You and Damon Verial are my favorite Authors on Seeking Alpha and both of you have helped folks to make a lot of money if they would keep an Open Mind To Technical and Statistical Analysis. I try to take what you fellows offer up and blend it with a little of my own Fundamental, shake (not stirred), and serve it up in a chilled environment (I try not to employ any emotion in loving or hating a stock). But Once Again, MU has been quite challenging and I have probably had more FUN with MU than any other stock I have owned in the past 40 years (and I have owned literally hundreds). I made most of my money in Tobacco (MO/PM) and then again in Oil (COP), and Tech (AAPL), but MU has been my favorite in Retirement.I will look forward to your next Article and I expect MU Longs will be celebrating come the end of March. The Question is (and enquiring minds want to know) will MU stay above $50? Or will it drop back on a Euphoric sell off? The only folks who really care are the ones with skin in the game and stay engaged in the proposition. I am still “holding”, BUT I have my finger on the trigger everyday.   :)Wishing The Author Well And Also To All MU Shareholders!",
"Interesting conference call by Enphase (they make inverters for the solar power industry).  Apparently their gross margins are being squeezed because of a shortage of components which includes memory (no idea what kind of memory is used in a smart power inverter):""So let me give you some color on the components shortages, I'll give you a little bit of history as well. We experienced significant component shortages throughout 2017. These components shortages were mainly on high voltage FETs and on memory. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by 1% to 2% due to expedite fees in Q3 2017 and Q4 2017.In Q1 2018 we see continued pressure on the same components. In fact, we think this component shortage will persist throughout 2018 and even into early 2019.""",

"Joe Albano, I think regarding a return to shareholder via a small dividend is in no way the sign that they cannot employ capital at an higher yield!

My views are very similar to your’s except I think the market will be forced to pay a higher multiple very soon, provided the memory demand stays strong for remainder of 2018 (highly likely). There is a fundamental shift happening in the way devices operate these days making them memory dependent and that augurs well for MU. I believe the multiple will move to 7/8x very soon and that would peg MU close to $70.",

Can anyone shed some light on rumors that PPL will be bought out by Talen Energy? Something's got to be brewing for this stock to be dropping so hard....?,
"Thoughts now that PPL's price has crossed the 52wk low and surpassed 5.75% dividend yield? I bought some shares at $33.9, $31.96, and $29.75. I'm not against buying down, but how much lower does it have to go? I don't want to continue trying to catch a falling knife or keep buy into a value trap.",
"Also dividends will have to be paid on those one billion new shares issued, putting further pressure on payout ratio",
The dollar became stronger a few days ago too!,
Most likely the underperformance has more to do with the caps on energy prices the government in the U.K. is proposing on regulated utilities.  Take a look at Centrica (largest in the U.K) and SSE (another large utility) and one will see similar outsized losses in the share price.,

"I get that income investors tend to seek ""safe"" investments as rates rise but, pardon me if I don't consider federal debt much safer than a profitable utility currently paying 5.5% that's also raised its payout steadily for the past 17 years.  Uncle Sam is adrift in an ocean of red ink, uses borrowed money plus your own income taxes to pay you the interest on the money you loan him, then makes you pay income tax on that interest.  He paid over $400 billion in interest on the debt last year, and apparently has decided that he can afford to both take on additional debt and pay out a lot more in interest by raising rates.  Smart investment?  If you say so.  Yeah, PPL is facing some challenges but has posted only three quarters of negative earnings in the past 10 years, has rate protection in the UK for roughly the next 5 years, has laid out a clear and achievable plan to grow earnings and the payout over the next four years, and is trading around a 30-month low.  I think PPL's worth the risk.  DISCLOSURE:  I am long PPL.",

"While most of the comments are pointing to the Jaguar I-Pace, I think that the downfall of Tesla will be the Hyundai Kona.Why?- Acceptable price for a lot of people.- Tax incentives are available.- I looks quite nice.- Range will be enough for most buyers.- It is a crossover, which are selling like crazy at the moment, also in Europe.- I am sure that a leasing options will be available.- Built quality will be high.- Insurance quotes will be attractive.Just my two cents.",
"They have many obstacles to overcome.  Production and debt are for starters.  I'll stick with the major car makers who may crush them in a matter of time and get paid while waiting with dividends and in GM's case, cap gains.Always after the fact - -  should have bought more !",
"Anton makes his own predictions about Model S and X refresh and when Tesla will not reveal on his predicted timelines, Anton will write the following article: ""Tesla is late in delivering updated model, consensus was early March"".",
"The other thing we will find out in the next 90 days (likely, anyway) is how long do the Federal tax incentives run.  Does Tesla cross the sales threshold in Q2? Or Q3?Although they can produce unlimited with the incentives for two quarters after that, those two unlimited production period will likely see last minute buyers show up with conditional buys (from overstock, whatever), perhaps accompanied by the bear case shifting to what happens when the unlimited period ends and the tax incentives are reduced.",
Anton very informative. Thank you! Keep up more good work please.,
"Recently contributor Donn Bailey posted his informed belief that the Tesla semi truck would be built, if anyplace, at the kilofactory near Sparks, Nevada.  Only 40 per cent of it is now occupied by the Panasonic battery plant, he said.  (I beg Mr. Bailey's pardon for any misquote.)I have no insight of my own into this, but last year an engineer at the battery plant (so claimed) code-named ""endeep,"" in a series of fascinating posts at disqus, pointed out many problems at his workplace.  There is only one access road from Interstate 80 to the kilofactory.  That stretch of freeway is often slowed or closed from weather and accidents.  Power failures are frequent from the local generating plant.  (Why a factory cannot run on solar power could be for the same reason as a battle tank, warship, or jet fighter.)  Keeping dust out of a factory located in Nevada is a particular challenge.  (Who would of thunk?)  Not least, the local workforce is largely incompetent, being bred in a culture of entertainment rather than manufacturing.  I am neither shong nor loort on Tesla so it's all academic to me.  But interesting!",
There is nothing to depress sales better than creating rumor of refresh. Of course Tesla announced no refresh of S and X this year.  That really should not prevent a true Tesla short to create an entire article centering around that.,
"Author probably trying to get people to not make a purchase in fear of an imminent refresh. I think their primary goal is to get M3 ramped up. It would be foolish to divert any effort to S/X,  that enjoy a backlog already into summer.",

"$35K Model 3 at 5K a week production run, all commencing April 1st.",
"It astounds me that in one sentence Tesla's massive 24+ billion dollar debt can be considered, and in the next sentence people are speculating whether or not they can consistently build 1000 cars per week - and you have to speculate because Tesla keeps this information as a closely guarded secret. The reality is that even if Tesla was building 5000 cars a week (and as Tesla has stated themselves this is the MAXIMUM capacity for this assembly line), and even if they were able to build and sell these vehicles at a respectable profit margin, they would still not earn enough profit to service just the interest on their staggering debt. Some people have also argued that a $50k model 3 is better since they would generate more profit per vehicle, completely ignoring the fact that the higher the price, the smaller the potential market. And lastly, people purchase Tesla vehicles for a whole range of reasons and motivations. Just because Tesla's are BEV's doesn't mean potential buyers don't cross shop ICE vehicles. The stock will remain high, volatile and speculative. But the ever mounting debt will eventually crush the company. People who defend Tesla insert the word ""shorts"" as many times as possible into a post because they have no rational argument other than to point to the fact that the stock went up, completely ignoring the disastrous financial fundamentals. The only chance the company has is to BK and escape their crushing debt. And then all you're left with is an unprofitable enterprise.",
good breakdown of what is to come in the next 3 months. I really do not believe a refresh of the model X/S is not going to help with sales especially when you have more and more EV cars hitting the market that are way cheaper and in the price range of the average car buyer.,
"Thanks for your INFORMED article Mr. Wahlman. The dyllusional nonsense I read on these pages from the Bull camp just blows my mind....insanity. At this point the share price is SO detached from any fundamental metric that it simply cannot be traded by ANY ""investor""....it's a pure gambling play either way! For this reason I am short with long puts because the ONLY metric....or set of metrics that will re-align the share price will be the macro narratives, (interest rates/inflation/consum... and effects of competition from other manufacturers.WHEN the narrative changes it will be sudden, 'unexpected' and total. Think Roulette ball landing on zero. While this company MAY avoid full on BK there is NO way on earth it can avoid being ultimately being valued with it's peers. Its peers are NOT Apple, Amazon, Facebook etc. They are Daimler Benz, BMW, Audi, GM, Jaguar Land Rover etc...ignore these real car producers at your peril as a long because they KNOW how to make cars and trucks.",
"I parked next to a bolt the other day.  It is actually laughable.  I don’t understand.  Except I do understand.  Big auto cannot make a competitive EV.   Because they would be hurting themselves.   ICE is their priority because they are locked into ICE infrastructure.   To make a comparison, think landline phone.   ICE=Landline phone.  After watching a Sopranos rerun the other day, I was surprised to be reminded that the landline phone was everywhere only a few years ago.",
All the talk about the competition while more Model 3s are being delivered. The iPace will flop and I predict will be discontinued within one year with no dealers incentive to sell them (no service revenue) and no places to charge them. Tesla owns the high and middle EV market and importantly the long range EV market for years to come. The only place for competition right now is the low market segment with short range EVs. Daimler already admitted that they are not able to replicate the Tesla specs.,
S/X refresh? Where do the get the money? How about fix model 3 horrible quality issue?,
"""""Or will the company fall short yet again?""""  It is very clear that the company and the head ring leader of this circus, Elon Musk is full of hot air, empty promises, a beautiful car, unliminted debit and no clue how to make profits from selling a car so you distract everyone by saying you will produce a truck even though you can not produce a car, you will produce a semi truck even though the technology does not esist yet and you can not produce a car, and you can put a car in space but you can not produce a car and you have a price tag of 35,000 on a car you can not produce for that price or for a profit.  And the stock continues to go up because......I can not figure out how this stock continues to go up.  My only theory is the fact that institutions have bought into the game and are running the stock up as they have done with the entire market.  Retail investors do not have a chance to invest on fundamentals when the institutions and hedge funds have created a casino controled by the crooked house.",

Obviously, the shorts don't have a clue why this is happening.  Here's a clue, shorts are focusing on the wrong things and missing the big picture.",
"There is no way Tesla can achieve positive EPS carrying the full weight of the Supercharger Network, Dealership Network/Service, warranty expense, lease value expense, solar city debt and launch a new 100k product. We all know Model 3 will not hit 100k units this year. Tesla to hit 300k unit sales will require another model now that competition is here. At the pace they are on carrying this infrastructure expense it will be 50 billion dollars of debt. They are structurally bankrupt. The only way out to me is selling a Tesla crypto currency to the fan boys and monetizing the debt that way.",
"Does Jaguar have a charging network?At this point if you were to buy an electric car, would you buy a Tesla or a Jaguar?",
"Tesla bulls keep saying that Tesla cars are superior to everything out there..........and they were right, up til now. The existing auto giants have done a great job allowing Tesla to lose a fortune, developing a brand new market for them and thus delaying their own entries until they could be profitable doing it. It's not that big auto COULDN'T produce good EV's, it was that they did not want to produce good EV's yet because there wasn't a market. Now they will rapidly catch up aided by their massive cash flows, slick organizations and impressive manufacturing and supply chain skills, none of which Tesla has. Tesla cannot win this fight; too many competitors, too much capital being mobilized against them. And Tesla is weak at everything anyway",

Just a long hard slog but I am still a believer. - BARDA can terminate ""for convenience at any time."" That doesn't sound very comforting, esp. in the age of Trump. - Not sure I fully understand the mechanism for the anti-takeover provisions. Obviously, they need some protection as the stock is significantly undervalued. I don't like hyperbole but I do think this could be a 10-bagger if you are patient.",

"Thanks for the article on this intriguing company Steven.  I almost started a position a few years ago but never did, and it fell off my radar.  Looks like now may be the time and definitely worthy of further review.  Regarding the need for additional cash to compete; while the current cash position is solid, I would anticipate the need for additional capital down the road but at a higher valuation.  The recent offering was only a small part of a $250M mixed shelf filed a few months ago.  WRT the patent issue; do you know the name of the third party that owns the competing patent?",
"Superb article. Wow! I was under the impression that the ARC had filed for its BLA a year ago and a decision from the FDA was imminent.  I was also under the impression that one FDA decision covered all ARC centers. This would be the fourth and, by far, the largest approval. Your information sounds much more specific and credible than mine. Does it come from Cerus or from the AMerican Red Cross?When estimating revenues, we should be careful when comparing Q4'16 to Q4'17. Sales to France in 2016 were substantially lower than in 2015 due to French reticence in renewing smaller orders ahead of their larger deal with Cerus in 2017. In addition to that Q4'16 artifact, 2017 might show unsustainable relative increases if revenues where driven by a catch-up of those delayed French orders and one time illuminator sales.I follow this company as closely as I follow any. Your evaluation of the patent situation and takeover protections gave me new insights. Thank you.",

But I owned a lot more SDRL, figured that holding and hoping common would keep that precious 1.9% of the new company was worth the risk - can't sit here and say I'll eventually recover any significant part of my investment, but should the deal be approved maybe in 10 yrs the position will be worth a lot more than it is now. Note this is only for people who were dumb enough (like moi) to ride SDRL all the way down - I absolutely would not be a buyer before BK is over, and would not be buying any until offshore drilling is in full recovery, and god knows how long that will take - the entire sector is off limits to new investment from my POV.",

"Vladimir -thanks for the insightful article. I agree SDRL is way over priced, but I don't ecpect SDRL will ever trade at its real value while in Ch.11. When it starts trading, the new Seadrill stock price will not be a poaitive for current SDRL holders.I talked to a few guys in the BK industry and they thought that the tiny equity recovery was kept to keep current shareholders ""interested"" in Seadrill equity post-BK. Overr the years, I almost always asserted that shareholders should get a token amount of new equity  because it could add liquidity to the new stock- broader shareholder ownership.It seems like BK Judge David Jones is just 'rubber-stamping"" this inspite of a few BK legal issues as longs as most of the stakeholders agree to it. If some minor stakeholder tries to make trouble there could be problem, but as of now many are assuming that the amended plan is a 'done deal'.",

Because I am a VERY conservative investor I have only allowed myself to allocate about 10% of my portfolio to the 5 gene editing stocks- EDIT, NTLA, CRSP, SGMO, CLLS.  This has more than doubled in less than a year but there's more to come.  I am pretty sure in 5-10 years I will be kicking myself for having been so conservative...I really hope these companies don't sell out cheap - accepting a 50% premium would be a really stupid move.

There is additional technology -- interesting technology like switching gene editing. We certainly like to build a whole blanket and play market leader in cell therapy.” http://bit.ly/2t1pg0v",
"Daniel-Great idea for a podcast but wish you or Mike had a little more knowledge of the subject matter.  So much was missed that it felt like a superficial conversation.  A few points to consider:1) There are four primary Gene Editing companies not three, though CRISPR Therapeutics has stated that there are really 5 since they spun on Caseba with Bayer.  The leader in editing was completely ignored:  SGMO.2) The discussion of partnerships, while true on the funding side, would have been much more insightful had the topic of therapy (molecular biology) vs delivery (molecular engineering) been addressed.  In simple terms, editing is molecular engineering (the technical approach to delivery the therapeutic to the correct genomic target and ensuring their are no side effects (toxicity, off-targets, replication, etc) from the process.  The therapy is the molecular biology involved to create the therapeutic being delivered.  The partnership between CRSP and Bayer which formed Caseba is a great example.  CRSP contributed the molecular engineering and Bayer the funding and molecular biology to create therapies of the future.  Much can be learned by watching the collaborations bringing the two parts of the future therapy together.3) The CRSP treatment in EU for AML was eye-opening for many in the space.  Using Cas9 to edit 2 children on a hardship exemption preclinic resulted in one cure and one remission.  The potential for editing is now perceived to be less potential and more timing.  CRSPR editing approaches have come under fire however because of off-targeting concerns and human immunity.  These have not been linked to the zinc fingers editing approach used by SGMO.4) The increased ownership by Bayer was one of the drivers of their stock rally.  With Celgene selling shares, this was an endorsement of sorts as their closest partner buying was a validation to the market. However it was also a larger roadblock for any other potential acquirer such as Gilead which really should have been mentioned in the podcast.  5) The biggest omission ties back to SGMO. Sangamo is the only gene editing company in the clinic with in vivo editing.  They have also shown superior multiplex cell therapy and gene regulation for both allogeneic and autologous approaches.  Note: the autologous approach is what drove the GILD acquisition of Kite.  Gildead just signed a collaboration with Sangamo to combine their edting delivey with Kite molecular biology for oncology.  The commentary from GILD on their collaboration conference call suggested that they spent 6 months evaluation and testing the engineering alternatives and felt that zinc fingers was best in class.  The odds of GILD now buying CRSP after this announcement are significantly reduced.  The collaboration is for oncology only which fits the Kite acquisition profile.  I hope you do more of these podcasts but with a little more meat. Mike sounded very informed generally but said early on that he knew little about the Kite science and editing in general.",

"Interesting take. I'm sure it's a mix of all-of-the above. Alibaba is only as strong as the Chinese economy and its government patronage. It's one of the companies chosen to succeed by Xi and his close circle. That's a double-edged sword in that it will inevitably be used as a piggy bank to save pet projects/companies of the elite (despite their profitability). We're already beginning to see it be used as the good company in the breakup/deleveraging exercise for debt-laden conglomerates like Wanda. It's only a matter of time for the piggy bank to be cracked open (the Minsky moment is coming).Personally, my biggest concern with Alibaba is its opaque corporate governance structure. It incentivizes bad behavior. We've seen seen only a small sliver of what can and will be done.I've held Yahoo/Altaba for 20 years, through it's ups and downs. I recently sold most of my position to lock in profits.",

Starting to look good to me.,
"@Author - although I agree with your bottom-line conclusion that TEVA could trade up to $40 within 3 years -- short-term, I think we're likely to see < $15.   I remain sidelined for a while.The near-term headwinds are:1. Most job-cuts are still to be made, and in order to do so, CEO has to be telling us ""the sky is falling; job-cuts are mandatory""... and as a result, the CEO will behave like a passive bear on the stock price.   His #1 job is to succeed at job cuts; which is best facilitated by a doomsday narrative.   This will drag on stock price in the days to come.2. The last ER impairment of -$11B more, just took TEVA EPS from -$6 to -$17, and PE from -3 to -1.1!!!   Sure, these are only the shallow front #'s -- but these are also the ""cover story"" -- what retail investors see first -- and PE -1.1 is repelling.   New investors will wait (like me) for better entry.3. The 2nd generic of Copaxone will really take it's toll, causing Copaxone revenues to plummet more this year... and we'll see the impact of this through year-end.I see no good short-term reason to buy TEVA.  Why tie up my money only to suffer a short-term downside.  I bought last year at $17.40 avg price, and sold out at avg price $22, for about 26% profit.  That was a nice ride.  I hope for trading's sake that TEVA takes another big dive short-term, and permits me another great re-entry.Note, that my previous investment was crazily 100% of my portfolio, as I dumped in the remainder of my funds at < $15.  I was THAT confident in TEVA recovering to $20+, short-term.    Now, though, following the ER, I think we're headed back down to < $15.",
"I can't invest in TEVA right now. I can't value it - too many uncertainties. I was considering a speculative purchase if it got down to around $15 but doubt it does that now that Berk-Hath bought some.Once it finds a bottom I'll be able to really assess it and make an informed decision. On the plus side, it should have enough volatility that you can make money trading it but right now it isn't for me.Haven't quite decided what I think when people trot out the ""top generics company"" argument. Is that a plus? In the current environment I don't see it as a positive though things could turn around longer-term.",
"Jason, Re: Market share for US genericsTake the TEVA and Allergan and add those together and that will match the more updated figures for market share.   Otherwise, that was a good explanation of your thesis, and I happen to agree with your analysis, so well done. Thanks.",
"You're missing the boat if you think that Copaxone's high price somehow makes it fairly immune from a generic hit! If the patient doesn't seek the lower cost generic from Mylan, then the patient's insurance plan will force the issue by slapping a giant copay on that makes the generic almost free to the patient but the branded drug cost a small fortune. The patient will follow the financial incentive. And Mylan's drug will not be any less efficacious either. They are a quality producer, the generic will be a good copy. No way Teva retains a 60% share!",
"Buffett had nothing to do with buying Teva and suggesting so displays a profound lack of understanding how Berkshire Hathaway operates.  That said, the buyer (either Ted Weschler or Todd Combs) is certainly a world class investor.",
"I am long Teva, but two things in this article seem contradictive to me. It is mentioned that Copaxone competition is not a problem and a 60% of 2016 Copaxone earnings is suggested (which I think is optimistic, because of market share loss *and* price reduction), while at the same time arguing that generics are not that important. If Copaxone is not important and generics are not important, which product segment then is the important one? Anyway, I remain long Teva because of the cost cutting measures. I think the CEO will reach the goal of $3B per year, while reducing the debt. Things will look good in 2020 and even better going forward.",
"$40 is way over optimistic in my opinion. if everything goes to plan (which is rather impossible) stock may reach $30s also, before or after buffet doesn't mean anything. maybe they already sold, maybe it's still undervalued.... doesn't matter",
Opinions about the future of TEVA are very split here on SA but I tend to agree with your analysis for the following reason: Generics are here to stay and there will be more not less in the future. Size matters and TEVA has one of the biggest production/distribution facilities in the industry and chances are high that the company will survive. Size also matters when it comes to debt but in this regard I believe the new management will be able to solve the problem and steer the company back to a solid path in the next 2 to 3 years. WB's investment and the fantasies it evokes are another reason for optimism. I would not dare to set a precise price target in terms of price and time but I expect at least about 30$ down the road.,

Any ideas why AIMT is waiting so long for BLA?,
"Thanks for stating your long.. ""Please see POST "" was not really helpful.","U.S. Biotech/Pharma Sector Daily Observations Letter: February 26, 2018"
I have spoken with folks from DBVT and AIMT today at the conference and both now project FDA approval mid-late 2019. They used to claim 2018. AIMT is going to file a BLA at the end of the year. That is just what they told an average joe allergist off the street.,
I believe the real winner here will be a combination of AIMT AR101 together with dupixant or ANAB020 - immune-modulators. A periodic dose of dupi combined with up dosing will limit GI reactions tremendously and make maintenance potentially an at home event. My belief is that DBVT will also get approved and will take the cake for a lot of safe parents who cannot manage up-dosing schedules but long term AR101 in combo will come on top.,
"For those that can tolerate this tx, this could bring a much needed peace of mind for both the child and parent/caregiver. Not sure this will sell quickly until trust (of the protocol) is established by both the physician and parent. Market turning down today so may have another chance to buy under $30. Stock could go to $45 by EOY.",
Ahh.... Took it literal.. Analyst increased PT by 7 that i follow and noted a conference  next week that could boost the stock...,
"I am literally a pediatric allergist with a special interest in food allergy. I have been preparing my patients for the DBV patch and Aimmune oral immunotherapy when FDA approved. Here are my thoughts about AIMT:1. Their product is simply a highly quantified form of peanut, not a proprietary drug or genetically engineered peanut, so their only real IP is the protocol, which can be easily replicated with over the counter forms of peanut, like peanut flour. Patients can start on AIMT's peanut and then switch to regular peanut for maintenance, or they can simply skip AIMT's peanut and do the protocol with regular peanut. I will probably use a combination of these approaches. I think the number of patients on AIMT peanut long term for maintenance will be very low. 2. Updosing occurs every 2 weeks in a doctor's office, the kind of doctor willing to treat immediate allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, primarily in children (this rules out primary care, almost all ENT specialists who dabble in allergies, and a good chunk of older adult focused allergists), which leaves food allergy-focused peds allergists, a very very small group with limited capacity.3. When I describe these products to patients, they ALL (literally 99% of my peanut allergy patient parents) LOVE the idea of the peanut patch, due to the safety (basically zero risk of having a potentially life-threatening reaction from the patch), and due to the convenience of avoiding the office visit and the stress of increasing the dose orally every 2 weeks, even though I tell them it is less effective. I bet most will want to start on the patch and then save the AIMT peanut as a last resort if their child is not perceived as responding to it. Perception is everything here, sometimes just ""doing something"" even though it is ineffective serves the purpose for some families, like the folks that go to mexico for stem cell injections. 4. Due to the total lack of serious adverse effects, the patch could be easily prescribed by primary care and other non-allergists, vastly increasing the number of prescriptions.They might be inclined to do this once they see our eventual waiting lists for oral food allergy treatments like AIMT's peanut.So what we have is AIMT - superior ""drug"", inferior practicality, few prescribers, parents leary of it vs DBVT - inferior drug, more prescribers, and parents irrationally LOVE THE HELL OUT OF IT.I could go on all day about this because this will be a huge part of my career over the next decade.",

"GE may be on the way to recovery, but until the accounting system is made far more transparent, I will continue to assume that the numbers are manipulated, as they have long been.  Even now, operating losses at GE Capital are routinely bundled and delivered as ""one time adjustments"" so as to preserve apparent earnings.  The costs of long term care reinsurance are not a sudden surprise in 2018.  They have been apparent for years, but have been ignored in order to one-time them.  How can a retail investor possibly trust the quarterly reports when this nonsense is still going on?  GE needs to acknowledge their past accounting tricks and give a detailed explanation of their move to better transparency with each quarterly report.",

"The fear and loathing isn't ridiculous, it is entirely rational and based on sound evidence.a) Sold or divested businesses that generated billions of $$ every deal in cash flow and dividends to parent co.b) Supposedly to reinvest in core industrial operations. How's that working out?? Not only are we NOT seeing increased cash from industrial operations, cash flow is actually melting down.c) On the other hand, GE managed to be stuck with billions of liabilities from businesses they divested that we continue to learn about now even though businesses were divested years ago -- insurance liabilities, subprime mortgage liabilities, pension liabilities. So from the vaunted divestment of GE Capital, we have none of the cash flow, where are the proceeds, but are still stuck with the liabilities. If there has been a worse job of capital mgmt & stewardship in the history of American business, I would very much like to know about it.",
The pension is $31 billion underfunded as is THE most underfunded publicly traded pension. It is criminal. Years of share buybacks served only to prop u this stock and is now essentially flushed down a massive toilet. They sold the capital business way to soon. There are way WAY better places to invest than this company.,
The GE balance sheet is bad.  Using just that we should not think this a good investment anytime soon.  Add bad news to this proverbial fire and we get where we are now. Going lower.Anyone saying $30 per share is not being realistic.  A lot could change which will determine the future share price and a lot of it could change for the worse not better.,
"This might be the only piece, using that term loosely, that iterates a strong buy on this company. I am not a professional securities analyst by any stretch but when even the insiders aren’t buying at these levels one’s gotta question credibility here when the news over the last 90-days is termed “minor”?  I’d be very interested to see this firm’s track record.  If the author could publish it would be appreciated. For those that enjoy Warren Buffet, and reality, yesterday he gave 3 hours of his time from 6-9AM on CNBC. Obviously the man is getting on in age but damn he is still sharp as a tack. The one thing he mentioned that really made my ears perk up was the liability associated with LTC. Further he mentioned it was an area that even he got caught off guard by at BH because the actuarial assumptions (no deference to actuaries reading here) were significantly off. Further he mentioned he was shocked at how much exposure GE Capital still had. This IMHO is not a small statement and implies to me there is more, potentially a lot more, to come with LTC. The question is how strong is GE’s borrowing power here in light of all the other headwinds. They already shot one bullet to kick the pension discussion down the road with the rationale they are taking advantage of the low rate environment.  Well that is changing too as is GE’s credit outlook.",
"There are times when reading some of the articles on this platform leave you shaking your head.  GE is in the midst of a management melt-down and the current management is trying to right a sinking ship.  They  are still trying to unravel GE Capital and I would suggest no-one, including the author, has a clue what is in the closets there.  So here's my question to the author with his strong buy rating:  If you had fifty thousand, or a hundred thousand, to invest in any stock, where would you invest in:  Amazon?  Google?  Berkshire Hathaway?  Disney?  GE?  Don't spend too much time thinking about it, you can hardly suggest GE would be the better investment against any one of them today, tomorrow,  or even next year. In truth investing in GE right now is nothing short of a gamble: an investment you might make if you had a ten year time-frame.  GE is in the midst of a massive restructruing.  Managment's credibility is in the sewer, they have $20 billion in assets to unload and until all these matters are resolved, the stock remains, at best, a risky gamble.  Management should spend some time regaining the confidence of their employees and pensioners, since they have done quite well taking care of themselves.  Will it get back to $30, which use to $40?  Sure, probably in three, five or ten years.  A lot has to go right and, until then, it will probablyi take on the aura of IBM less the managment incompetence.  What transpired here was a disgrace and for analysts to be looking solely at their valuation numbers versus the wreckless actions of GE's managment and their board, is a disservice to readers.  Flannery promises transparency.  Great!  I want full disclosure of what occurred, who was involved, and what the personal penalties were for doing what they did.  I want to know why there is no discusxsion about claw-backs of monies paid to Immelt, Sheirn, Bornstein, Neal, as well as the Board members and other executives, who reaped exit packages, stock options and awards, and cash bonuses.  I want to know the specifics of any stock option repricing that was done over the last ten years.  Lets talk about how GE's executives, including Flannery, watched this monster be created, benefitted from it, and now can't distance themselves fast enough.  I'll listen to Flannery when he claws back the exit packages given to Immelt, Sherin and Bornstein for starters and returns the bonus he and others received for the disastrous Alstoms acquistiion: until then, I'm buying Berkshire, Google and Amazon.",
"My view is that GE is about fair prices at these levels. All air is out of the stock price and an underperforming conglomerate with 90 cents earnings per share should trade around these levels. There’s upside if / when power and oil return to strength. But for this stock to go back to 25, we do need to see double eps first and that’s not going to happen anytime soon. It basically a dividend stock from here on with arguably not enough yield yet for the risk.",

Yet a few months later they drop a bomb about massive under-reserving for insurance payouts and lower guidance yet again.  Then we still have an SEC investigation that's just begun to unravel the decades of fraudulent financials - guaranteed no good news there - and if there were any justice, indictments would rain down on current and former management.

"I agree with JF that this company looks very interesting. I have been trading around between 18-21 over last several months. I have mixed feelings if I should get in for the long period of time and stick to it hoping that it will get approvals in other categories such as lungs, brain metastases and pancreas. Positives are: possibility of approval for mesothelioma within 12-18 months if data is good, stream of money from current approved use, possibility of CMS starting paying their bills. Cons are: because it is never a cure it needs long studies to show benefits in survival, also there may be other emerging technologies coming during that long time that their studies take, showing better outcomes than Novocure. Novocure has to show improvement using current standard treatment combined with their technology. By the time Novocure finishes their study a new drug may come that is much better than a combination, putting Novocure back in the qua to do another combination study with a new drug. Anyway, I think it is interesting company and it would be actually a good take over target for a device company.

Basically his $5 million investment in the common shares has netted him $300 million, i agree the $300 million does not go into his pocket but is he in the position to pocket compensation to $20 million discretely therefore netting himself a tidy profit while investors blindly continue buying common shares believing the CEO average cost for his shares is around $8.30 not realizing the CEO has already netted a profit ??",

Thanks for the article. Interesting company.,
An interesting look. Telecom companies are all being lumped together as bad investments. This article shows to importance of DD.,
"Good lord, what an optimist. Actually, there is quite a lot to lose in this stock even now. Speaking about key points below:Veon's past currency headwinds are now strong tailwinds. - Rub appreciation is totally tied up to growth in oil prices, so if you believe that the growth will continue.Under the new management team, VEON has become a pioneer of digital transformation in the telecom industry - CEO has been around since 2015, and the stock price went down by 1/3 since then. CFO was fired in this October. The VEON app has like 30k users in Russia, same goes for other markets. Not sure who this will count as ""digital transformation"". I recommend checking glassdoor, for instance, to see how this transformation is going:)60% of VEON's customers are located in the path of China's Belt and Road initiative, offering a strong growth outlet - probably in Pakistan only. In Bangladesh VEON is a distant number for 4, same goes for many Eurasian's markets. Even if there will be growth (which is far from guaranteed - didn't happen in the past), VEON isn't in position to capitalizeVeon is trading for 5 times FCF and sports a 9%+ dividend yield. It is cheap for its underlying growth opportunities. - Supports for this year. Actual cash flows is negative $1.5bn, same goes for the previous years (i.e. negative cash flow). So the company is burning through cash despite having EBITDA margin of 40%Let's not forget very questionable governance with recent corruption scandals (more than 1bn in fines)",
I think VEON is beaten down.  Certainly they have issues and challenges ahead.  But a share price approaching $3.00 seems crazy.  Thanks for the article.  I’m doing my research.,
"The share price didn't react well to the recent results, and there are some good reasons for it.- net debt rose during the year. Not sure where the FCF went but certainly not towards deleveraging- the $1bn FCF you and the company refer to is an adjustmed number pre-spectrum payments (which amounted to 350m in 2017 if memory serves me right)- a number of the smaller markets are under pressure, which is not currency-related (ie Bangladesh where they are the #3 player and are probably loosing market share)I don't necessarily disagree with your thesis, but I don't think the FCF yield is actually 20%, and would like to see clearer signs of a deleveraging trend before getting excited about the name.","VEON: Nothing Left To Devalue, Time To Buy"
"Thank you all for the thoughtful discussion.  It is most helpful as I begin my DD. There are very few technical products that ""sell themselves"".  As health care consumers and investors, we may wish for the rapid adoption of break through life saving medical products, but the sales process takes time.  Placement of a machine in a lab will require several visits and presentations by representatives.  The lab/hospital almost certainly will have a review process that will take a hard look at the considerations discussed above, alternative technologies, and budgetary implications.  Assuming the review is positive and a machine is placed, revenues won't start to flow until physicians begin to incorporate the test into their SOC.  Ramp up of tests will depend on the experience of the early adopters.  An example of this in the cytokine release treatment space is Cytosorb (CTSO).  They have a technology for filtering cytokines from blood that is approved in Europe and in trials in the U.S..  This is another razor blade type business. The ramp up of sales in Europe was excruciatingly slow until recently. It will be interesting to see their Q4 results.  Note: I am currently long CTSO, but will be reviewing that position after their results.With TTOO, it will be interesting to see the ramp up of revenues on machines that are currently in place when and if the new panel is approved.  That will be an early indicator of the prospects for the technology, revenue ramp up and conversely the likelihood and level of dilution.Good luck to all.",
some great responses and critique of the company. Today news is good and a necessary step for pushing further adoption as current Bacteria only cover 5 species of Bacteria.  Cash burn is a concern but I am sure Goldman Sachs will push this higher and do an secondary offering at a much higher price or t2 mgt will get a collaboration agreement in place with Allergan. Lots of possibilities for financing growth here but I too believe it will take years to get traction of this technology unless they team up with a larger sales organization.  What they are trying to do is change the standard of care and do business (in this case medical) process re-engineering which has been in place for 50 years.  Lots of uncertainty but lots of value in the current IP,
"Hi, Folks,All the long-winded discussion does not mean a damn thing, why waste so much real estatetalking about TTOO this and that, I think you guys must be very smart right?

"Bruster, you clearly have your opinions, and that is fine and part of the value of SA. There are two sides to every coin, so I am simply presenting a more reserved (although not entirely negative view), based on clinical level data. I don't know you, and you don't know me -- so stating that I am ""exactly why medical care lacks initiative and creativity"" completely belies my CV, but we won't go there.  I certainly am not ""old school"" -- and if you have 25 years of health executive experience and are retired, I was still in grade school when you were part of the status quo you critique. And, if you simply want to believe the positive views driven by the company and its allies, without independently appraising the data and methodology-- you can have the option to mute me, and good luck with your strategy. There are many others who appreciate the balanced discourse.As for the issue of paid consultants -- each study/presentation must disclose its conflict of interests, per recommendation of the IoM and specific institutional criteria.. You can find this at the end of any published study (now a requirement of the peer-review process), or at the beginning of any visual presentation. It is fair game to point these out -- this is why it exists. I have not accused anybody of unethical practices -- quite the contrary, I have stated that these consultancies and research grants are a necessary and unavoidable part of medical advancement in this day and age. Its another data point to consider when you cross-examine a conclusion -- for the same reason any SA contributor is required to state their  financial interests after a article. Its there for a reason, so that a reader can independently judge the claims.  I also share your hope that we can rapidly treat sepsis, by immediately and accurately identifying the causative microbe, allowing targeted therapy. What I am pointing out are the realistic issues that adopters (clinicians) will consider, and T2Bacteria's real limitations, that lead to T2's adoption risk. We agree on the goal to be achieved -- just not the fact that T2Bacteria will magically achieve it.  To save you keystrokes on your next rant -- I am a ""Sir"", instead of ""SIR or MADAM"". :)Finally, to your claim ""In Europe it is too bad they have all socialized medicine for most part. "" Finally, something we agree 100% about.All the best, Bruster-",
Hold over earnings? What’s your opinions? Possible surprises in either direction?,
"To help every reader get the overall strategic product direction as this author's article stated, which I almost largely agree with, IMHO,""According to the Agency for Health Research and Quality, septicemia was the costliest condition treated by hospitals in the U.S. costing an estimated $23.7 billion in 2013, or 6.2% of the cost for all hospitalizations. A recent report by the Sepsis Alliance bumps that figure up by $3.4B in 2016, to about $27B. More than 1.5 million people get sepsis each year in the U.S, and about 250,000 Americans die from sepsis each year. Also, one in three patients who dies in a hospital has sepsis.""Do your own due diligence but TTOO is an emerging and potentially fabulous company that potentially moves the standard of care for sepsis way beyond what currently exists. Do not rely solely on negative opinions which as always exist in almost every medical advance since the beginning of time.Many of the biggest and best international healthcare systems have already published T2 results that have saved them millions of dollars and/or improved health outcomes. I hope that we do not have to tolerate giving mega-doses of unnecessary types, levels, and amounts of antibiotic treatments to our loved ones just because that is the defacto status quo, as reported by others, who negate the importance of these advances, as some state despite these great Health Care System studies and results.",
"Cerepundit (and to some extent others)Do not mean to single  out but you are the type of commentator that exactly demonstrates why the state of medical care lacks initiative and creativity when there there are VERY CLEAR INDICATIONS AND ADVANCES at hand. Too bad you do not see how HENRY FORD for example saved $2.9 million in cost in their limited study. And YOU suggest they were ""paid off' consultants. I am going to report this as abuse to SA since you have no basis for accusing Henry Ford of improper/unethical practices. I am hoping they see your completely unfounded allegation (you were there?) and take action if they see that as appropriate. You SIR or MADAM simply discount as unethical what you do not believe is possible, YET YOU admit you have no personal experience with using T2 clinically or in any other way?. Or please let us all know how you were some kind of insider to this? And how you have managed to obtain first-hand information about why these advances in one of the MOST DEADLY US diseases is unfounded based on your opinions, again despite what the actual MAJOR INSTITUTIONS  have reported. Who are you to oppose what they say and what they found and what they published? If you are such an expert why were you not asked to  be involved?I am no expert in biology just a retired health care industry executive who has seen the same thing over and over and over in others (I do not know you). The ""old school"" defend their turf while others advance practice.When I see what is reported by major institutions to be a substantive advance in sepsis DX and care I want that moved forward. Unlike your curt retort to my comment that I would not seek a T2 ER or hospital for me or my loved ones to receive care at you are wrong to directly disregard what I said. I am going to see to it that my family are I receive the best of DX and treatment. I am ""not going to my local ER"".In Europe it is too bad they have all socialized medicine for most part. Perhaps that contributes to low current T2 adoption rates there. And as you imply in US we just ""bomb"" patients with almost lethal abx combinations and hope for the best as some of you apparent clinicians are suggesting continue to be US standard even before a formal dx. Sorry that is not going to remain standard of care. People do not want expensive potentially damaging high potency abx that are not related to a more specific dx. How about we get to advocating advancing the practice of medicine not just staying stuck in present dysfunctional/deadly/c... mode.That is what I see T2 doing is ""burning"" $50m/year so we don't have quite as many thousands dying of sepsis and billions wasted on unneeded abx!!! Sir or Madam do you not see the current model for sepsis Dx and treatment is not working and will never work? We need dx in hours not days to which you also discount.Maybe we can put our heads together and help make some progress in med dx and treatment, not just criticize the less than 100% perfect efforts of those who are currently doing do so in world famous health care systems.",
"Good discussion with TradeATM and Oliver, if I can weigh in-""T2 is offering diagnosis of missed cases and earlier antibiotics.""  I think this is certainly the investor-level narrative that the company wants to promote, but I do not think it is how T2 will ultimately be used.  A ""diagnostic"" test can be broken down into two parts: ability to rule in a diagnosis (specificity), and ability to rule out a diagnosis (sensitivity).  If you look at http://bit.ly/2FcPyPf  @ 3:31 , there is a slide that offers the sensitivities and specificities for the T2 RUO. In short the sensitivity data is not spectacular (average 84%, 60-99% for various species), the specificity is better 87-96%. What does this mean? The T2 test is good and *confirming* (ruling-in) a specific microbe, in that a positive test most likely confirms presence of the 6 tested species. Conversely, the T2 test is not very good at excluding the possibility of bacteremia -- ~15% false negative rate even for the 6 tested species . . .  and significantly lower when including the possibility of other species that the panel does not test for.  As such a positive T2 test can be useful, a negative T2 test will not trump clinical suspicion. So how is this useful clinically? A negative test is hard to interpret, and clinical context would be needed (you probably would not de-escalate a clinically suspicious patient based upon a negative T2 test). A positive test (without sensitivities), may allow a preliminary de-escalation, but the exact action is very nuanced (see MRSA vs. MSSA discussion above). The T2 test may be more useful in surveying treatment effect -- e.g. monitoring presence of one of the 6 known species in the setting of antibiotics, to determine clearance of the microbe -- with implications on regimen. This latter point, may be the ultimate true value of the T2Bacteria test.I am wondering if this how the the company is trying to gradually pivot. In the Candida world, with the DIRECT2 and STAMP trial, the focus was less on detection -- and more on the T2 result in the setting of antifungal therapy. In Dr.Ononye's talk, the specific case reviews focused on surveillance culture samples, and picking up signal in the setting of treatment (in addition to picking-up non-blood infections in blood) .All of this points to the fact that T2Bacteria may have clinical value -- it just not will be as dramatic or quick as T2's investor narrative suggests.  The question is will the company have enough runway to withstand a protracted clinical exploration period, and any competition that may arise in the interval period. In the meantime, enjoy the pre-approval rally!",

"CerepunditDid you read the last sentence of the article you quoted, ""In conclusion, non-culture Candida diagnostics have potential to advance patient care, but this promise will be realized only if users understand tests' strengths and limitations, and plan proactively for how best to employ them at their hospitals.""Yes that is where well informed patients are going to end up is in hospitals and with physicians who know how to use the T2 panels.Personal example. I went to a medium sized private hospital to get blood transfusion as my HGB was very low. No evident reason why. For 3 days a crew of independent private docs gave me every test they could think of. No diagnosis so I took their test results to Mayo in Jacksonville. The GI doc there immediately dx'd the problem. For those folks who want to go to lesser places for serious problems good luck. I want me and my loved to receive the best care from the best docs who use the best of current and developing technologies. That is hardly optimism it is simply hope that is grounded on better results, which T2 is currently contributing to for those providers willing to be better than average.",
The “experienced pattern recognition”  or empiric therapy and the “misses” that inevitably come with that is what T2 is targeting. Generally speaking Physicians seem to get their Patient on the right ABX at least 60% of the time (only with their first prescription) with the little information they do have. Which is kind of remarkable. I get his argument...in this nuanced world does T2 move the needle far enough to garner fast adoption? I appreciate the more reasoned and reserved viewpoint here. Especially considering their cash position and competition they face.,
"Cerepundit I am wondering what your motivation is in critiquing this technology never have used it yourself ""in a real world setting"". The hospital systems that have used it in trials obviously are pleased with the results. No test is going to be perfect. The question is whether it is going to advance the standard of care.The CDC obviously thinks the fungal will are you saying they don't know what they are talking about? Nor Henry Ford?If one of my loved ones might have sepsis I would demand T2 panels. I would refuse to rely only on a doctors ""gut suspicion"". That is NO standard of care otherwise why are so many thousands of people dying from sepsis? The answer is not lack of doctor's suspicion it is lack of ability to use diagnostic tools like T2. If your conclusion is that T2 is of little value then I guess your suspicions and guesswork are quite contrary to what the users so far have been able to successfully use the panels for.",

"BMXMF reported results today and stock is down 10%+, though mostly related to adverse exchange rate effects.....meanwhile TTOO and AXDX are both up again...",
"This is like deja vu from 4 years ago in this same forum. Speculation and eventual FDA approval of T2Candida led to investor giddiness, only leading to an exponential decay in value as quarterly results came in and adoption was stagnant. Now T2Bacteria is on the verge of FDA approval, and a different set of SA cheerleaders are now again falling for this again. There is more to the analysis, than looking at top-line company driven and generic sector narratives. Ultimately, this comes down to whether this test is technically sound, and whether it CHANGES the clinical algorithm, compelling attending physicians to order the test. The major risk with T2Bacteria, as it was with T2Candida, is adoption risk. FDA approval does not equate to clinical validation nor superiority to current standard of care -- a process that takes many years, clinical trials, peer-review and publication, and finally dissemination within the physician community. Furthermore, the detection of only 6 species of bacteria (possibly without antibiotic sensitivities) is in stark contrast to Accelerate's much more robust species panel (albeit not direct from whole blood). The use of the Rental Reagent model, puts T2's revenue squarely as a direct proportion to bedside clinical adoption -- meaning that attending physicians will have to [1] be made aware of the test, [2] be convinced by use or by published evidence that it has meaningful value, and [3] have value reinforced by actual performance and implications of the test. That will not happen in the near future, and could take many years. The battle will be won in the trenches. Ultimately, the question will come down to whether T2's  LEAN coverage panel (6 species) but DIRECT from whole blood, provides more significant value than AXDXs more robust panel, that requires BC. My own gut, as an experienced clinician, says a coverage panel of 6 species is a bit to sparse to significantly alter clinical care, due to the hundreds of other species that can still be present. I see Scenario 2 as most likely, with revenue climbing very slowly -- with possible dilution events occuring in the interim.  I think the story will play out similar to T2Candida.  Will be intriguing to watch-",
A FDA that lets people die in the hospital because their power trip causes a delay in approval of life saving innovations is the equivalent of the Broward Deputies.,

"I read with interest the comments about how fast this will ramp up assuming approval for the bacterial panel. One difference with the previous candida panel is now they have an existing client base who would likely add the bacteria panel quite fast since they already have the machine in their labs. However, rolling it out beyond that may still take time. The CEO at a conference presentation in 2017 explained it's not an easy sales cycle because they usually have to convince multiple decision makers in a client institution: lab director, multiple drs who work with sepsis in the hospital, plus the CFO/financial function. Then they all have to see the business case for it and agree to start using it. I agree it would roll out faster if they partner with a bigger co with a larger sales force. I don't know what their plan is on that score at this point as they have not disclosed anything publicly on that yet. My guess is they might be willing to do such a deal, but they want an approved bacterial product first before negotiating anything like that. If they go it alone, I expect this will take time and probably be a source of some frustration to shareholders.",
"Scenario #2, where FDA approves but revenue climbs slowly, is the most likely outcome.  Look at AXDX, revenues here just don't explode.  AXDX is running heavily in the red, and for TTOO I am concerned that they will be too.  The bright side, in my opinion, is an FDA clearance could be a trigger for M&A.  The revenue could go a lot faster with the backing of a large sales force, which is how an acquirer will look at it.OH",
"Great article this says most all of it ""The company's T2 Magnetic Resonance technology (T2MR) aims to lower mortality rates, improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of healthcare by helping medical professionals make targeted treatment decisions earlier.""Having been a healthcare exec for about 25 years let me state it slightly differently. TTOO products will/are becoming the ""standard of care"" at least in treatment of lethal bacterial and fungal sepsis infections. Every hospital in US is going to HAVE to be using it to test for lethal sepsis infection and get highly reliable results back in a few hours not 4-5 days with blood cultures. Using TTOO will improve mortality/outcomes data, and drastically reduce costs because it all but eliminates the possibility of beginning to treat sepsis based on another tests false positive results.The other companies mentioned do not have the same quality/relatively low cost technology with at or near FDA approval. The big challenge for TTOO is for them to meet the sudden demand for their bacterial product upon FDA approval. Perhaps partnering here with another large medical company makes more sense than trying to develop their own marketing and distribution channels.The CDC decision on the fungal product was a HUGE plus for the company and missed by Wall Street,Very long TTOO, IMHO.",
"Great article.   Would you be able to share actual or relative pricing for the basic machines and the ongoing pricing for using the panels?

I’m holding so hope you are right,
"Thanks. Great article. Recently had the opportunity to meet with T2 CEO and asked about the time the bacterial panel evaluation is taking (5 months so far) vs the candida one (4 months). FDA had a change of director for the invitro diagnotics group. The process this time around is using more people to evaluate it, which is making it slower. T2 has answered a number of questions and management feels they were all reasonable and that T2 had the data to answer them. Average time for approvals in this category is 6-9 months and the 4 months they got for the candida panel was exceptionally fast. Lastly, the former director for invitro diagnostics is now an independent consultant and T2 has retained her services, so hopefully theu are getting good advice on the process. It looks likely that the bacterial panel will he approved within 1-4 months.",
"I wouldn't be terribly surprised if the FDA approval comes through, the share price surges and T2 decides to take advantage of the price surge to raise additional cash by issuing shares.",

"First thank you for a fine effort here Edward Vranic, CFA. Your keen insight was refreshing and for calling up Mark C. to fact check/do research. Now here are my thoughts. I'm long MDXG and will be investing in MDXG more. MDXG's leadership has thrived in spite of these short seller attacks for many years. Short sellers and naked short sellers target the Biotech sector heavily because of the high beta stocks, emerging companies (easy prey), FDA approvals are tricky at best and greater risk reward ratio. MDXG's leadership has countered all the short sellers claims by posting a short seller response section on their website's homepage. They counter with logic, facts and rational explanations (e.g. they are not responsible for what distributors do period). A fair and balanced article should have mentioned how EXCELLENT, astute and legally correct all the short seller responses have been (as of 2/27/2018). MDXG has won several lawsuits and lost none that I recall since 2008. Additionally, MDXG's execs are heavily invested in developing new product lines, patents and opening up new markets/sales channels vs. maxing current EPS, so they are long-term strategic thinkers who always have the end game in mind. They've beaten ALL the naked short seller attacks since 2008, which takes a lot of brains, grit, money, lawyers and MBA acumen. The lead short seller here is shorting a great company, with great products, employees, diversified income streams, many US patents in a GREAT BULL MARKET that will only strengthen as new tax law takes effect with corporate tax rates dropping by 21%. Let me also add that tons of smart value investors are swooping in to buy MDXG's shares at bargain basement prices. Is it is wise to follow your emotions/thirst for revenge and hurl serious accusations against MDXG? I do not think it is wise to promote shorting MDXG to a wide audience on social media and video. Why not think logically, manage risk and protect your self/family from legal liability/lawsuits? Short sellers, sometimes bowing out gracefully is the best course of action, this could be one of those times.   Attention",

Medicare Fraud only happens 2 ways. Fake codes that a doctor claims he did but really didn't. Using a code that is a higher payout and it should of been the lower  paying code. So medicare fraud is a huge stretch and not likely. All drug companies have a contract with medicare. That is negotiated  a year before and signed.   Accusing of medicare fraud when there is none is a crime in this case because you are violating SEC law and HHS law. Even the CFA who wrote this article should of not of put or even commented on  someone who is accusing a company of medicare fraud. Medicare is in disarray and really don't  know how to negotiate  contracts. that's not fraud !  Some of us do expert testimony for the government on medicare fraud cases.   If the company is committing fraud in accounting  or payoff that's a whole different case.,
"I don’t agree with this statement.  “45% chance that Cohodes has it completely right and MDXG will be a corpse in a few weeks.”  Until the audit is finished it will be a short, but not a corpse.

It’s all been coulda woulda shoulda for this company.I wonder what happens to the 200 million this company is lending them. Either that is confidence OR there is a covenant that they will get the whole company for 200 million once they go under and take us with them. Then this company will pick them up and sell for easy double at 400 million. This CEO is bent upon losing all his money along with ours. Down 50% as of now. Who in their right mind wants to buy more even at these prices. Gamble away though maybe you can keep the price at these levels so if a miracle happens in another year we can survive.,
"BP won't buy now, knows synergy is worth more than 3x its present price. At 200% present price they would be blamed for gouging. Plus how do they answer to there stockholders about that big of a premium",
Newbie been accumulating under $2.  Been through the biotech wars dating back to the bubble in 2000 and seen this movie before.  Need a partner here.  Don't be a greedy hero.  Make a deal with major pharma and get in the ring with Linzess.  First to market is tough to beat but it CAN be done with the right partner AND if the drug is simply better.  At this entry point it's worth the bet.,
Thanks for the write up.. watching for the sidelines..,
So the  800m  market  cap  would  be  3.25  a  share  with  246m  outstanding   Correct  ?,
Hiring the existing sales force as your own won’t make much of a difference.  They only did that in fear of loosing them.  Stock options for reps are only meaningful if the stock goes up and you’re in business long enough to be vested in them.  They are all likely hoping for a BO to capitalize on those options.   There are more important issues at play.,
This  article  doesn’t  sit  well  when  I  have  100k  invested in  SGYP  company  is  losing  more  market  share  each  month  that  goes  by that  a  larger  pharma could  be gaining   I   Guess  the  upper  mgmt  has  some  big  egos to  make it on  their  own and  at  shareholders expense !!!  I  dont  see  a  partnership  ever  and a  BO looks  to  be  4-5  years  away    Linzess  is  crap  💩   How  is  more  patients  not realizing  that  Trulance  is  far  better  and  safer  ???,
"The only thing CEO needs to do is to find a buyer/partner. Everything else is just wasting time. Or if he can’t even do that, just hire an investment bank. I am sick and tired of the depressed stock price. The announcement of the exploring a sale alone can boost stock price.",
"Lots of words have been written, most wrong. And down, down, down we continue. Whether we bottomed here no one knows. One risk of finance is removed for now. Sales look weak now but SGYP has hired its reps and given them stock bonus packages. We'll see if this gets sales revved up. Personally, a O-US deal is the only catalyst that I see that might give a quick shot to the stock. And no one has a clue if something is in the works. So on the face value of what we know absolutely the stock is stuck for now.",
"nice article, thanks",
"Reviewers at drugs.com rate Linzess as a 7.3 and Trulance at 7.6; not a huge difference but one that should pay off over time.       Really surprised that a major hasn't come in and bought this company at these depressed levels.  With a market cap at $468 million and its 'weaker' competitor pulling in over $100 million a qtr, this company in the hands of a major (which can market properly) is a no-brainer.(In at $4.50)",
From aprox. $5.15 I am down to $2.21 average. Although heavily invested if it drops to $1.70 I will keep buying. I am not in a hurry.,Synergy Pharma: Important Numbers
