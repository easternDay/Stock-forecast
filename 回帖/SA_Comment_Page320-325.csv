regarding CELGThe CELG/IBB pair took out the 10/26/2017 plunge low..the all time low was set in june 2015 and we tested it today.. the CELG/SPY pair also took out its prior low set on same day..bottom line I got stopped out of CELG long expecting further underperformance vs both indices ..comments welcome,
"@Aurhor: You wrote "" The company anticipates that 2020 EPS will reach more than $12.5 per barrel, meaning investors who invest today will have a P/E ratio of just over 8 in a few years, compared to a market P/E ratio of roughly 25.

"Great article Fluidsdoc, I keep a record of good write-ups about companies I've bought or am considering. .I bought CNOOC (CEO) last summer when it was around 110. I could sense oil was close to a bottom. I believe from where I bought CEO it will be an easy 100% gain within 1-2 years. I do not hold commodity stocks forever, like my buy/hold stocks (i.e., my Chinese buy/hold stocks PNGAY, NTES, NOAH... bought a few years ago). China depends on CNOOC. I decided it was the best choice compared to SNP and PTR.   I filed this url for my records covering CEO. Thanks!",

"""The optics are worsening"", to me it simply looks like you put your ""short"" glasses on and no longer the ""neutral"" ones! ""Cobalt prices are rising"". This argument is valid for everyone else making BEVs or PHEVs!  Shorts then come up with argument that GM or VW do not care since they can sell BEVs at a loss while making profits on CUVs/SUVs. But for how long? PSA group already raised the price of Opel Ampera-e by a full 9000eur in EU because they were not willing to sell it at a loss! With China enforcing 10% of annual sales being BEVs by 2019, big players like GM or VW have the most to lose if they can't respect those quotas. Big picture is that ICEs are increasingly expensive to produce (particle filters, ad-blue, 48V mild-hybrid, downsizing, Alu body to save weight, etc) while BEVs require much less parts and benefit from falling costs of battery packs and PM motors! ""Just a 3 second power failure, which happens there 2-3 times per week is an extremely major production killer to Panasonic who makes the battery cells inside the Gigafactory"". If that's true, who says TSLA is not getting compensated for this? Also with Powerpacks in Australia reacting within millisecond to a coal power plant tripping; TSLA could easily use Powerpacks at its Gigafactory to solve those brown-out issues, if they exist.

"As a close follower of SpaceX and Tesla for many years, I see these companies moving in opposite directions. SpaceX has become the dominant player in their (niche) industry.

Anyone who lumps these two companies together loses credibility to me.",

"Aristofanis, thank you for this article.SO, like other utilities, is facing two headwinds: (1) weakness in bonds has carried over to weakness in utilities as utility investors fear bond yields will become more competitive; (2) the recent tax legislation (for the reasons you mentioned).However, I think SO's price decline also reflects the December 21 Georgia Public Service Commission decision about Vogtle. The PSC's decision was more nuanced than usual. SO's ability to recover ongoing costs has been throttled somewhat, with the rate of return tied to their performance in completing Vogtle.

Bringing up negative equity is either done by someone with no understanding of LB, or someone with an understanding of LB who simply wants to muddy the waters and make a cheap and easily discounted point.While the fact they are able to refinance $500M of maturing  8.5% plus with 5.25% notes does save them interest (which is obviously a good thing), they are simply benefitting from the current rate environment.  They are still paying about 275 bps over comparable treasuries.As far as December comps, they were a disaster, and there is no way to get around it.  Looking at VS, which drives the business, comps were -1% on a stores and direct basis and -6% on a stores only basis.  On top of that, margins were lower than anticipated so not only did they fail to sell more on a comparable basis, their failure was at lower margins.  I believe, (and am happy to be corrected) that they have now already anniversaried their withdrawal from swim and apparel, which explains why there were no notes such as ""taking swimwear and apparel into account, the impact on comps was...."".  Clearly, and whether its due to an inability to come up with something new, manage the coexistence of bralettes and constructed bras, or whatever, the company is flailing.  Owning LB shares, I've been hoping for a different outcome, but when you impose their strategic decisions (hindsight is 20/20) on the poor mall environment, as well as their very late entry into International, and finally given CEO Wexner's advanced age (he's 80), its hard to be optimistic about the future of LB, unless you're a trader.  After Wexner is no longer in the picture, I'd anticipate that we'll see BBW and VS split up (they really have no synergies), and potentially sold off.  I'd be pleasantly surprised to see any kind of sustained rally.",

Then there`s also a ROYALTY componant to the deal, meaning with payed milestones the propability also increases that ultimately there will be recurring revenue from royalties.Thus if you have a eg. 100million NPV of the milestone, shouldn`t there then be at least another 100million in potential NPV on the royalties?chrsMartin",

"Extremely well researched.In my opinion, it sounds like the board is weak and ineffective and the CEO's have had too much power.  And I think they still do.They should have been aware that the former CEO was using two planes to fly around in at once (which is revolting), they should have stopped it and maybe fired him.They should have created better compensation plans that don't give obscene payouts for mismanagement.I watched the video you referenced on them releasing 9 board members.  In it they said this was the new CEO's decision and he's also revamping compensation...there's not enough information for me to make a definitive statement, but generally speaking, a board should not be constructed by a CEO.  As for compensation...I'm most concerned about his.  Are they setting the stage for a third hijacking of wealth?In conclusion, epic failure by the board to do their job.",
Typo above should be one time charges.,
"Mike, I just have no interest in deciphering GE financial reports. I have tried to understand ithem in the past but found too many notes, so called me time charges and lumped numbers relative to acquisitions. I could write to the CEo about my cash flow diagram, but I doubt whether, even this new management wants to be that transparent. The other unknown is the money taken in reserve against liabilities. Anyone who has run a business, knows that this area can be a hedge against a net shortfall or not done conservatively enough a surprise. Consequently reserves our generally taken on the conservative side if at all possible. As of now, I have no analytical insight as to where GE is. If we really want to create some visibility on the reported cash flow we should show up at the next stockholders meeting and raise the question. Not sure I’m up for the joust but who knows.",

"Flash, I just read a Morningstar report that GE is a number one pick for 2018, with a stock price of 26. Many of the reasons for this assessment are the same as we’ve been hearing prior to the start of 2017. I can’t help having a deja vu feeling. The report expresses  confidence in the new management and describes GE as having a “wide moat”. While I sincerely hope the report is correct, since I hold a considerable number of GE shares, I don’t believe the financial community should be so quick to voice optimism. Given the cool aid spolled out to us over  the last year and a half by GE management, the community should now adopt a show me attitude, whereby the true impact of acquisitions and significant resource allocations can both be transparent and made accountable.",

Comeback Kid ???More like the Zombie Apocalypse !!,
"None of the CEO’s purchase of shares is that significant. First for someone in his executive position, over his employment time, he is probably approaching 100m or more of net personal assets. Upon ascending to the CEO he is trquired to hold millions of dollars in GE stock and he also knows that much of the financial community sees an insider buying a lot of stock as a positive predictor of company improvement. As for cash flow Mike, it seems to me that it should be relatively simple to draw a box around the company and list the sources and sinks of cash and create an input / output  daiagram that just about anyone can understand. In fact Immelt should have demanded this diagram be created and updated monthly for his review. It turns out that he might have learned something that apparently he didn’t  Know.Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised such a diagram can’t be found in the volume of numbers GE presents that would drive a room full of eye shade accountants and certainly the average stockholder to drink. When I was at Crotonville( Ge’s Former manager’s training education center) we were placed in work groups. In mine were two graduates of the GE financial training course. We were given essentially the financials of a company including working capital requirements, depreciation,  revenue, income etc. and asked to find the free cash flow. I had in my background a graduate course in engineering economics and a work experience outside of GE where evaluation of potential acquisitions relative to measures like present value rate of return among others were required. As it turned out I was the one  who created that diagram, the financial folks were not able to do it. Maybe current GE management still hasn’t learned . More likely, they intentionally make it too difficult to follow. Whichever, only an irresponsible manager would buy back stock in the face of a looming cash flow problem or do a BHI deal or...........  Why elaborate. , it is almost unbelievable  that someone can be paid so much and  be So unaware of the important drivers  of the business.",

""" 2017 was a rough year for General Electric's shareholders, who faced a drastic dividend cut along with the stock going down 40 percent in the last year.""Really ? Who told you that ?",
"To Infinity Research (author) -""General Electric literally does not generate free cash flow at all, with the trailing-twelve-month figure being a deficit of $2 Billion."".........................  .........................  .........................  .........................Data you've presented in the chart shows ""Net Operating Cash Flow"" for the trailing-twelve-months (TTM) as positive $5.1 Billion.  To get negative Free Cash Flow (FCF) at -($2.0 Billion), the source from which you've quoted data then subtracts ""Capital Expenditures"" = $7.1 Billion.This is an incomplete conclusion since the source you've used (and others like MarketWatch) have ignored the cash received from dispositions of plant, property, and equipment (PPE).For TTM, these dispositions are positive $4.5 Billion which then makes the correct FCF at positive $2.6 Billion.  Yes, this is a low number but it is positive.  GE's financial reporting is a complex, convoluted, ""impossible to understand"" disaster.  For example, for the same TTM period, GE reports Industrial FCF = $5.0 Billion positive.  The delta between this ""GE number"" ($5.0 Billion) and what I've posted ($2.6 Billion) is $2.4 Billion which is not insignificant.  Why the difference??  Does anyone know??  Your thoughts??",

"The author seems to ignore the fact that Flannery has been credited with being instrumental in completing the Alstom acquisition. It should have been obvious that Alstom margins were lower than GE’s legacy power business. It also should have been obvious that reducing employment in France is difficult, costly and at best a slow process, Immelt promised to increase French employment as a way of getting government approval. Pundits all over this site and others hailed the deal as good for GE. I wrote several comments at the time that were very skeptical, since I actually participated in the buying of a small French company. I cautioned that the big cost synergies assumed were too optimistic and that Alstom was a declining business. I asked that the marginal impact of this acquisition be stated clearly for 2017, instead of being lumped together in one merged financial report for the power business. It was not, neither has the 3B increase in inventory in power from the second quarter to the third quaerter.explained by the new management. I suspect this increase is mostly due to the Alstom acquisition. My point is that if Flannery is brutally honest why don’t we, stockholders, have more visibility into the surprise lower performance in power? So far, the cost cutting is probably the only meaningful first step that can help  reverse the GE slide, but it will take more than that to put GE in sustained recovery. If Flannery is another portfolio  type manager whose idea of managing is buying and selling of assets, squeezing more profits from existing business without addressing  product innovation customer support and maintenance support of fielded base not much will change.",

Shame on Jack for picking SO poorly and not seeing through Jeff's BLATENT weaknesses which were more than obvious to most people who knew him. I feel bad for all GE holders. You've been had.

He plans to sell some GE assets and focus on aviation, power and health care. These have been among GE’s largest businesses under Immelt.

Once the volume dries up AMD goes down , just like clockwork. This is another proof AMD is being manipulated and is not trading on Fundamentals. If it was trading on fundamentals the stock price right now would have been >$15. Whenever we find that closing price is higher than the open and its a positive day we will find there is a structural change in price action and AMD stock price will eventually fly up.

"Jan 10 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp said some of its chipsets have been affected by Spectre, a memory corruption flaw that allows hackers to bypass operating systems and steal passwords of devices.The company is providing a initial security update to mitigate the vulnerabilities to its affected chipsets, which include GeForce, Tesla, Grid, NVS and Quadro, it said in a blogpost on Tuesday. (http://bit.ly/2DeYzXN) (Reporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza)",
"By Salvador Rodriguez and Stephen NellisSAN FRANCISCO, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Some of Intel Corp's data center customers, whose thousands of computers run cloud networks, are exploring using microchips from the market leader's rivals to build new infrastructure after the discovery of security flaws affecting most chips.Whether Intel sees a slew of defectors or is forced to offer discounts, the company could take a hit to one of its fastest growing business units. Intel chips back 98 percent of data center operations, according to industry consultancy IDC.Security researchers last week disclosed flaws, dubbed Meltdown and Spectre, that could allow hackers to steal passwords or encryption keys on most types of computers, phones and cloud-based servers.Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday the patches necessary to secure the threats could have a significant performance impact on servers.Intel will help customers find the best approach in terms of security, performance and compatibility, it said in a statement on Tuesday. ""For many customers, the performance element is foremost, and we are sharply focused on doing all we can to ensure that we meet their expectations.""Alternatives include Advanced Micro Devices, which shares with Intel a chip architecture called x86, or chips based on technology from ARM Holdings or graphics processing chips, which were developed for different tasks than Intel and AMD's central processing units, or CPUs.For Gleb Budman's company, San Mateo-based online storage firm Backblaze, building with ARM chips would not be difficult.""If ARM provides enough computing power at lower cost or lower power than x86, it would be a strong incentive for us to switch,"" said Budman. ""If the fix for x86 results in a dramatically decreased level of performance, that might increasingly push in favor of switching to ARM.""Infinitely Virtual, a Los Angeles-based cloud computing vendor, is counting on Intel to replace equipment or offer a rebate to make up for the loss in computing power, Chief Executive Adam Stern said in an interview.""If Intel doesn't step up and do something to make this right then we're going to have to punish them in the marketplace by not purchasing their products,"" said Stern, whose company relies exclusively on Intel processors.Cloud providers said swapping out previously installed Intel chips for rivals' would be too complex, but moving forward they could expand their networks using alternatives. Moving from Intel to AMD is easiest since AMD and Intel chips share a common core technology called the x86 instruction set, they said.ARM-based chips lag the speed of Intel's x86 based chips for tasks such as searches, and software would have to be rewritten.Nvidia Corp's so-called graphical processing units, or GPUs, are not a direct replacement for Intel's CPUs, but they are taking over the CPU's role for new types of work like image recognition and speech recognition.Major technology companies had been experimenting with Intel alternatives even before the security flaws were revealed.Last March, Microsoft committed to using ARM processors for its Azure cloud service, and in December, Microsoft Azure deployed Advanced Micro Devices processors in its data centers.Alphabet Inc's Google said in 2016 that it was designing a server based on International Business Machines Corp's Power9 processor. And Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services chose AMD graphics processing units for a graphics design service announced in September.Both Qualcomm Inc and Cavium Inc are developing ARM chips aimed at data centers. Cavium said it aimed to rival the performance of Intel chips for applications like databases and the content-delivery networks that help speed things like how fast online videos load.Cavium is working with Microsoft and ""several other cloud"" vendors, said Gopal Hegde, vice president of the data center processor group. Cavium and ARM rival Qualcomm work together to reduce the amount of software that has to be rewritten for ARM chips.Cloudflare, a San Francisco cloud network company, has been evaluating ARM chips. The new security patches have not slowed its performance, but it will use the security issues as an opportunity to re-evaluate its use of Intel products, said Chief Technology Officer John Graham Cumming.

"LATEST NEWS:  Market Watch article by Theresa Polletti.  Let's see who can try to use circuitous rhethoric to disqualify this, which is FACT.By Therese Poletti, MarketWatch  Opinion: Be prepared for further volatility in semiconductors and cloud services  Investors who don't like uncertainty -- and that would be most of them -- are getting a taste of what the next few weeks may be like since the surprise reports last week of security vulnerabilities, (http://on.mktw.net/2qN... Meltdown and Spectre, in most of the world's microprocessors.  On Tuesday, shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) fell nearly 3% after a Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) software patch design to secure PCs caused AMD-based systems to freeze up (http://on.mktw.net/2Fm...). The news came after AMD said last week that there was a ""near zero chance"" its chips were affected by the design flaw, (http://on.mktw.net/2qN...) which could expose private data stored in a chip's memory to hackers. So far, there have been no hacking incidents reported since the flaws were exposed by three groups of researchers, including a group at Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.  Still, investors need to be prepared for a roller-coaster ride in any stocks related to the issue going forward, especially Intel Corp. (INTC), the dominant maker of microprocessors. The Meltdown vulnerability (http://bit.ly/2Flbpob described by one group of researchers as impacting only Intel-based systems, and that software patches should mitigate the issues but they will also slow systems down. Spectre, on the other hand, which also impacts AMD- and ARM Holdings-designed chips, has no known total fix. ""There is currently no way to know whether a particular code construction is, or is not, safe across today's processors -- much less future designs,"" the researchers wrote in their paper on Spectre (http://bit.ly/2ETvYI7).  (http://bit.ly/2ETvYI7)""It's still early days,"" said Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon on Tuesday. ""People are still digging into the problem."" While many analysts on Wall Street so far are backing Intel's statement that the design issue won't have a material effect on its financials, Rasgon isn't so sure. He wrote in a note last week that Intel could potentially face some costs, such as concessions to customers. ""We wonder if there might be potential for longer-term concessions necessary, especially to larger cloud customers given performance is likely to take at least some hit,"" he wrote.  Already, Intel is under fire for a big stock sale by its chief executive, Brian Kzranich, who sold millions of dollars worth of Intel stock in late November (http://on.mktw.net/2qN...), several months after having learned about the security vulnerabilities. Intel says the stock sale was unrelated to the news of Meltdown and Spectre. Still, the timing looks inappropriate and the company is now facing threats of investigations or lawsuits from at least four law firms seeking to represent shareholders.  The entire tech industry is now working on how to deal with a design flaw written into the heart of computers made in the past 20 years in an effort to make processors work faster. But the biggest arena of impact could be the server market, where fixes could slow down computers, hurting companies like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Microsoft and others offering cloud services with low latency and fast processing while hosting the data centers of other companies.  There may still be a Pandora's box of surprises to come, and investors should be prepared.  -Therese Poletti; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com",
Anything under $15 is cheap for amd,
"So, here is where most of the group of AMD Bull pumpers post.  Those who present themselves as experts and with extensive technical knowledge and background.  Those that sang constant praises of AMD.  Those who falsely denied what Lisa Su said, which the following article proves to have been FALSE information, and cherry-picked words by the beloved Lisa Su.  Those same posters who endlessly argued with me, told me to sell my stock (I wish I had and waited to see if a rebound will EVEN happen), denigrated everything I had to say, should be eating crow; not continuing to post, extolling the virtues of AMD, and ignoring the true facts that have emerged..Here's the ugly truth from MarketWatch, that expose how deep the problem is, and the lies from AMD on ""near-zero risk""""Days after Advanced Micro Devices Inc. suggested its chips were largely unaffected by significant vulnerabilities found in a variety of processors, the rival to Intel Corp. has run into trouble. Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday said some customers found their AMD-powered computers were unusable after applying the latest security patches for the Windows operating system. On an online support page, Microsoft said it would ""temporarily pause"" sending updates to some devices running AMD processors. After investigating, the software giant said it found ""some AMD chipsets do not conform to the documentation previously provided to Microsoft."" Intel's shares sank in the two days after the chip vulnerabilities were disclosed last week, while AMD shares are up more than 15% since Jan. 2, the day before news of the security flaws was widely disclosed. An AMD spokesman at the time said the flaws posed a ""near-zero risk"" to its processors. Its shares were down 3.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday. The patch issue affects ""a small subset of older processors that were sold prior to 2009,"" an AMD spokesman said Tuesday. AMD and security researchers say the company's chips aren't vulnerable to the most easily exploitable -- but most easily patched -- variant of the security flaws, known as Meltdown. Instead, the problem that is being patched by Microsoft concerns a variant of another flaw, known as Spectre. It is likely to be an increasingly important security problem in the months to come, as researchers learn more about the issue, said Paul Kocher, an independent security researcher, who was among those who discovered the Spectre vulnerabilities. ""Once the Meltdown patches are installed, I don't see any significant security difference between Intel and AMD on these issues,"" he said. AMD should have done a better job documenting how software makers should develop patches for the chip maker's hardware and more clearly explained the security issues associated with their products, Mr. Kocher said. Rivals Intel and ARM Holdings have offered much more detailed documentation of these security issues, he said. ""Microsoft has access to our processor architecture documentation, which is essentially what is needed, and we have been engaged regularly in engineering meetings to assist since this was disclosed,"" the AMD spokesman said. Glitches are possible any time a software update is deployed. ""It wouldn't be the first time a Windows update had an issue,"" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. ""But it's obviously not a positive thing.""Especially noteworthy is the line in there that says, ""Rivals Intel and ARM Holdings have offered much more detailed documentation of these security issues.""I'm glad you all posted here, as it outs you and your true motivations.  YOU have pumped this company and stock and influenced countless investors to look at you as authorities, when nothing could be further from the truth.  Way beyond shameful - way too understated a term to describe it.",

I am not a fan boy on either side I hold stock on both companies we have worked with both INTEL and AMD, but the facts remain that INTEL covered this up for a long time. And this does not inspire confidence or trust in customers or IT professionals that recommend, install and build computers and servers. Many business owners we support have come to us and asked questions like “What else are they not telling us”? “Why did they wait so long to tell us”? “How many other problems are we going to have down the road if we stay with INTEL”? “What else are they lying about”? And the questions go on and on. And our answer is We don’t know.  On the surface is seems that greed has played a big part, removing security features to obtain more speed out of their chips to enable them to justifying charging more for their product. Never the less or what all the reasons are the big question is can you trust them going down the road? Can we be sure that profit will not be put ahead of the customers security? If now and the past is any indication of what is in the future we would have to say no!  As a consulting firm and computer shop we do not feel that we can continue to recommend INTEL products based on the current architecture Intel’s chips are built on. Patches in the short term are a short-term fix but not a long term one. And patches can be hacked as well. The only Real fix to this is a complete new architecture for Intel chips, which will take years to develop. Our Customers liability is here and now, and they are not willing to put their companies on the line with possible lawsuits due to this flaw that could have their customers personal data stolen.  We are Tech company that builds in installs servers on contract with Companies like Microsoft. In the last two days we have signed long term contracts to start building and deploying AMD Epic servers for Microsoft. This happening all over the tech world.

We think the writing is on the wall, and we think the INTEL CEO knew it too when he sold so many shares of stock.  Going forward at this time we can only recommend AMD EPIC server chips with their Secure Memory Encryption technology on board, for additional protection against just these sorts of threats. Since this nullifies any security issues without reduction in performance. Will this affect Intel as a company? Short term probably not. Long term well that will be hard to say. But what is known is Intel has lost its trust with many customers as well as its reputation.  And a lot less Intel products will be sold. So for now we feel it would be wrong to recommend Intel.So I think investors should keep in mind that many products that are sold by AMD or Intel are usually done so through counseling and support companies. Many of these companies have contracts with many companies and recommend and support,install, servers and workstations for them. Since many are afraid to recommend Intel for now, investors should take this in to consideration.",

Double or triple? I love AMD but I dont even think AMD is expecting that.,
Enertuition. What’s your track record,
"ALSO, The only way Spectre can affect a AMD system is as follows:Spectre can infect both Intel and AMD but the difference is that for AMD system to be infected and exploited (a hacker) has to at least once sit behind the AMD based computer physically prior to attacking it later on remote. (Unlikely) Whereas on Intel based systems he doesn't (The hacker) does not have to be physically present and can be hacked through the internet. This is why AMD says near zero risk to AMD processors at this time. So if you have AMD unless you let the hacker in to your house, office or data center you cannot be hacked. But if you are on INTEL well you have a problem.The other flaws do not affect AMD at all.",
"I am LONG AMD. My biggest concern with AMD is scale. Can they keep up with demand for EPYC? Can they keep up with Demand for Vega? Judging from Vega shortage supplies... That worries me. Also I google inventory of R5 2500U based laptops... There aren't many for sale. Only the HP Envy.   Get those supply channels ramping up, dang it.",
"One thing AMD needs to do better is to better control the narrative. Example: for Meltdown and Spectre, AMD could have more assertively say that Meltdown does not affect it's CPU's, therefore will not incur the performance penalty hit that Intel CPU's will, ESPECIALLY in the Data Center.  Another example: The Microsoft Windows patch for meltdown / spectre bricking some older Athlon CPU's, Microsoft blamed AMD for bad hardware documentation, making AMD look incompetent. Also headlines indicate as if ALL AMD CPU's are now bricked with the updated patch. AMD needs to control that narrative and say 1. Only very old Athlon processors are experiencing the bricking and 2. We will work with our partner, Microsoft, to resolve the issue. Also AMD needs to make sure their PARTNERS (MS and AMD have a datacenter deal with EPYC / AZURE) save their face a little. AMD has not thrown anyone under the bus, least of all Intel, and they could have. Honestly AMD has a weak ass PR / Marketing department that doesn't understand the concept of mindshare. I am a software developer so many of my co workers who are smart intelligent people say point blank they will never buy AMD again. AMD's weak PR and inabilty to control the narrative doesn't help with that. AMD should hire someone like Jim @ AdoredTV for marking consultation. Or hire me. Muahaha!!!",

"I agree with @Author that AMD has superior set of products then Intel. But will AMD be able to sell them. Unless OEM, Super 7, Enterprise customers are ready to buy from AMD these products will remain in the shelf. Eventually Intel will catch up if AMD is not able to grow and invest in research because of lack of financial resources.(Because of all the manipulation going on)Dr. Lisa Su mentioned 2018 is the year of revenue ramp up. I dont see any evidence of that so far. 2018 looks very similar to 2017 to me unless AMD can sell lots of EPYC, Ryzen Mobile and APU chips. Once these products take off only then we can think of AMD doing well.",
"Intel has a chemical engineering CEO at the top, while AMD has a Electrical Engineering PhD at   the top. Guess who will win the race in the end.

"Microsoft warns that benchmarks most sites did, are not telling the truth. They used current gen Intel processors, Windows 10 and in many cases had only installed the patch, not the firmware updates.In simple words,Windows 10 running on Skylake, Kaby Lake or newer CPU show benchmarks show “single-digit slowdowns”, but most users shouldn’t expect to see noticeable slowdownsWindows 10 running on Haswell or older CPUs “show more significant slowdowns” and “some users will notice a decrease in system performance”Windows 7 or Windows 8 running on Haswell or older CPUs means “most users will notice a decrease in system performance""Especially for Win 7 and Win 8Windows 7 and Windows 8 will be the worst hit simply because these older operating systems have features like kernel-level font rendering that will be impacted by the Spectre and Meltdown mitigations even further than Windows 10.Linkhttp://bit.ly/2Fklu4pAMD will enjoy success in 2018, simply because Intel can't fix this in hardware fast enough and have quickly a fixed processor in the market. Even if they started working on a fixed CPU 6 months ago, I doubt we will see a new, safe Intel CPU before the end of 2018. And in the next 1-2 months it's almost certain that people with older processors will start feeling the slowdowns, even if all tech sites decide to stay silent about this.

"Excellent article on AMD'S promising 2018. As an investor, I am continuously frustrated by AMD's CEO not addressing important issues as what happened today with the Window's Meltdown software problems on AMD's CPUs. I think by now, most informed people understand that Intel's CEO response last week to the Meltdown/Spectre problems was a forced action, due to the Jan 2nd story by the  U.K. paper. What frustrates me is Dr. Su's comments yesterday on CNBC, and the obvious contradiction to what played out this a.m. If AMD's CPUs weren't affected by the Meltdown bug, why did AMD let Windows download an untested software fix to it's CPUs. It is apparent that Intel, Windows, etc. are struggling to get a handle on the impact of Meltdown & Spectre, and they were still working last Tuesday on a solution, before the U.K. story broke. Why would anyone expect a solution from Windows, Intel, Apple, etc. in less than a week, when they have been working on this problem since June 2017.",

Why have we not seen any announcements that Amazon / Google are using EPYC in their datacenter. Its been more than 6months since the EPYC release and they may have been testing it even before that time period. Now we have Intel security problem but we still dont see instances of AWS using EPYC. This is strange. We dont see customers coming out and saying that they will diversify their DataCenter by using chips from AMD too.,
"the market share grab of DC was already going to be impressive.  Now with the known flaw in INTC chips, well why would you buy an inferior product at a higher price point.  Sure some will say it is a simple software fix and the performance issues after said fix are nominal, the DC community and especially the buyers know what the real impact is and not just the Brian K spin  on the impact.  I think AMD is going to be grabbing huge amounts of market share of the highly lucrative and high margin DC market.  This by itself  can get us a double.",

Ok I guess. But as a Dr. I am skeptical. Most P2 success fails in P3 and I see no logical mechanism for plant cell to release drug in colon period!But good luck to holders (Was one but exited ~ 6 months ago after horrendous earnings CC),
No one answered my question.OPRX is delivered orally and the company trumpets the fact that the plant cell allows resistance to digestion allowing the drug to reach its target. What they do not elucidate is how all of a sudden the drug is released from the plant cell when it gets to the colon. I reiterate again how is the plant cell ruptured to release the drug. The colon is not a location of digestion and does not have digestive enzymes or anything that I see that can break down a plant cell. And as far as I know microbes present in the human digestion system do not produce enzymes to break down cellulose !But it's OK if nobody wants to answer this question at least they should consider this fact,
Thank you for another well thought out article. I am long PLX and believe the science will prevail.,
I very much appreciate CC and Leona sharing their insights.  I don't believe 106 has an actual cell wall.,

You may be making a very good argument for Sanofi or Shire to either partner with PLX for 102 or purchase the drug outright.,
GLTA,
Humans cannot digest the cell wall of plant cells that is why we have molars to crush plant cells allowing digestion of the cell contents. So I do not rationally think drug will work! Anybody that can provide a counter argument on why this logic is wrong I am all ears,

You put the medicine in the category of biosimilars.Formally this is possible correctly but what about its significant superiority over competitors ? By the way, you talk about the possible superiority and expresses doubt whether this superiority will be enough to occupy a significant part of the market.Then we find out about the disappointing statistics for biosimilar drugs and you come to the conclusion that the best scenario for PRX-102 is 5% of the market. Leona S tried to return the discussion   closer to reality and reminded you in particular about partnership with  Chiesi  and recent Orphan Drug Designation from EMA. I was very surprised by your answer.

Love your articles Ms Abbot they are extremely well researched and written. Unfortunately for me I picked up shares of PLX at probably near the worst time in 2017 i.e.13K shares at an avg price of $1.28 per share and then endured the slow bleed for the rest of the year. I don't know if I would consider myself either brave or patient with PLX at this point rather merely resigned to hold it and pray that good science prevails and that the share price will eventually reflect that in the end.,
"Hi CC, Thanks a lot for the extremely valuable information, analysis and expert insights. I respect the very fact-based approach, and emphasis on not being ""overly promotional""... I do want to share, primarily for the benefit of those new to Protalix, recent developments on Fabry (PRX-102), and a slightly (my own) more optimistic perspective and leave it to them, to assess potential upside from current market cap (at around $100 Mil), and current SP.1) Partnership with Chiesi for ex-USA market; Isn't it, in a way, already ""showing the money""? :) - $25 million upfront payment  as reimbursement of past costs and upto  $25 million in future development costs (PRIOR to Ph 3 results).(JUST this $50M is half the market cap of the firm, not factoring any other revenues or IP!)  - additional up to $320 million in potential regulatory and commercial milestone payments- 15-35% in royalties from sales. Note - The partnership is just for ex-US. Protalix retains the rights for USA, which is (I understand) 27% of the Fabry market globally. 2) Is ""Fabrazyme"" really ""Me too""?! Management seems to be making a fairly strong case that it has potential to be ""Gold Standard"" therapy for Fabry disease. Pls see below - a) available 24 Month clinical trial data...Refer - http://bit.ly/2qU04IzALL data THUS far, has pointed to safety, and superiority of PRX 102 vs Fabrazyme - e.g. GFR slope -3.8 vs -2.2*, Half life 2 hours vs ~80 hours, Active enzyme ½ day  vs 14 days and Antibody presence  74% vs 0% . (Page 17 of corporate update above)b) Validation from Chiesi (just the $25M upfront payment speaks volumes, IMO).c) Recent Orphan Drug Designation from EMA;if they get EMA approval post Ph 3 data, they get ten years of market exclusivity within the European Union...""3) Going to Market with PRX 102 - What will it take? Potentially, this can be in market by 2019 - Refer your statement - ""remains uncertain whether such 'superiority' can bridge the gap in terms of financial resources."" My take - a) For EMA, the requirement for approval is ""Non-inferiority"" based on 12 M interim Ph 3 data  (the 24M data so far has proven to be far ""superior""; so odds are in favor of PRX 102 to go to market by 2019, assuming the ). b) In the table above, you list out Protalix data to make the case about disparity with other BPs it needs to compete with.For Fabry at least, I believe we should be looking at Chiesi (and not Fabry) as they will be the ones taking this to market - international presence (quite strong in Europe), $1.5B revenues and 5000 employees. With this and market exclusivity, suddenly, at least, for Fabry, 20-50% market share doesn't seem at all inconceivable.4) What is the value of PLX factoring ONLY Fabry (given the other 2 pipeline products are still in early stage).(With a HUGE thanks to Cash_Flow from over at ST ) EVEN if we assume low 10% market share from Fabry i.e. $200M and factor just 3XSales for market cap, it'll be $600 M.  With 250M outstanding shares (vs current 145M), we still get a $ 2.4 SP.When? We don't know! And it's a penny stock, with low institutional investor presence and huge float. So yes, I realize I need to be patient and brave (and have been frustrated all through 2017), but also remain - a VERY very excited long here, willing to hold for 2-5 years!!",
"CC. Great article! Question. Protalix seems to refer to current pipeline as Bio-Better to distinguish from gaucher which was a Bio-Similar approach. In 2015 they made a clear statement regarding a departure from the Bio-Similar pipeline. In your article you place 102 in the bio-similar category. Some people, including myself hope the lack luster performance of their gaucher drug will not infect the current pipeline due to the bio-better shift and therefore out perform the Bio-similar market.  Could you elaborate a bit on this?",
"Miss Abbott,It is mind boggling that everyone believes what CEO Moshe manor states at face value, In fact there isn't an analyst that has questioned it and many writers like yourself....OK....please explain to me:1) The company had $50.5M December 31, 2017, 2) There are roughly 9 quarters until 2020,3) The cash burn including all Gaucher revenues has ranged from $10 - $15M/Quarter the last 4 quarters.4) How does it make sense what CEO Manor believes that the company is funded to 2020?? By the way, in the $50.5M cash they've included the $25M upfront received from Chiesi.This is straight from your statement: ""Financial overview: Protalix indicated, in its latest update, a cash position of $50.5M as of December 31, 2017. The company projected to be able to fund operations into 2020. There is a $5.9M convertible note due by September 2018 and $59M convertible note due by November 2021. Finally, 10 years of 0% tax after using up NOL (currently around $150M).

"Abbott,Agree with you that OPRX-106 could be the diamond in the pipeline. The data looks really promising, though the trial number is so small. For UC, Infliximab remission rate is around 33% (much larger N though) . If OPRX-106 can maintain 30%+ remission rate, the market potential is huge (as an oral anti-tnf agent). This is clearly very exiting but why it's not reflected in the share price? Do you see anything suspicious in the data? Thanks!",
"QUOTE from article:  Pfizer, a multi-billion cap company, with a 15% price discount of its biosimilar drug, can only chip away 4% of J&J's Remicade sales and has to resort to a lawsuit to settle the matter. -=-=-=-=-=-=- Reply to Quote -=-=-=-=-=-=-However, you did not combine two of your own points that would change things above greatly in terms of the balance sheet... for the sake of understanding and ease, lets pretend that Pfizer is using procellex to manufacture and its the touted 1/10th production cost and we will say that J&J with classic manufacturing is using a 100% markup from cost. IF Remicade costs 100k for the patient, then Pfizers cost 85Kbut then Remicade costs 50k to make, and Pfizers cost 5kThat would mean pfizer would make 30k MORE than Remicade per dose.of course the above is illustrative as all the model remains to be seen in real lifebut lets just say that what is very hard and marginal profit at normal manufacturing cost, might be quite good where costs for production are 1/10th.. [and this says nothing about other companies wanting to make their own drugs using procellex as a service to reduce manufacturing costs, especially for short runs]",

"Trent, I applaud you for putting your financial estimates out there.  I have a question that I think if you could answer would go a long way toward shorts taking your estimate more seriously.  You estimate 1.1 million car annual run rate by 2020.   I think we can all agree they will need at least 1 more factory (many would argue two) to get to this production rate.  Given that Toyota and Mazda announced in mid-2017 plans for a $1.6 billion facility to build 300,000 cars which would be operational by 2021 (almost 4 years out).

The cars also have universally displayed poor fit and finish, although likely Tesla corrected those before giving the car to the testers. In that respect, these automag tests are fraudulent.

How much revenue did you attribute to Google Glasses? At least they had a working prototype.The fact is, there is nowhere near enough charging infrastructure to support anything close to that sort of growth. Even if there was, Tesla has lots of competitors who have proven they can efficiently produce cars. Tesla may have a technological lead now, but the market is still niche. By the time EV's are truly mainstream some of their competitors will have caught up. Those companies are funding their EV design with their current profits, not with massive amounts of debt that weigh on Tesla's profits and dilutes their shares (as most of the debt is convertible).Tesla's valuation is a house of cards. By the early 2020's they will have run out if cash, their stock will have crashed, and Tesla's assets will have been bought up by a competitor for pennies on the dollar.

TSLA's gives ridiculously optomistic guidance to keep the flow of cash coming from investors. They lose money with each car they sell and then cook the books so that the sales appear profitable. They have even been using reservation fees to feed their veracious appetite for capital. The semi truck and the impossible 0-60 in under 2 seconds sports car (with a 300 mile range) are being presented to get more capital from reservations. Donn Bailey and  John Peterson have great articles on Seeking Alpha about why the weight from the batteries will make the Semi lose money compared to diesel trucks due to reducing the amount the truck can haul with each load. The lower weight the truck can haul will require addition trips increasing the operating costs. Tesla consumes huge amounts of cash and will make whatever promises it can to keep new capital flowing in.,

"1- Overpromising and underdelivering is not unique to Tesla, but Tesla is also presented as being different than other (car) companies, so its mystique is damaged when it acts like other companies.2- I was under the impression that there was a difference between internal rah-rah and financial guidance, which, even if optimistic, is supposed to be at least a little more realistic, particularly when you are asking people to invest money in your vision based on your promise/forecast.3- At this point, Musk's forecasts are about as reliable as Vince McMahon's.  When WWE was negotiating for a new TV deal several years ago, Vince was in full wrestling promoter/hype man (""the greatest match of all time!"") mode, promising the moon and even offering to let an analyst put him in a hammerlock if WWE didn't at least double their previous deal.  When WWE ""only"" got something like a 50% increase (which wasn't that much worse than something like NASCAR and otherwise would have been a success), it was viewed as a disappointment because a fair amount of analysts/investors actually believed that WWE was going to at least double.  Even if Musk realizes his projections are virtually unreachable, he is still stringing along people, at least some of whom genuinely believe his forecasts are reasonable despite repeated failures to meet them.4- In reality, Musk's strategy seems to be working well.  Of Tesla supporters, some will continue to think his forecasts are accurate/will be met, so they'll keep pumping money in.  Others, who recognize that they are unrealistic goals, now view failure to meet said guidance as still being a success, no matter how much delayed/below target they come in.  If Tesla ever hits a guidance, everyone will latch on to how great it is; if it misses, then ""well, it was a visionary, not realistic"" goal.  As long as there are enough people whom Tesla can't disappoint, it will be able to continue until it finally achieves a goal.5- The ""to focus on quality and efficiency rather than simply pushing for the highest possible volume in the shortest period of time"" rationale is weak because multiple articles here (let alone by analysts) said Tesla Model 3 ramp was completely unreasonable, that it couldn't achieve those numbers while ensuring quality control.  That Tesla is belatedly realizing this is not worthy of praise but of condemnation; at least they realize they were on the wrong path, but they also stubbornly went down that path a fair amount of the way despite ""danger"" signs.6- With this track record (and, again, it's far from unique to Tesla), how can a potential investor like me trust their forecasts/numbers?  I appreciate Musk's vision/the big picture and whatnot, but he's asking me to put my money into a product/company, not just ""believe.""  While I don't expect sports teams that have virtually no chance to win a championship to come out and say that, at least temper the optimism somewhat.  But, again, the stock's continued performance suggests that there are plenty of people happy to invest in Tesla, so my hesitating doesn't really matter.",

Yet TSLA keeps rising on a red horrible market...who in the world would be buying this now,
5 star article. Bravo.,
The problem with pushing accounts payable out from 60 day toward or past 90 days for any supplier is that it begins to effect their cash flow.  Tesla probably has a higher percentage of single source suppliers than other auto manufactures and one supplier responding by slowing shipments slows production of possibly all models.  Cash flow effects everything as payments arrive later and later.,
"I am asking for an opinion and comments on the following:Tesla March 2022 Convertible notes which were issued in March 17, raised net 965.9 mln (principal is 977.5mln). The interest rate applicable is 2.375%. An annual interest expense of $23.22 mln. The interest rate applicable significantly lower due to the conversion feature. So far so good. Tesla is offering upside to the note investors, through an option feature, lower yield received for upside on any difference between the conversion price and price at time if conversion occurs. However, Tesla then pursues the purchased of a call spread, purchase the 327.5 call for 204.1 million and then sell 655 calls for 52.9 mln, net cost of the call spread of 151.2 mln. This outlay is equivalent to adding an extra 30.24 million in annual interest if the stock price is below the purchase of the call (assuming they are not trading the position as it relates to potential conversion). Therefore at 54.71 million the interest applicable is 5.47%. From a cash flow I'm assuming they have paid for the calls up front, although it is accounted for as stockholders equity (reduction?). I am unsure as to why Tesla would wish to pursue this strategy, as it negates the advantage of  the access to cheaper funding through a conversion given the cost of the strategy, as well as exacerbating the scenario where not all goes to plan. If Tesla is performing well the notes get converted and the stock price is higher and they can arguable raise future finance on better terms.However if there is poor performance, with a lower stock price they arguable could have trouble accessing finance, as well as potentially increase capital through further dilution. In summary, Tesla seems to be pursuing a a form more aggressive (leveraged) approach to the upside in the stock.",
"Following from the above discussion, let me posit another future course of action and ask the author and others what the implications or possibilities may be.The Perbix sale was in effect a private placement of equity to one entity. It was not a 'marketed' sale of securities to the general public. I have ventured on multiple recent occasions that Tesla's only viable choice moving forward will be the solicitation of a white knight and private placement of securities. My judgment is that there is insufficient demand for a major straight equity raise of sufficient size to keep the lights on through 2018 and into 2019. The junk debt market is closed to Tesla (and in any event may be close to cratering in general).  But someone out there may be enticed to provide funding in the form of convertible preferred stock with onerous terms (to shareholders through dilution). Could a private placement to a vetted, qualified buyer (some have speculated Chinese interests such as Tencent) be done in a manner that the Perbix sale was done? Would it be possible to issue, say, $5B in such securities using the same process as was done with Perbix? And if so....what would the market reaction be?",

The use of an unregistered offering for the first time in August to issue the 5.3% convertible notes further supports this point.""When the news about the previous SEC investigation first came out, along with hints there could still be an ongoing one, I asked this very question of Montana Skeptic in the comments section, could the possibility of ongoing investigation be the reason Tesla issued debt as it did, instead of alternatives such as new secondary?  He said no he did not think it would have precluded it, and (IIRC) if it did, it would have prevented debt offering too.

"""If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.""Good theory, except they have no earnings to dilute. You don't include options and convertibles in the EPS computation when you have a loss because it would make the loss look smaller.Also, the 5.3% notes issued last August were not convertibles. Interest rates between converts and straight debt aren't comparable. You should submit a correction.",
"Author wrote ""A second possible reason is that telling the market that the company will settle the notes in cash gives the impression of adequate liquidity. ""This is all about managing the story (pure PR).  From an arithmetic standpoint, there is really no difference between paying in cash raised by selling stock, versus paying off in stock that can immediately be converted to cash.  The bond holders get the same cash either way and the shareholders get the same dilution in the long run because ultimately ALL of it has to be raise through cash sales because there is no cash flow.The accounting works out exactly the same.

The original CFO came back on board. He must have been complict from the beginning.,
"Excellent article.  Combined with TSLA's reduction in inventory, taking deposits for vehicles not yet being manufactured, and reduction of X/S production, it is clear that TSLA is now in a massive cash conservation mode.  Whether this will this permit TSLA to survive long enough to ramp up Model 3 production and the impact on future profitability by these moves are open questions.

Of course, even if they've bought themselves enough time, and dilution is not a concern for the company (though one day it will be for shareholders) eventually they'll have to turn a profit.",

CVS-Aetna merger reminds me of when Firstar Bank bought  USBankcorp. Everyone said a little fish cannot swallow a big fish. The little fish will drown in debt. We shall see how it works out this time.,
CVS is a great long term hold. They are reshaping the healthcare industry.,
CVS lost a huge number of contracts to UNH/Optum and others.  So now they take on a massive debt load to possibly over  pay for Aetna.  I sold every share.,
I have a 2/3 full position now. I'm looking for something of a dip once the merger actually closes as folks focus on debt rather than revenues and diversification (seems foolish to me but have seen it happen quite often). Plan to fill the position out then.,

"50  Cal - What people here are missing is that the business model is changing and changing in a big way.  impersonal, institutional style SNF's are the model of the past and are extremely inefficient compared to home care or assisted living alternatives.  OHI needs to transition like others in the space already have and see where their business (revenue and earnings) falls and then adjust their distribution accordingly.  Could be detrimental to continue down the old model path--slowing or no growth will catch up with all financial statement metrics.  Just my opinion, but the research growth stated in the article supports what I am saying and not the current business model of OHI.  I know they are looking into some assisted living facilities more, this will be a good start.  They too need to dump as many SNF tenants as they can==they will continue to struggle to be profitable.",
"What am I missing here?  OHI has gone down everyday but one I believe in 2018.  Even after the tax loss selling should have put a bottom in, OHI continues to drop nearly everyday.  Now that relatives or in home care givers can get paid to look after people in need, there is much less need for companies like OHI and others in the business.  This whole sector is suffering and I think it will continue unabated for sometime.  I'm getting out now before this BLACK SWAN drops another 20%.  The gov't cannot continue to support operations like this with the rapidly aging population.  They will keep cutting subsides and implement more and more cuts in the future.",
"Disagree Andy.  OHI will continue to benefit from the growth in the SNF sector, particularly being the leader they have been over the long haul and will continue to be.  Our investment group has been long OHI for five years and our horizon window remains at 2 years+ for continued dividend growth.  We are confident that OHI's share price will rebound over the next 18 months by about 22 to 24 percent based on our calculations.

The experts you quote are stating that Home Health Care is rapidly expanding.  OHI is in the SNF space(mostly) and home health care growth has been an argument for the lack of growth now hitting the tenants who rent from OHI.  Thus you are arguing against your conclusion that OHI is a strong growth company.  Might want to pull this and fix the statements as they don't fit with the rest of your conclusion.  Growth in Home Health care is a direct conflict to growth in SNF populations.,

"I think the key to Tesla is the actual price of the Model 3.  Bulls always throw out $35,000 but every analysis (real numbers) I have seen shows avg price of $50,000 plus.  At that level, no matter if they are profitable or not, Tesla goes to BK.  There is simply not enough demand at that level to support the massive debt commitments and a market valuation greater than GM. If they pull a rabbit out of their ass and can sell it at $35,000 for a profit they may be able to hang on.  The problem I see is most bulls assume demand for cars is infinite with a good product.  It is not and is heavily dependent on macro economic forces.  Auto sales turned over in 2018 despite record low interest rates and record incentives.

"That's not true, the execution has been fine as far as the synergy stuff.  The main problem is that their end markets are going through a downturn which has caused a low share price and low earnings.  There was a financing bit that was related to share price that caused share dilution as the stock price was very low.  The company split will set it back on course.  I'm not sure what the plan is for the AG side but they stated that there were parties interested in putting capital behind it, whatever that means.",

The agricultural division turned out to not be a great fit for this model, it's cycles are too long and deep to allow PAH to carry a premium stock valuation that we need to aquire more businesses and to carry our leverage.  Farmers are looking out to 2021+ for a recovery, it's pretty bad.  The company split will allow the performance chemicals side to carry on without the AG sides problems.  I like this plan and the organic company growth has been decent.  I'm a bull but this stock is going to take a lot of patience.

"Thank you for a very well-researched piece. I enjoy reading your work. I had been a long-time follower of Jarden/Franklin over the years and could not believe they found a greater fool to buy JAH in 2016. Since finalizing the acquisition April 15, 2016, NWL's stock is down a disastrous 27%. Meanwhile the S&P has gained 35% during that time - an amazing underperformance of 62%!Acquisition roll-ups rarely create value, so it was a shame that JAH's behavior was rewarded with a buyout. But alas, NWL shareholders are left holding the bag. As you explain, the contemplated Arysta IPO is yet another head-scratcher. Why anyone would buy what Franklin is selling is beyond me.

Apparently there's a separate website dedicated to investigating Riot:http://bit.ly/2DLduJm,
"The author might be overlooking the enormous potential in one of the embedded assets within RIOT - that being their Rawhide BS3591 processing center located in northern BC from which they have been able to tap into essentially free electrical power to engage their proprietary network in the enterprise of harvesting lost Crypto currency, primarily Bitcoin at this time.  This is essentially a salvage operation to recover ""abandoned"" and decoupled currency.According to the most recent reports, Rawhide is recovering upwards of $30MM in lost currency on a weekly basis - so this income stream will drive huge valuation.  Since this is basically free money, for which the marginal cost of production is almost zero - it will have an enormous impact on the bottom line, driving fair value for RIOT well over $100 per share just on the current level of activity.Of course, the other strategic initiatives are made all the more plausible considering the Rawhide story, so together with that, we could be talking over $500 within a year and I just made all of this up out of thin air so invest accordingly..",

I dont think your ever going to get the oil bears to exit these trades with the glaring fact OPEC/NOPEC is still under supply restraint.",

Also curious on Henrik's view on the short squeeze - expected profitability and cash flow of these OSDs would not be linear with oil price, so if futures of oil go up (following any further spike in oil spot), would we not see a possible jump in fundamental valuations (beside any possible shortage of shares for any short coverage)?",

"So much energy devoted to speculating on future of addressable market, competitors, etc., grinding numbers, making assumptions on top of assumptions and projections, yet so little time spent evaluating the management.  Human capital and quality of management are more important than anything else.Start with the CEO.  Is he the guy you want to bet on?  Watch an interview or two.  And the rest of the team?  If you don't know or can't find someone at the company, go to GlassDoor and get a sense of the rest of management there.  Sure, there are always reviews from disgruntled employees (on one end of the spectrum) and company-promoted shills and suck-ups (on the other end), both of which mean little and are fairly easy to weed out.  Among the rest, for any company with a significant sample size and participation, by and large, there are themes that will help you get a basic picture.  In Roku's case, if the company makes it big, it's pretty obvious it will have to be in spite of a fairly ill-equipped CEO and below-average quality management.  More likely, the company won't realize its potential, in which case there will be lots of analysis on the products, competitors, etc. as the causes, when the real reason will be the one thing that really matters -- the quality of the team running the place.In the end, you aren't investing in a  product, you're handing your capital to people, and hoping they'll be good stewards with it, allocate it efficiently and effectively (ROIC/ROE), and make it multiply.  I see comparisons on ROKU message boards here comparing Roku with other tech companies, as though the caliber management is a constant.  It's not.  Roku is a clown car compared to the professionalism of, say, Apple.  Don't believe me?  Find someone who works there and ask.

"@author,good topic. but i am feeling that your reaching to AutoZone is an amazing short candidate could be a little too quick...i am also a do-it-youselfer on three of my four cars. but i am not one of the typical AutoZone or O'reilly customers out there. the things i did on my cars in the past 10 years: two alternators and one water pump on the BMW 7, one alternator, a whole set of brakes, and air suspension (both air pump and air bags) for the Grand Marquis. oil change per year, batteries, windshield wipers, and air filters from time to time.so alternators, water pump, brakes, both pads and rotors, filters, were ordered on-line. batteries from AutoZone and Costco. windshield wipers, oil from Costco.the difference between myself and the typical auto parts customers is, i have more cars than i need. so a car can sit weeks, or months, before i feel i want to fix it. so i can search and order on-line. so i saved some money on parts.even so if you asked me if i would order alternators on-line again, i will probably call a local parts store first. the reason is the core charge and return. and your DIY car is a Mercedes, that's even rarer than my BMW 7... our own experience is not typical. most AutoZone customers are like ROSS Store customers. they told the counter guy their car year and model and expect to get exactly what they need. if it's the wrong part, then it's the store's problem. and 99.9% of the time, it will be the right part. on the way out, they grab some small things, wipers, filter, oil, coolant, sorts of fluid...Amazon, unless they get really serious to operate in the auto parts business, they cannot do the bulk of the business that the industry is currently doing, inventory and know-how. nowadays, repairs shop will make a phone call and expect their parts delivered, like Chines food, in less than an hour or in the middle of the day, with some time left for them to put the parts in before the end of the day so customer can have their car back. that's a norm for repairs on popular makes, Honda, Toyota, GM, Ford, etc. for BMW or Mercedes, a special order occasionally might be less a surprise.Amazon has a long way to go to compete with the professionals.so shorting AutoZone or not, need to look at their sales instead?",

"Author  --  Thank you for this well-reasoned article.  It totally supports my belief that AZO's financial engineering approach to its business is solely focussed on boosting EPS, which likely benefits AZO management more than anyone else.  As AZO book value has plummeted more and more into negative territory the last few years, I finally wrote the 11/7/17 Seeking Alpha article ""Autozone's Negative Book Value"":     https://seekingalpha.c...to express my concern.Some of the comments to that article indicated my concern was not warranted, that AZO's approach was normal for retail companies and that I needed to study Accounting 101 some more (paraphrase).  Those comments came from professionals in finance.  It's possible that the game AZO is playing will work out, but I'm concerned that I don't understand its ""end game"".  AZO defends its approach by contending it hasn't affected its credit rating.  But after the ratings agencies' shenanigans before and during 2008-09, that gives me little comfort.I pointed out in my article that AZO's true owners are its creditors.  You pointed out:""When the company's largest driver of EPS growth is due to buybacks rather than organic growth, I believe investors need to really examine whether they believe they will end up being diluted in the future by new share issuance in the next recession or if the bankers (debt holders) will end up owning the company outright.""We are in total sync.Your article is the only one (other than mine) I've seen that expresses a belief that AZO's approach will not turn out well.

The stock market is not predicting a recession.  A continued rise in interest rates combined with increased minimum wage standards will have an effect on margins and eps growth. Negative book will eventually matter if there ever is a liquidity crisis.  In the short term the stock may rally but inevitably this company will file for bankruptcy as a result of its aggressive financial engineering and creative accounting.,
Look into how buybacks affect book value.,
"I see the book value argument frequently with AZO.  I think negative equity is a hard concept for some investors to grasp.  It's a little counterintuitive in that it's the opposite of how we look at individuals and measure wealth.  But businesses are valued for the most part on their ability to generate cash, not on accumulated past earnings.  AZO generates a lot of cash where they collect ""today"" and they don't have large demands for cash put on them unexpectedly.-- Like an insurance company or something could have and therefore needs a lot of reserves.  They extend little credit and have favorable terms with respect to their accounts payable.  If you strip out ""goodwill and intangibles"" there are all sorts of companies that probably wouldn't give you much more than 10 cents on the dollar if they ""liquidated"".  I wouldn't sleep any better knowing I would receive a dime on the dollar as opposed to receiving nothing.  As an aside, AZO may actually have positive equity that isn't represented by the balance sheet.  I would imagine they carry their owned real estate ""at cost"" and don't mark to market the price.  So the store in a prime location paid for in 1990s dollars is still carried on the books today at 1990s dollars.  I could be wrong on that but it would seem like a lot of effort and money to have yearly appraisals done on all those owned locations and they probably aren't required to by GAAP.  The arguments on whether they are able to compete effectively are far better arguments than the fact they show a negative equity.",
"Loved your article.  Tried shorting AZO at $400 and then it went to $800.  :)  However, I could not agree with you more.  The executives at AZO are certainly using financial shenanigans and if they had to ever liquidate, the stock holders would not get a dime.  I also welcome the online sellers, creating competition and lowering costs for the consumer.  I just had a power steering rack and pinion replaced and the part cost me approx $170 from amazon and my local Toyota dealership was going to charge me almost $450's.  Check out the savings!",

Winter has been harsh which is actually good in their business , their tax rate will go from 35% to 21%, they have easy comps over last year and the PESO has strengthened relative to the dollar which will also help with comps YOY.  They can shut off share repurchases if they needed to hold more cash or retire maturing debt if they can't refinance it at attractive rates.  I actually see their lower percent commercial sales in a positive light as it seems they have an opportunity to take some market share.  They continue adding stores in Mexico which seems like a good market for them.  If you've ever been in the stores they are not underinvested in.  They are loaded with inventory and plenty of help at the counter.  It's not like walking into a Sears or K-mart or something....",
I think you miss the point. AZO is all about FCF. Last quarter they had 565 mio $ net cash provided by operating activities vs. 39 mio $ interest expense. Even if you double or threefold the interest expenses this is not a problem. Regarding the accounts payable - they are able to sell their parts to their customers before they have to pay for it - sounds great to me. Whtas wrong with this?,
"funny that you mention recessions - you missed a very basic metric please look at comp store sales (or total if you prefer) during the worst recession(s) - they skyrocket as people hold on to their older cars and shun the new car purchase during the last recession this went on for 24+ months....some of your research is valid, not the recession analysis",
"The online threat has been around for a long time with Rock Auto.  In general, I would guess most of the DIY market is in more rural areas.  Alternatively, auto parts stores in urban areas are likely to sell a higher mix to repair shops.  Rural customers are expensive to reach due to ""last mile"" logistics, and repair shop sales are essentially on-demand. If Amazon can create an on-demand delivery service (<30 minutes) to repair shops, then I will be concerned, because this is essentially what AutoZone, O'Reilly, and Advance Auto Parts cater to.There is also a perceived threat that electric vehicles will have far fewer moving parts and less maintenance will be DIY.  This threat obviously depends on the EV adoption rate.",

"I agree with you. Margins at AZO are not low enough to defend their retail store business. Add all the debt and corresponding debt payments, and at some point, when margins are forced lower, debt cannot be serviced. This is a huge risk. It occurred to me when AZO started selling nylon rivets in two packs. I had to go online to get a twenty pack from an alternative source. The online twenty pack sold for the price of 2 two packs.Worse still, AZO online cannot compete against AZO in-store. The insurance industry had this issue for many years, until most insurance agents disappeared. Now, most everyone buys insurance online.",5 Reasons AutoZone May Make An Amazing Short

"Hi DoctoRx, great article again :)I did notice management exercised their options and keep them or only sold a very small amount. (unlike most of other companies, just exercise and sell all of them). But generally i don't pay attention to this. I don't even pay attention to EPS. In biotech, I only check 1 number that is revenue. It's a very high margin business. Revenue*(0.85~0.95) = gross profit. They can decide to put how much money back into R&D, so even EPS is not a good measure here.Anyway 2 of my 3 core holdings(REGN CELG BGNE) are out of favor atm. BGNE was top performer last year. Investors question about REGN's commercial ability just because PSCK9 was a big failure. So no matter how many good products in REGN's pipeline, lot of investors will just say ""well, they can't sell""Investors question about CELG's R&D ability just because there were some recent failures in pipeline. So CELG still have a gigantic pipeline but lot of investors will just say ""well, most of them will fail, they can't replace Lenalidomide's revenue in the future""I really think it's just bias.

Dayrates have been stable at low levels for a while. In fact, the North Sea has even seen some price inflation as of late.6)Deepwater remains the most oversupplied space with the least demand.

"TSLA is a cult stock.  It has to be because on any other traditional methods of valuation, TSLA is a dead duck.  Companies cannot survive w/o demonstrating the ability to generate Profits.  Overwhelming Debt cripples the ability to generate Profits.  Even Cult stocks become subject to fundamental analysis (even by analysts/newletter writers, and pundits that claim they use Technical Analysis exclusively).  Over 35 years, I've used both and believe that depending on an investor's criteria at a point in time, TA supplements FA.  Both can lead to success or mitigate mistakes to a degree.When it comes to TSLA, I don't care whether FA or TA or FA/TA together is utilized; TSLA is on life support.  Cult stocks are Momentum stocks and stock market history is full of what happens to momentum stocks when the winds of change occur.  The damage is catastrophic, especially for investor's using Margin.  TSLA is a wreck waiting to happen, IMO.Pundits on television, in Magazines, or Newsletters do a dis-service to their listeners when these gurus recommend any shares w/o pointing out the good and bad in the Financial statements.

"At the time that the 300,000+ reservations were made, Tesla said they would try to start shipping by the end of 2017.  Many of us discussed in the forums that it was an aggressive timeline to finalize in June 2016 the design and start shipping by the end of the following year.  We thought at best they would ship a few hundred.  They accomplished what they promised. (Although Elon Musk and the crowd snickered at that promise since all previous vehicles had been late.)Exhibit A: http://bit.ly/2qMHHoGI don't care what Musk said in July 2017 about an accelerated timeline.  Too many us reservation holders we had planned to take possession of the car sometime in 2018.  Mostly, likely 2nd quarter (depending on where you lived in the US and your position in the reservation queue.  Some have leases on our current cars that don't expire until the 1st or 2nd quarter 2018 and it would be difficult to take the car earlier. I know I didn't want to take possession of the car in the Winter and if they still offer it to me I will delay it until late March or April.We don't care what your bull or bear opinions are. They are irrelevant.   When we put $1000 down we were told they were going to try to START shipping by the end of 2017 and they have done so.

"Let me tell you that there is only one thing Tesla is extremely good in. No it is not cars. They may be good, but not that good.  Actually Teslas are not very exciting at all, they look a lot like 1990´s Mazdas and drive ok but nothing exciting. But that doesnt matter, because for the people buying Teslas that does not really matter. Hey M3 buyers never saw the actual product but they bought it anyway! What makes that happen? Well that is the brilliant marketing of Tesla and especially Elon Musk! Yes, though Tesla does not seem to spend millions on it, Tesla is all about very carefully managed and brilliant marketing! We all know what best attracts people to buy your product: people standing in line for it. Those people in line are not that much attracted by the product, they are far more attracted by the line they have to stand in! How cool is that: I popped up some more or less serious money and I am in line for an expensive product.  I am part of the hype!Myself I don´t care for that BS but I know a few guys who have their Facebook loaded with M3 reservation talk. It even still seems very interesting to let people know you ordered autopilot, as most people do not seem to know this system only exists in Teslas pricelists. I even found out that some guys ordering the M3 did not know at all it will not have a dashboard with a speedometer in front of them. But telling them they dont care! So if you are looking at  the moment to short Tesla (as I do) you should be most interested in the best kept secret of Tesla: the transfer to order rate.

Missing the numbers just tells us Musk doesn't care about selling in volume in the short term, but rather he is focusing quality and a superior brand.  Tesla is a state of the art car.  It needs to be made 100% at the highest quality possible.  Once he gets it right, the volume will come later.  That is why Tesla will own 60 to 90% of the automarket worldwide.

(NASDAQ:EXEL) today announced an amendment to the protocol for the phase 1b trial of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ®) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The amendment adds four new expansion cohorts to the trial, which will now include patients with NSCLC and CRPC, in addition to previously included patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and urothelial carcinoma (UC). The primary objective in the expansion stage of this trial remains to determine the objective response rate in each cohort. New expansion cohorts include the following: patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or BRAF) who have not received prior therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor patients with NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration who have progressed following treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor patients with UC who have progressed following treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor patients with CRPC who have previously received enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate and experienced radiographic disease progression in soft tissue The original trial protocol included four expansion cohorts, which will remain in the amended study: patients with RCC with clear cell histology who have not had prior systemic anticancer therapy patients with UC who have progressed on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy patients with UC who are ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have not received prior systemic chemotherapy for inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic disease patients with UC who are eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have not received prior systemic chemotherapy for inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic disease “Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer or castration-resistant prostate cancer are in need of additional therapies that can slow disease progression,” said Gisela Schwab, M.D., President, Product Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer, Exelixis. “We are pleased to announce that this phase 1b trial will now include additional tumor types, as well as advanced kidney and bladder cancers.

I would think that lower unemployment rates; increasing wages and lower taxes would lead to a rise in discretionary income and consumer confidence that would result in increased auto sales and more willingness to subscribe to SIRIUSXM .,
Question. everyone seems to think siriusxm taxes will go down to 21% because of the new tax laws.  I don't think they were paying any taxes since they were using their NOLS. and when the NOLS run out then siriusxm will start paying corporate taxes at the 21% which is still better then 35%... but it is more then they are paying today with means once the NOLS run out they will have a tax increase.,

"Totally agree! Total dumpster. After they lost express script and lot of other PBM contracts they have resorted to cheap and utmost ridiculous tactics. One example our channel checks recently revealed, for most of the vitamins subscriptions they are filling them with little known company Sancillo Which was founded in 2005. These are priced above market price and in some cases above brand names rx vitamins. We assume these types of deals will give them short term high margins but in the longer run customers would get a wind of it and stop buying them or take their Business elsewhere. This is one example. Also there is open secret that everyone knows they sell stuff outrageous margin hoping their convenient locations will make the customers pay whatever they price it. Walgreens follows the same model. We question how sustainable is this business model. The recent years the prices have trended way above average compared to aay last 10 years. It was hard to find the data but we’ve got some data dump from now defunct price compare website. Retail sales are significant part of their revenues but we assume they are even significant contributors to bottom line net profits number. In age of Amazon shrinking shipping cycles and introducing pick up locations, they are right to think their retail business is at risk. And in some way they tried joining forces with Aetna to revolutionize healthcare thinking somehow they can leverage above sancillo deal model on a very large scale where minute clinic doctors write prescriptions enlarge these type of deals. But a model where your doctor is paid by pharmacy retailer - there is a motivation to write more prescription - it’s ethical and very thin grey line. We wonder how regulators handle this and how company responds. And to do this deal - it wrecks havoc with their balance sheet which is already showing cracks of retail weakness. There is lot to see in numbers as well as connecting all these dots. It’s one Monte Carlo Path out of many. But everything looks very shaky from here.",

"Based on normal operating conditions and company guidance, AKS is likely to report a multiple double-digit loss per share for Q4 2017.  Extraordinary items could surprise.  Forward guidance will be especially important since a Section 232 report is likely to be issued by Dept. of Commerce prior to their earnings release.  Investors should listen closely for clues about contract negotiations and pricing resets for 2018.",
Vlad - good update on AKS.  How much upside do you think remains in CLF given the recent run up?  Thx,
"I have been buying and selling this stock for years.  AKS will reach 9 to 10 USD before by Spring and should trade at least around 8 to 9 USD until end of June. Then the stock will fall back to 5 roughly.  Given the unique set of circumstances on the steel market which will likely drive the price of steel well over 700 next 3 months and 232 still out there. We could see AKS jump to 10+ quite quickly as steel supply will be tight until Spring.  In my book, now is time for Long positions at 8 strike and covered calls at 10 strike. make money every year with this stock. This year if 232 is add to the mix I will simply make more money than usual. Though when I say this I also assume that the stock was purchased at the right cost basis which should be closer to 5 USD mark.",AK Steel: Time To Sell After Rally?

"IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A CROHN's TREATMENT COST $40 PER SHARE RECENTLY?CELG, an obviously superior bio-tech much like Amgen, Biogen, and Gilead, all seem prone to surprise crashes in share prices as a result of a perceived decline in their future earnings. Unfortunately and unfairly, this can be tied to political decisions regarding the amount of payments that areas to be paid for, Ultra-High-Cost treatments that are Low Volume/Astronomically High-Value added products. I have tried my hand at all of the aforementioned, but leaving the speculation to Mining enterprises, I keep finding myself back with the holdings I have had for the past 30+ years. Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer. Johnson and Johnson being the better but less similar to Celgene of the two.This whole sector may be the stuff of legends, but one needs to really be on top of the company's current events and probable outcomes. I do the same kind of speculative things in the Energy sector, but in the Biotech sector I was just lucky to say that so far I haven't lost before exiting. Recently, I had shares in Marinus that was developing Galaxonone (may have misspelled). After, its first go round at Clinical Trials failed, the shares crashed. From like $6 to .82 cents. In this case I actually know what the drug was supposed to do and for whom. So I expected it to get ""Orphan Drug Status"" and a retrial. Meanwhile, at an average of under $1 I added a large # ( small $) via a ""FRIP"". All of a sudden, it went to ~$8! So I sold and turned the proceeds into MMM shares. Now, Marinus may ultimately be worth a fortune, or NOTHING! If a company like Celgene buys them out, the shareholders are very fortunate. If NOT --- well, .82 cents might be what you'd get a thousand shares for!So, this is a sector that requires insight and practically insider insights to come out ahead in because so much hangs in the balance of treatments that are subsidized, due to cost, and have competing firms trying to beat them to the finish line or a 'Biosimilar'.Anyway, sorry for the diatribe, but this is among the 5 best in a sector that makes almost every other form of investment appear simple.",Celgene: Impact Biomedicines To Broaden The Pipeline

"Retrospectively its easy to see all the mistakes.  Obviously, SDRL was overleveraged.  Had it simply paid a lower dividend it could have deleveraged and maybe been OK.   Even with the leverage, SDRL could have survived a less serious fall.  It also could have survived an oil price fall that was only 2 years long.  If oil had gotten back to $60-70 in 2016, instead of late last year, SDRL may have pulled this out.   Retrospectively (of course) there are things it could have done differently and survived had it done them immediately after the oil price cash.  EG, equity based deal when the stock was still trading in high teens.  Maybe asset sales when asset values were higher or aggressive maneuvers to lock rigs into contracts (ANY contracts) so it wouldn't have to stack any, etc.   But this is all Monday morning quarterbacking.   After five years of >$80/bbl oil, much of that WAY higher, if you had said in 2013 that oil was going to shortly hit $30 and trade at <$50bbl for most of three years, I don't think anyone would have believed you.  That's around when the contracting was done.",
Does anybody know what SDRL's debt/EBITDA or other metrics were back in 2014 when oil was over $100 ?What it was a few years later when oil prices crashed ?Just curious............. didn't realize SDRL had as much debt as it did.,

No other plan is going to leave anything for shareholders. Hard to say exactly what the chance of shareholders ending up with zero is, since its basically a guess at the likelihood of the current JF/H/C plan surviving intact.

They said ""Never Mind"" when I reminded them that if one rig failed, the revenue would be cut a whopping, disastrous 50%. My, how times have changed. Guilty and stupid for owning a bit of both ESV and SDRL as speculative plays in the day. Paid for that lesson, and it was one of the best I got. From then, only ""quality"" companies in my portfolio.

"Reading this thread, it comes to mind that like so many other things in modern society the mindset of investors has changed, those that used to think in terms of years now think in quarters, those that thought about quarters now are checking one week performance, and weekly traders are concerned about the drop between noon and 3 pm.I mention this because each of us has to decide if a specific holding is a buy and hold, or buy and accumulate, or a short term trade, etc.  MU is a huge global company that has been a trader's buy for decades, but now we are looking at a transition to what I view as more of an almost industrial/cyclical entity.  While the price movement over the past week might look like it's still a volatile trade, it's my opinion that is no longer the case, this is a buy and tuck into your long term portfolio holding and ignore the weekly noise.I am NOT a memory sector expert, nor a whiz of an investor, so please don't put too much weight in my ramblings!",

Earnings far away, good capital structure, solid portfolio, management that proved to maintain solid course and most of all every single day that passes (with or without this noise) is another day of solid income of MU. I know it is hard to watch your portfolio up and down so much but how else can you buy it for decent price?If it would be all roses and sweet prospects by everyone it would trade for normal multiple and there would be much less space for buying this. Thank Cramer, he makes you more money. Also thank no div strategy. Once/If they start to introduce div. it will invite different crowd with longer prospects and stabilize the stock price.

Yes, but so far only a couple of % points. NAND cost was down 17% last quarter, so NAND prices have to fall as much as that to have any impact, and MU continues to drop the cost of production. Margins still healthy and more of their product is moving to SSD's anyway where margins are better.So everything is going according to plan except 3DX, they're behind schedule but that's according to INTC's initial boasts.You obviously don't know this stock, its a traders dream, can't take the heat?

"I am long here 8,000 shares.  I feel that $MU is making progress to being less cyclical.  So here goes my spitballing of thoughts based on that. - If the above is true, then predictability of outlying quarters and years improves significantly.  Yet mgmt only predicts/provides estimates for 1 quarter at a time.   Hard for analyst and investors to get fully behind doing that, even though I am.   I know mgmt discusses trends expectations, but doesnt fully provide esp range for year, etc.  I think this should change.  I am sure they are doing 1 yr 3yr and 5r analysis that are dynamic sensitivity analysis.  Thus they must know expected cash needs, utilization of the cash, and next 12 months eps.  Transparency to the investing world would be a significant positive.- This greater predictable notion due to less cyclical nature, assuming mgmt truly believes, would give huge credence to a much higher stock price.  I believe when a company is under-valued by 25% or more then buybacks are warranted.  I also believe buybacks should be enacted ASAP, at least allowing for them (board approval).  Thus $MU can buy back when there is volatility as well as creating a floor so to speak.  Say $2B to start with over 18 months.  Again they dont have to buy back if price rises significantly, but would provide the opportunity to do so should it arise, like now.Both of these would provide value to the shareholders.",

BUT, MU guidance dec 19th for Q2 was upped to 2.51 to 2.65, analysts a month ago were at 1.88. Keep in mind Q2 is not generally the strongest quarter for MU, so unless prices collapse, the 2018 $9.78 EPS estimate might turn out to be conservativeIntel news NOT a THREAT to MUas of 9:30 AMShares of Micron Technology Inc. MU, -1.44% dropped 2.3% in morning trade Wednesday, to extend the 5.7% tumble on heavy volume in the previous session, amid concerns over the announcement earlier this week that the memory-chip company and Intel Corp. INTC, -0.96% were ending their 3D NAND memory development partnership. J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur reiterated his overweight rating on Micron, saying investor concerns that Intel was trying to move into China may be overblown. Sur said investors had asked if Intel could license its 3D NAND technology to start-up memory chip companies in China: ""While we do not know if Intel is indeed trying to license the technology, we believe Micron continues to have ownership rights to the developed technology for many years and any licensing agreement that Intel would enter into with a third party would have to be approved by Micron, and we believe Micron would be against doing such a deal."" Intel shares slipped 0.2% in morning trade. Over the past three months, Micron's stock was little changed, Intel shares have rallied 9.8%, the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, -1.52% has climbed 8.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.22% has gained 11%.",
"CRAMER - if you listen to the segment, the first thing he says: ""How about Micron, now I think this has real potential"" Why he would talk about MU in the same segment as pot and bitcoin is beyond me and totally irresponsable, but its because these are the top 3 questions on his twitter feed, there IS NO OTHER REASON except that the twits are thinking MU looks good to buy. Cramer is trying to ""guess"" that MU's markets ""may"" have peaked. Based on what? Because he's seen MU stock crash 3 times in his life when earnings were strong and PE low!! (same conpany as in 1995?)! Great research.His superficial (no surprise) understanding of MU's business and the sector and that somehow people don't realize that MU's products are going to suffer pricing declines sooner than anyone expects (including company, industry experts and veteran analysts who are all pointing out that MU is more insulated against fluctuations and they don't see any big clouds for a couple of years). Anyone who has made 200 or 300% can cash in and move on to the next party, DUH. This is nothing more than Christmas dinner chatter with uncle bob and aunt Irma. It's a warning for any investment, if you're up 50, 100 or 200% you should have trimmed your stake.If he's wrong he'll come back in 6 months and say ""we have confirmation that MU is not gonna get killed by commodity swings for years"", and if he's right, he'll say the opposite.",

Its hard to explain this other than no credibility on MU management and their statements etc. Cramer might be an illiterate person in this area (which I believe he is, he is there for rating, not being smart), but he is able to put MU next to pot and cryptocurrency (it sounds more like a joke), because it is going up and down like pot and cryptocurrency, not like a company who makes next wave tech and necessary chips for all things electronics, no need to mention cells, computers, servers,.... too strategic that US government didn't want China to even think about buying it out.

It seems that Cramer and me are the only ones who warn that MU at p/r of 5 is what it deserve . Surely it can quickly increased to 10 and even 20 when  nand and drams price will go down.,
"Let me try to add to the Knowledge others have given here.  Williams analysis was excellent and Electric Phred and others have contributed a lot on what is going on in the changing environment for memories.I spent 22 years in the semiconductor industry with Motorola when it was a powerhouse, #5, eventually becoming the general managers business analyst.  I had stints overseas, and as a financial analyst so I had a very detailed understanding of the business of manufacturing, R&D, and meeting customers needs.For the last 18 years I have traded stocks transitioning more to an investor.  The first two years after leaving Motorola investing and trading tech in the year 2000 mode made me a fortune and I never went back to work.Analyzing the Memory market was always tough and never has gotten much easier.  But analyzing what a good company should make is a little easier.Memory manufacturing is one of the most capital intensive businesses around.  In my days it took $3 of capital to produce an additional $1 of sales and I don’t think it has changed much.  And what you spend this year  produces sales usually for the next year.  Fabs are ridiculously expensive and other than the cost of the wafers all fixed costs.  So you have to run at a very high utilization level.  Good Memory production companies should command 20% to 25% return on assets to fund growth and a reasonable return to shareholders given the risks which are many.So how does MU stack up?This last quarter, non gaap earnings are running at $12M and the RONA asset base for quarter end is $32B (total assets minus long term investments minus current liabilities).That is close to a 40% return.  Now normalize for lets say 15% taxes and you are still at 34% RONA.Yes that is above historical rates and prices will normalize back to the 20% to 25% RONA range.  If it was normalized right now MU would be in the range of $6.4B to $8B earnings for an E.P.S.  Of $5.30 to 6.50 or so.Assign it a p.e. commensurate with the rest of the industry and you have a value of $70 to $90.  Even if you used RONA at 15% you get $50.  I think $70 is a fair valuation for this stock right now.MU is in an enviable position right now.  They are closing the gap on technology, have yield improvements that can be made in NAND that will offset price reductions for the next 2 quarters.  They are one of only 3 major and one minor manufacturer of DRAMs.  That allows flexibility in moving in and out of NAND to maximize returns when DRAM markets are very strong.  In my days, Drams went into P.C.s and were a pure commodity.  Now they have 3 or 4 major drivers and within those drivers many customers are looking for more custom solutions to optimize for their applications.  Custom products don’t have the price fluctuations that commodities do and more barriers to entry.Examine the other two big players in Drams.  Both Samsung and Hynix have announced they are adding capacity to meet customers needs.  The subtle message is we are happy with our market share.  Micron has essentially said the same.  An oligopoly situation.  Samsung seems to be sending a message that price increases are slowing but don’t expect big price reductions.  On the NAND side you have 5 or 6 players so there will be more price competition.  But unit growth rates for NAND are going to be very strong for the foreseeable future (2018 and 2019).On the negative side.  It is extremely hard to overcome people arguing from an historical perspective on memories.  There have been many boom busts and one only needs to examine micron’s financial history.The stock is a favorite of hedge fund and quant trading so expect extreme volatility.  Daytrade it on your own risk but there seems to be a context to move it 2% to 4% a day right now.  I personally watch pricing, demand, and measure how the stock is doing by their quarterly results and conference call and not by the rants and raves of hedgies and Cramer and to a large extent industry pundits that really don’t know crap.  I used to watch Motorola stock go down while we were having record quarters for growth.  All eventually recalibrates.  So be patient.",

"Commendable effort.  Thanks for the analytical perspective.  Ultimately unsatisfying, however.  Tech investing in this era is fraught with both sector specific and global uncertainties that will determine the outcome of any particular investment.  This is truly the age of seismic change, of disruption.  DCF just doesn't tell us much anymore because everything is changing so fast.   Assumptions about Micron and the semi-c memory industry have to start with purging the ""C"" word - commodity - from our vocabulary.  Yes, it has been a ""commodity"" in era of pc-dominated industry growth.  To call it a commodity today is to miss the point.  One might as well refer to blood as a commodity.  Yes, all ""commodities"" have their essential niche, but there is no niche in semiconductor memory and storage.  Lose your blood supply and you're dead.  Lose access to DRAM and NAND today and you're out of business.  The ""niche"" for these products is the world's economy.  Particularly in DRAM, 3 companies have a power that staggers the imagination.  The world's memory OEM's and the global economy in this AI, Big Data-driven secular gale we are in are like frogs that have been swimming in increasingly hotter water that find themselves unable to jump out of the pot.  They and we are all hostage to the decisions of these companies' now.The world has fundamentally changed. Everyone has to wake up to the fact that memory and storage are essential  to global economic life and their are only 3 companies that make this ""commodity""!  Meanwhile the investment community, thinking in mental paradigms about a pc-driven ""commodity"" memory era that has died - never to return! - is awarding MU a PE of 5 while the current market values the DOW on average above 20!   So yeah, it's all crazy complicated and there are so many contingent technical, operational, and global economic and political factors and this is a much longer conversation but let's leave it with this:  Micron's  stock price is a factor of many things but DCF is probably one of the smallest of them.",
"why is everyone worried about Cra Cra?  I think this company is just that: a company and not a commodity.  It may trade like one presently but indications from what I have read seem to indicate it is going to be much more stable from manipulative forces thus a much more steady price with less wild swings.  There will be some consolidation to achieve that stance.  I wish it could play out sooner as I hate to get rid of my shares, etc/.",
"Cramer's Twitter is lit up with people criticising him on his anti Micron views. No wonder the guy is angry.That goes to prove you right there that his ""advice"" isn't based on any sort of sound research. It is based purely on whatever he feels like saying every week with zero jusitification.",

Just when it looked like it was picking up steam, and everyone was raving that Nanya finally sold all his shares, the stock has been falling.  It almost reached $47 as an interday high several days ago, and it has simply been on a descent again, propped up partially by Monday's rally, only to fall while the NSDQ rallied all the way to the close.Those who seriously question whether it will continue an uptrend are simply criticized and dismissed.  Pump it as you wish, but to me this is only static and noise, and nobody knows if MU continues going up, or hits a ceiling and trades up and down and sideways.  Blame it on its volatility, but I view that as a catch-all excuse for when it drops.",

"Micron is hard to forecast past 2018.  ML, for instance, isn’t forecasting 2019 numbers just yet.  However, pretty much every analyst thinks Micron will have blow out numbers in 2018.

Even if revenue or profits disappoint, the stock is still easily worth $60/share.  But logic and markets often diverge.  Just look at Tesla going up $19 today.  Insane.",

"My assumption has been that the only reason there is a large interest in the product is because it prints a crypto currency that consumers think they can flip for a big profit.  I don't know what the assumed payback time is, but it's probably pretty quick at the current exchange rate.  However, if you exponentially increase the supply of the coins with all of the new hardware coming online then the speculative demand for the coins also has to increase exponentially to maintain the value.  With Chinese government interference that seems very unlikely and a collapse in the coin value and therefore interest in the device would happen reasonably soon, long before they would generate any really significant revenue to justify the billion dollar in market value gain.",

"This article offers a good starting point for discussion. It is clear that XNET will have a huge cloud capacity even if 15M devices are online. The question is how much of that capacity can be effectively utilized by customers or members. If they can find enough customers (such as companies in live streaming, game broadcasting, online games etc.), the business will surely worth a lot: the article is suggesting XNET could reach 5% of AWS' capacity or 20% of AKAM's capacity, which could mean a valuation of 20%*$11B (AKAM) to 5%*$200B (AWS), or $2-10B. In this way, all the cryptocurrency related value can be extra bonus to investors. On the other hand, hardware sales can be 15M*$70=$1B, and the company could have a profit of $300M here, and the author's valuation for hardware thus seems conservative.

"Good article.  That the political solution creates a windfall for the TBTF banks, at the expense of FF shareholders and home buyers should be no surprise to anyone living in today's good ole USA.  Reagan, Obama, Trump, Clinton ... doesn't matter, ""the men/women with the gold make the rules."" Everyone is obsessed with D.C. and political outcomes, yet the courts must have the last word.  At $2.00/sh, the commons have at least a 10x upside (likely much higher) upon a court victory and are thus right now looking like a good bet, since I assess the odds of a favorable legal outcome at significantly better than 10-1.

Anyone who bought to hold longer term likely did so long ago as the prices have been all over the place over the course of MANY YEARS.  There have been PLENTY of ""buying opportunities"" in F&F over the years.So.....the buying pool is SMALL and sitting back on its bids.  They also know anyone selling at this point has GIVEN UP and capitulated and when you're the potential buyer in the face of sellers' capitulation YOU AREN'T GOING TO BID MUCH or bid aggressively.Said another way...buyers at this time know ANY SALE is a fire sale/capitulation sale.

The GSE's are operating under an expansion model. All of the articles stirring fear I still say don't believe the hype.

"Really good article. One thing that I don't think is discussed now is that in the secondary mortgage market there is already competition set up with the GSE's. From a loan purchasing standpoint Fannie and Freddie are not the biggest buyers on the market because they can't compete from a pricing perspective with Wells, Chase, and a lot of aggregators on the market. Even now Morgan Stanley has rebooted their mortgage division (previously they worked through PHH) and Goldman has been one of the key purchasers of non-performing loan portfolios. All of the talk that the GSE's need competition, or spinning them off, or getting rid of them I still look at as just being talk. Many companies now are already putting together their own portfolio Products whether they be ""altqm"" loans, Jumbo loans, whatever. They are already selling them on the secondary mortgage market and have been increasing the number of these types of sales in the last year. Fannie and Freddie are still needed because they set the rules and groundwork for how the market will be played out, but they aren't the most aggressive on the block. The last few weeks we've seen the stock drop on the commons. For a short two week window we saw the PFD's rise and article after article say dump common, they'll be worthless, buy PFD's. Where previously it was about the commons. Now after a bloomberg article last week which held absolutely no new information get's published, people are dumping their commons like crazy. To me it's market manipulation because there is nothing new that has been published, nothing new to hang our hats on, and nothing new to really indicate directionally one way or another the direction that the government will go. Call me crazy, I purchased another 1000 shares of FMCC today. Which brings my total portfolio up to 10k in FNMA and 11k in FMCC. I didn't get into these with any sort of expectations of windfalls payed out or their pre-crisis price of $65 a share. I purchased because they are cheap, worth a ton, and they aren't going anywhere. Over the next few weeks, plans will be taking place, and we'll start to see a real frame work come out, but for now, let people panic, it's not a quick fix (even though it's something that has already fixed itself0, and it's about the long money here. FNMA shot up to $5 a share  last year when Mnuchin mentioned the words ""recap and release"", you don't think that when a legit plan is laid out showing that the GSE's aren't going anywhere that at a minimum, the stock won't get back to that price? And when it's listed again on the NASDAQ, again, it's going to rise and whether you own the Commons or the PFD's, you're going to make money.",
"Isn't this what got us in this mess to start with?  Competitive banks all prodding for sub par loans, going after the unqualified borrower by throwing money at them and then packaging the loans in private label mbs' with phony credit ratings and selling strips into the market with CDO behind them and betting on their failure?Sounds like corky wants more of the same banks making money and sticking it to the taxpayers?  When it was FandF that never failed, never needed bailout $$ and never were cash flow negative from operations throughout the past 10 years?Looks like we have the crooks all lining up to take their piece... too bad its not something else.No, i don't feel like commons will be blown up.  The value of a business or businesses that generate $20B a year in after tax dollars at a multiple of 12 is 2x rate of return is near $250B.  Sell that into the market, pay off the preferred at $40B par and split $210B to the common... would be around $105 a share.  I'll take that.",
"Glen,Why are you so surprised at them wanting to kill off F&F in its present form? Let's count the ways.......Aside from the blatant Insider Activity that Corker & Gang could profit from what appears to be their open position in shorting F&F common (& maybe jr. preferred), it provides an elegant way of satisfying the Fake Press mantra that F&F were in many ways responsible for the entire Financial Crisis. It also provides needed political cover for idiots like GWBush & Gang -- Geithner, Hank Paulson, Greenspan & Bernanke -- (someone needs to release GW's Harvard MBA grades since I can't believe anyone would give an MBA degree to someone so blatantly stupid/superficial about business), AND Obama & Gang who had the golden opportunity to fix F&F properly in '13/'14 only to blink when the realized the 'optics' wouldn't fit their political agenda. It would also provide cover for Obama's illegal shifting of illegal $$$$ to fund Obamacare -- something that would have collapsed far sooner and with less pain than it ultimately will. It also makes Crapo look somewhat knowledgeable given his unbelievable CSPAN coverage showing how he is blatantly part of the 'TBTF Banking Gang.'This is just the tip of the iceberg, we are not even talking about how F&F never needed the funds in the first place -- F&F were used by Hank Paulson and Geithner to keep Goldman, JPMorgan, BofA, Merrill, et al. BREATHING due to their Board's and Management's blatant malfeasance during the Financial Crisis. Crony capitalism at its finest and what could still be an arrow to the heart of our Republic if allowed to be covered up. F&F's demise would also provide cover for Buffet's power grab and his last hurrah b4 he is placed six feet under. He can't go there soon enough IMO. There are so many more examples of crony capitalism, malfeasance, outright lies and deceit I can't list them all. Maybe because I have served on an HOA Board where I have seen on a microcosm of what is happening today on how strong personalities, malfeasance, secrecy, and combativeness can all form a toxic brew of unfairness, and outright cancerous outcomes. The politics, personalities, 'optics', here are greater here by a factor of 1,000,000x.......I am shocked.....shocked I tell you.....to find gambling in this establishment!All JMHO.

"First time commenting. Discouraging price action after an important improvement and what felt like and improved 'environment' for GSE reform, until last week.I was split 50/50 between common/pref since Nov 17 but that spread has obviously widened on its own. Wondering like everyone else if Ackman is unloading, that sure would be a departure from his usual strident self.  We were/are kidding ourselves if we thought the long knives wouldn't come out one last time, with authority now in UST hands, all but politically. I did email my Senator yesterday, Warren, who is on the banking committee. Despite what you may think she isn't at all inclined to murder the GSE's and hand their business over to institutions she loathes a lot more. I didn't unload, there's no point in engaging in a dialogue like that. Just encouraged her to label them SIFI's,  limit them to one function, charge them a fee, and capitalize them appropriately.  Maybe there is some room with the other members who will vote on this...  The losses are tough but you had to understand that. Ackman could be wrong about his position, but he is right that they trade like options, and you have to understand that when looking at the volatility.   Mnuchin's quiet has an obvious answer, it is in his favor to let them try and fail. I don't see him signing off on a solution to his professional pet issue that effectively turns his modus operandi and worldview on it's head. Getting all republicans and enough democratic support to ward off a filibuster is still just as tall an order today.

"Think about it: Corker would transfer the enormous profitability of the existing GSEs to the TBTF banks whose billions of garbage loans were stuffed into the GSEs by Paulson and Geithner rendering them temporarily insolvent.  So the TBTF banks in effect transferred their risk to the taxpayer. Corker blames the GSEs solely for placing the taxpayer at risk and wants to make sure that cannot happen again by killing the GSEs and awarding the TBTF banks with their marketplace functions. Placing future trillions of mortgage loans in the hands of TBTF banks does not remove risk to the taxpayer if Uncle Sam is going to bail out the TBTF banks in the next mortgage meltdown, and you know they will if necessary. There is a ton of irony in this: the culprits end up getting rewarded!One might argue that another bail out will not be necessary because of the controls and protections that will be in place. OK, so same for the GSEs now because except for the capital cushion, those controls and protections are in place now. Corker seems to be intent upon enriching those lobbying him the hardest. And he doesn't think anybody can see through this.",

"I would be careful adding to MDGL here. Looking at their exclusion criteria for MGL-3196 shows that they were MUCH stricter in patient selection. They excluded any patients w/ even a remote possibility of increased chance of liver injury. Adverse effects will be revealed when MGL-3196 is tested w/ larger sample sizes. Likewise, VK2809 was significantly more efficacious in lowering lipids; meaning even at lower doses it should prove to be just as efficacious as MGL-3196 (and its ""dirty laundry"" is already out there). Moreover, as a previous poster mentioned, VKTX has another blockbuster candidate. At roughly 1/10th the value, it remains undervalued. As I wrote in previous articles, even if VK2809 was completely out of the picture, VKTX is undervalued considering VK5211's potential to radically change the landscape of osteoporotic treatments, and its other candidates for X-ALD and DMT2.

A comment on one point though:>""Then there is the decision to open up orders to the Northeast in the middle of winter with several feet of snow on the ground and no AWD option yet. I find this to be absolutely baffling. Kind of like trying to sell raincoats in the desert in July.""I don't' know your experience, but I've lived a good part of my life in the coldest/heaviest snow & ice parts of the country. It's a common misunderstanding among people that don't that AWD is mandatory in this climate.  What is far more important is swapping to a good set of snow tires each winter season.  Do that, and AWD only becomes important for getting out of a few edge cases of getting stuck, or for fast acceleration in bad conditions (which most of the time is a stupid idea anyway).",

"A number of folk here seem to think that their investment as longs is secure.  That is not the way that the markets operate.Yesterday, Go Pro's shares dropped 30% before rising slightly before the close to just above $6.  This is a company whose shares were once selling at $85.Despite manufacturing a range of world-leading electronic devices, they have been left behind.  Their CEO's package has dropped to one single dollar, $1, from $2M. There is a possible parallel between Tesla and Go Pro.  Both operate in rapidly developing technological markets.  Both had (have?) fiercely faithful customers.  Some longs repeat at every step on the journey their faith in Elon Musk, supporting this faith on personal conviction, rather than demonstrable facts and analysis.If there is one message that novice investors must learn, it is that they must keep assessing the risks of their investment against the anticipated rewards.  This requires actual numbers on the page, research and brutal honesty.My own assessment is that I am happy not to be long because of the much-discussed risk of reduction in value of my investment should the market collapse by, say, 30% as per Go Pro.On the other hand, the risks attached to shorting Tesla, at any recent price, exceed my appetite for risk.  This is despite my being absolutely certain that Tesla's business model is fatally flawed - the final chapter will be written, but when?  2018?  2019?  Who really knows what surprises lie ahead for this cash-strapped corporation? I simply cannot correlate what I see in the business performance with the stock prices over the period I have been interested.  Tesla's market is, to me, both volatile and irrational.

"I think the 4. Quarter result in terms of free cash flow will not be as bad as in the 3. Quarter because tesla reduced its inventory sharply since it delivered more than produced. Net income will still be quite bad due to heavy discounting of model S and X. Actually it does not matter so much in the long run. If tesla wants to make money it has to invest heavily in new production facilities, a dealer network which they decided to better own, but this also cost a lot. If one stick to the real numbers , tesla stock should decline heavily into the double digits and my guess is it will eventually. This is almost the same situation as in 2000, at that time lucent technologies, worldcom and many others showed nice growth and growth expectations which never materialized.

So far, no.",

I'm not even sure if all of them have been invited, because I do see posts on the boards from CA owners who have no invite to configure yet and are plaintively wondering if they have been forgotten. The short-range batteries aren't in production yet, but I am sure Tesla has minimum 3/4 months of LR customer orders on the LR/PUP version in the US, and after that Tesla can open up ordering on the LR/non PUP version if it wishes, plus fill non-owner reservations. Obviously keeping production as simple as possible is paramount for now to move product. They have demand. Yes, eventually you are right, but I don't think it will matter one bit in the first half of 2018.I believe ordering is opening outside of CA for prior owners who ordered on 3/31 because Tesla has weeks and weeks to ship those cars to the owners before the end of Q1.

Then Fremont can increase the proportion of SR versions in the production mix.",
I actually agree with the main premise of Donn's article which is rare.  I think many prospective owners are waiting on the AWD option for winter driving and performance reasons so hopefully they will release that soon.  I actually think a majority of people will opt for the larger battery though.  Its an expensive option but just provides more options as the charging network grows.,

"Barron's writes up another contact-based chargerhttp://bit.ly/2FQyhfjTECH TRADER DAILY Wireless Power: Fli Charge Branches OutBy:  Tiernan Ray Updated Jan. 18, 2018 12:12 p.m. ET'As I wrote several times last week, various forms of wireless power were on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, methods of juicing a gadget without using cables.The main contender, of course, is the technology that has become the standard bearer, Qi. That technology powers Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone X, as well as most models these days of Android-based phones.There were also competing initiatives, such as the highly controversial efforts of startup Energous (WATT) to make into a reality the sending of power via radio waves.And then there are the innovations of the magnetic resonance crowd, which includes startup WiTricity, and its chip provider, Efficient Power Conversion, which I talked about a bit last week.Yet another effort, also by a startup, is shipping product today and hasn't gotten its due. Fli Charge is a form of magnetic conductance, where the gadget to be charged is hooked to a dongle that in turn sits on a metal charging plate, called the “FLIway.""You can place these dongles anywhere on the FLIway, making it fairly flexible. The whole thing is lightweight and uses just one connecting wire for power back to the AC jack, streamlining the whole mess of cables.I've been using the FLIway all the time, at home and at work, since I first profiled the startup back in February of last year. I take the charging plate with me on trips, as I did last week in Vegas.

Lets start with Lie #1- 'WATT has devised technology to wirelessly charge devices at up to 15 feet.'You seem to have them confused with PowerCast. WATT is struggling to find an application for their so-called mid-field transmitter which is currently transmitting tiny amounts of juice up to 7 inches.,
"Having worked for a premier chip manufacturer (Qualcomm) I will tell you it's not at all unusual for new chips and devices to be demonstrated at CES in private meetings due to the nature of integration which could disclose confidential design information. This is a component- not a device. If you need a demo go look at a big TV, Technology comments here sound more like more of the same type of comments short sellers put out the week of the FCC approval. If I were to advise on stock pricing - I would do what Qualcomm did back when they fought the uphill battle to introduce digital technology to a reluctant marketplace and split stock several times to kill short sellers in advance. Still in all - the stock will perform within 6-12 months on its sales. It's easy to knock what hasn't occurred. Are you naysayers still carrying the old brick analog phones?",

"Meanwhile, Nissan has sold LEAF #300,000: http://bit.ly/2qKT8gD",
"I was taking notes at today's meeting with a car (truck) wiring harness factory manager. The questions were about EV manufacturing, aaand what a surprise Tesla popped up, and how ramping up their production is working. -Tesla has built their two Model 3 production lines for 10000 cars per week total capacity. If they started on 1st of January with 1000 cars/week and keep adding 130-140 every week which is 5 cars per production line per day that can sound a lot, but it's not. You see, they are just speeding up from slow-mo, not figuring out how to go faster from a base speed. They will reach 2500/wk in 13 weeks and 5000/wk after 32 weeks if it was linear growth. It's always more like an S curve though, so at some point, there will be a major jump in production speed.Then there were questions about the battery pack manufacturing. -Many people seem to think there are only 2 production lines and they have four stages and when one stage doesn't function production is very slow. That's not the whole picture. First you will have one or two production lines and you make them work. Then you start multiplying sections according to where the bottlenecks are to gain speed. You will probably end up with 1000 cell lines, 200 battery module lines, 10 battery pack assembly lines and 3 lines for shipping. Major improvement in manufacturing speed will happen when you have figured out the first complete production line and start multiplying them.You might think what a wiring harness guy knows about car manufacturing, well, he used to be a car factory production manager for the First Auto Works Group (VW, GM, Toyota brands in China) which is one the biggest car manufacturers in the world. He, of course, did not know all the details about Tesla factories but knew enough about manufacturing in general. What a crash course in car manufacturing. No wonder there haven't been new car brands in EU and USA for decades, quite the opposite, every couple of years one brand has disappeared. Starting a car company is such a nightmare why would anybody even try. You really need to have something special to offer, not only cars but a whole new way of thinking the transportation and be the first. Tesla is in a good position but in no way a clear winner, at least yet. I'm happy I don't have any money invested in Tesla, which might also be my big loss, but that's life.",

That is different than saying Tesla actually produced 1,000 Model 3's in the last week of December.  Producing at a rate of 1,000 a week could mean Tesla waited to completed a bunch of almost finished cars on the last work day in December, say 200 on that last day.  If we assume a five day work week (it could be six) would get you to 1,000 a week.Also, if Tesla actually produced 1,000 in the last week in December, that would mean that they produced only around 500 for the rest of December, a lousy number.I'd say we need to wait for full production numbers for January to see the true increase in Tesla production rates.",

Elon must have announced the space elevator or his own cryptocurrency.Even if demand is great, and even if Tesla WAS able to produce enough cars to meet demand, and if they could do so profitably, then, and only then, the stock might be worth a couple hundred bucks a share. Tesla is a long ways away from 2 of those 3. By the time it reaches 3/3, their debt will have mushroomed (like an atomic bomb) to more than 40 or 50 billion.Because of where Tesla stands now, with its current debt load, it will NEVER be able to grow into it’s current surreal valuation.  The stock price is not the same as book price - it is an artificial, cult inflated price.  Remember, they are cash flow negative, so they need external sources of funds to pay the bills.  When they eventually reach the point that they cannot service their interest payments, they will be technically bankrupt.  Their only hope is if they continue to get capital raises.  Tesla’s balance sheet is so ungodly awful, that it is starting to make those capital raises look increasingly unlikely.",
Bolt?  No such car.  VOLTJust sayin',
Tesla's total valuation is based on success of the model 3. It has been proven they can't make money on just the S and X. If I the business without the 3 is zero and I believe the authors analysis the total valuation for Tesla should be 6 Bn. Which is more than Jim Chanos thinks it is.,

"let us look at some of your logic, from your article:1,000 cars per week at $45,000 per car will generate revenue of around $180 million per month. If I make some very rough guesses that the Model 3 and it's successors production line and tooling will last for 15 years, allowing for 5.22% effective interest and a $0 future value of the assembly line, we can guess that the Gross Present Value of the market cap based on sum of parts accounting for Model 3 additions with a gross profit of 25% * $180M sales revenue would be around $6 Billion.Well, if Tesla does $180 million revenue per month (as per your article) and does do 25% profit margin (suspect, but let us go with your article) then you are looking at $45 million/month profit or $500 million/year.  Note:  this is not the around $6 billion.  You added a zero some whereNow, note that Tesla has a current negative cash flow of a $1 billion/quarter.  So, $500 million is about 12% of what Tesla actually needs.  But, Tesla is a religion.  Who cares about math",

So there's rumors that production is ramping up(still well below the volumes they said would be reached by last quarter). Are they sold? Delivered? Problem free? Anyone expect positive EPS for 4Q 2017? A positive % surprise?My guess, merely from track-record, as an occasional observer with this garbage farce of a company and pit for my tax dollars, is they will have a loss of between $2 and $3/share, and a % surprise of minus 5% or worse.

And especially when they are viewed as the leader, with a sustainable moat.I think that's what you're highlighting here, and that this is exactly what is happening with TSLA ... and has happened with AMZN, NFLX, and others.  Those that don't see this analogy don't understand how TSLA is valued in the marketplace.Revenue from Model 3 sales is what TSLA is all about these days as far as valuation is concerned.

"Many of your concerns are valid, and vexing for my clients. I have spent a fair amount of time and intellectual capital helping some very large and smaller tech and biotech companies traverse the issue of IP ownership, control, remuneration, and predictable ""rules of the road"". It takes patience, tenacity, a significant amount of creativity, but the impediments can be successfully overcome. Having some history and relationship with government and party officials can help open doors. However, it is a very unequal negotiating environment to match a sovereign nation against a public or private company. Additionally, motivations are disproportionate. With few exceptions, most companies need access to the China market more than China wants them. Their government and regulators are very adept at playing one company against another, to obtain maximal concessions. Until recently the US government has acknowledged the problem, but been reluctant to actively help. The prospect of the US reciprocally applying the same rules and requirements to Chinese based companies that China enforces on foreign firms could be a potent negotiating balancer. China has some requirements that are inviolate. #1 is maintenance of social stability, read this controlling any irredentist movements, or party threatening dissent. EG: Greater independence for Tibet, ethnic Uyghur's in Xinjiang province, Taiwan, or any group seeking autonomy. Controlling social media is paramount. That is why GOOGL, FB, NFLX and others are not welcome unless they totally submit to government regulation. #2 security...software and code embedded in products that are networked or used in vital infrastructure. Foreign cars,trucks, and public transport products are permissible until they are self driving and networked with each other. The party and state security apparatus aspire to track movements of the population. They also view artificial or enhanced intelligence as a powerful tool to monitor threats to social stability. Promoting indigenous Chinese technology and products are a high priority, but there is some room for creative legal negotiating. China will be the first major economy to allow fully autonomous driving vehicles.",

$1000,Nvidia: Where Can This Thing Go?
So what is Omer worth now?,
If you believe that OMS721 has a 50% shot at approval then bet your boots as the pay back odds are enormous.The fact that the price is stable tells you that the inside money doesn't believe in approval,
"Phase 3 companies are valued at potential 1-1.5X peak sale. I got this number by looking at GBT, GLYC etc.Even Omidria value is ZERO, this is still undervalued comparing to other Phase 3 peers.",
"We are net short OMER at the moment.  However, we were net long OMER before we did our research on the reimbursement issue.  I am on this site, like many of us, to learn and share insights.  I hope to read and sometimes discuss to help gain conviction in my thoughts and understand what the other side to my thinking might be.  I have no pride.  If I am wrong, I want to know that I am wrong--but I want to know what specifically makes me wrong.    I think that most can agree that Omidria's revenues are more than just a side show.   Consensus estimates have Omidria as the bulk of Omeros' revenues through 2022.  I think there is a significant difference between sowing worry, and trying to figure out what the company's revenues will be.  I don't know how to value anything without having a view on   the revenues.",
"Studies from BIO show that for all diseases/modalities, the probability for success from Phase 3 to Approval is 49%",
70% chance of success for drug in Phase 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I don't believe it - nor should you,
"Good article ! Enjoyed reading it. I agree with the author and the comments as well. Irrespective of the pricing, OMER is a good long term bet (not sure short term) !!aHUS phase 3 trial results will turn the tide for OMER. Untill then, it will be manipulated by shorts and analysts (like Adam). Just my thoughts...Happy investing !! Long OMER",
So much for the 400 per share some peeps talk about,
"The average discount rate for a drug that loses passthrough- if it's branded and single source like Omidria- is 20%. The question is how much it's going to make up through increase in volume? Also, how much due to increase in market uptake as eye surgeons will increasingly use Omidria?",
"""In IgAN, the prevalence rate is once again 0.0001%""I don't get this.Let's take 100k patients (US only). Prevalence rate: 0,03125%.Or we can use this numbers: "" A systematic review of biopsy-based studies spanning multiple countries suggests an overall population incidence of at least 2.5 per 100,000. Only one study in this review was from Japan, and most were from Europe and North America""Using this source, prevalence is 0,0025%.I don't understand how you assume 0,0001.",
I would think at the end of the article they would be long OMER not ALXN,
"ALXN  is down 2,83% at present with volume above 1.570,490Will see if it will be able to hold support at  the 118 level or it will come down to 115.Some Biotec stocks performing well today are:APHB, GALT, TRPX, NVRO, CTIC, AGEN, and a few others.:-)",
"I see this article was published today, but when was it written?  You mention heading into the last 2 weeks of the year--which was 3 weeks ago.  Since then their pass through reimbursement status has expired.  The assumptions in your valuation seem arbitrary.  I would assume that a 40% reduction in Omidria's price is not conservative at all.  Doctors that were reimbursed through Medicare actually got paid 6% of list price to use the drug.  What would you be willing to pay for something you used to get paid for?  60% of list price?  That seems aggressive.  It's like saying, where would you choose to eat if Omeros paid for your dinner plus gave you the tip, vs. where you would eat if you were paying.  If I was getting the tip--I'd choose an expensive steakhouse and order the best wine.  If I was paying out of my own profit, it'd be a totally different story.  Secondly 10% discount rate is wildly conservative.  The interest rate on their debt alone is 11.5%.  Their blended cost of capital would be considerably higher than that.  Omeros' discount rate is not equal to the industry discount rate which includes large cap biotech.  This is a very risky company.  It is a company whose sole revenue source just lost reimbursement + a pipeline drug in phase 2/3.  AMGN has a 10% discount rate, not OMER.  Any company would look great if you discounted risky rewards at safe risk rates.",
I see the correction.  Thanks for taking the time to thoroughly analyze a company for which I also consider Mr. Market's discount rate to be too high relative to the company's prospects.,
"I like this forecast, rather conservative. I agree with the above commenter that, at this time, a drug coming ""under the scanner"" does not necessarily mean a deep discount, although I agree it could very well happen in European markets where social healthcare systems have more leverage.That said, I don't think you'll run into any trouble if your forecast proves too conservative. Good analysis!",
"If ACP truly does think so highly of Omeros, and if ACP truly does think Alexion's Soliris will come under increasing scrutiny (not to mention potential competition from OMS 721), then why does the disclosure section above list ACP as long Alexion and not long Omeros?",
"""Alexion’s (ALXN) Soliris is priced between $550,000 and $750,000. For OMS 721 though we have assumed a significantly lower price of $150,000 in the U.S. and even lower at $125,000 in Europe. The reason being Soliris has come under the scanner from lawmakers on both side of the Atlantic for the pricing of Soliris.""I don't think your reason warrants OMER to price their drug at 1/4 the cost of Soliris just because ALXN ""has come under the scanner"".",Omeros Corporation: A Valuation
"Answering my own question (above) after finding an answer on arstechnica.com (https://tinyurl.com/ya...). Here's what they had to say about the sparc chip's immunity from the spectre and meltdown cpu threats:""Some platforms, such as SPARC and IBM's S390, are immune to the problem, as their processor memory management doesn't need the split address space and shared kernel page tables; operating systems on those platforms have always isolated their kernel page tables from user mode ones.""This might provide a positive boost for Oracle's cloud in the long term, since security is a primary concern for enterprises operating on the cloud.",

"Bottom line: ORCL has no chance to catch AWS or Azure in the Cloud. Why not? Because ORCL wants to own the stack, top to bottom. It wants to run its DBs, runs it own major apps (some small partners apps are ok but that's all). wants to run its own analytics/BI, etc. The business model is not open to other major software providers.AWS is open to all software providers. Even Microsoft, which sells competing software products say in the ERP space, has Azure open to all software providers.ORCL's strategy has always been and remains lock-in. When the day comes when SAP's S/4HANA is actively supported on Oracle Cloud, then you could consider Oracle Cloud a serious threat to AWS and Azure. Even then, only maybe. These changes take time.Finally, AWS and Microsoft are deeply committed to research to innovate cloud services. Google too. You will simply not find the same level of commitment from Oracle, who has invested far less on research/innovation since they shifted to a portfolio (acquisition) based business model about a dozen years ago versus the ""build it here"" vendor they were pre-2000.If all you do with ORCL is crunch numbers you miss the bigger strategic picture. They have NOT shifted to the AWS, Azure, Google model of cloud services and research. And they will never make that difficult cultural change with the current executives.",Oracle Ready To Battle Amazon AWS
"Love Hurco, love your analysis, but I really hate where the market is right now. Global debt is too crazy and we are at the peak of the business cycle in my opinion. I am selling my position",
"Thanks for another good overview of Hurco. You seem to be the closest thing we have to an analyst for Hurco. I asked them about doing a conference call at the annual meeting a couple years ago, but they said they didn't have enough analyst following them to justify it.

Their effective tax rate for 2015 was 31%, 2016 was 30% and 2017 was 27%.

I understand some of what is going on, in terms of percentages of these costs AABA would assume in tandem with VZ.  Still, I don't know to what extent these potential costs will actually play out and also what hedges AABA might have in place to reduce damage to the company's bottom line.

typo alertAphria (OTCQB:APHQF) (APH.TO)Aurora is the third largest publicly...,
"Given the rapid expansion in growing space space currently underway, any attempt to value the major players must take future growing space, as well as the type of space, into account. For example, while Aurora production may currently rely 100% on indoor space, that is about to change dramatically as phase I of Aurora Sky (as well as the H2 Biopharma aquisition) come online.Also, while costs based on medical sales are appropriate for producers who will remain only in the medical space, recreation sales will not only change cost structures, but also impact revenues. Recreational producers will not be selling and distributing directly to consumers, they'll be selling to distributors. Nor will they be realizing the same prices. In short, while existing costs of production and revenues may apply to a mature, established industry, the playing field in the 2nd half of 2018 will not reflect the current situation.

"Author:My agenda is clear. I believe the AM sector offers significantly higher revenue growth and a very high gross margin potential compared to most technology companies. So yes, DDD is in the neighborhood, but the best house on the block belongs to voxeljet. And yes it may be smaller in size, but it sits in the best location - product portfolio / markets served and global operations in key growth markets.I have many posts as to why that may be case, and although the company does not fit your profile of a value play, it certainly has a much better risk/ reward profile than DDD and for that matter any other player in the AM sector. We are taking about 30% growth with a GM of 45%.So if anyone is interested in a speculative area like AM, then go with the company in that sector with a consistently well articulated and executed strategy like VJET.",

"Interesting read. I struggle with describing the DDD chart as ""cyclical"", because that $90 run-up was pure speculative mania.  In that period 3D printing was BitCoin, not GE.At a forward P/E of 47 I struggle with describing it as ""value"" too.  The company is still very much a growth story, which is fair enough, because they are one of the front-runners in a technology that clearly has a central role in the future of manufacturing.  Recent very important news for the tech includes Airbus deciding to use 3Dp plastic parts for large mass-produced cowlings on airliner engines, as well as 3Dp titanium brackets.  That latter in particular is a pretty big deal, because titanium is very hard to work using traditional methods, and the aerospace primes are extremely conservative about potential safety issues.  If printed parts are truly as dependable as formed/cast/welded parts, they can be made much faster and cheaper (and even lighter!)- http://bit.ly/2qCAp6I- http://bit.ly/2Fi4tYHNow one thing you'll notice about those two examples - Neither is about DDD!  (Stratasys and Arconic, the specialty metals spinoff from Alcoa).  Keep in mind that DDD is a big player in 3Dp, but I wouldn't call them ""the industry leader"".  SSYS is the gold standard (some would debate that point), with big multinationals like Arconic and HP threatening to drop a competitive bomb on the industry and crush the early players.DDD has been hampered for years by a strategy of trying to be jacks of all trades in additive manufacturing but masters of none (buying a variety of different specialists), while others like VJET are much more focused.  In particular DDD staked a lot on their personal 3Dp line, and it flopped hard.  (Too soon?)Being in the aerospace manufacturing industry myself I love the future for 3Dp (we have a big plastic printer, and just in the past year started sourcing metal parts for prototypes from a 3Dp supplier), but I'm not as positive on DDD in particular.  The industry is still pretty speculative, and in an upcoming general market sell-off I would expect these names to lose more than average.  *Then* it will be the time to buy in... But maybe not with DDD.  (Then again maybe it is exactly the right one to bottom-fish with, since it is the most volatile.)Best of luck with your trades!",

"All these multi-billion dollar market cap penny stocks with a marijuana angle but no clear path to profitability will be bankrupt or making razor thin profit margins five years from now.

Newsflash: this industry will disintegrate into a commodity business with razor thin margins.The safest bet among marijuana stocks is The Hydropothecary Corporation (the only Quebec based marijuana stock/company with a market cap Around $450 million). It trades as THCX.v on the venture exchange in Canada and as HYYDF over the counter in America.In short, benefiting from a lack of home based competition and benefiting from Quebec's lowest electricity rates in the country... The Hydropothecary's path to profitability is clear. They will make Quebec their fiefdom, become the lowest cost producer and go on to dominate the market.

To make local, national, and international distribution down the road a bit easier, The Hydropothecary corporation has invited a member of the board of directors of a $37 Billion market cap, 12,000 store Quebec based convenience store empire onto their Board of Directors. When the day finally comes that pot can be bought at your local convenience store, they will be good to go all over the planet.

still long rad no worry,
"gioI would look at this from another direction.   The best that WBA could work out with the FTC was about 1500 profitable RAD stores.   They wanted to get far more but could not.RAD is stuck with some number untethered locations that are going to leave a very fractured geography  and burdens them with higher distribution costs.  How they supply such stores may or may not work out.   In some cases they might have to close a profitable store just because of distribution issues. RAD apparently made a case with the FTC that some of these stores would not be economic to keep and they would close them soon.  The FTC, I am guessing, allowed WBA to take these stores, move the script files to existing WBA stores and close them.   Normally the FTC is trying to keep more stores in business and enable a robust competition, but they probably could not stop this because the underlying RAD stores probably were basically dogs.WBA still makes money because they are not stuck with the operating losses of a closed store.  They get the script files which are probably worth $2M per location and dump the inventory on to a liquidator.   As far as grocery business goes, the ""prepared meals"" concept sounds great, but the market is actually limited to metro areas where there are busy consumers who are willing to pay up for convenience.  The revenues are still a small part of the store, but do produce proportionately as large share of profits as deli counters and bakeries do.   Much of the margin compression in grocery has to do with deflation in food which is not going to last forever.I agree that pharmacy margins are generally no longer in the control of chains like RAD, but the PBMS  now tell them how much a pharmacist gets to keep for dispensing the product.   The only profit left is for the branded drugs sold to customers who pay out of pocket because they don't have insurance or the policy they do have excludes it from a formulary.  (Since many folks are now covered under ""self-insured"" plans rather than traditional indemnity health insurance.....the eligible brands permitted in formularies gets tighter.....but drug companies are advertising them even more aggressively.  These branded pharma ads cost a huge amount of money and the reason while they persist on TV is because they work effectively.)  Look at this as phama fighting back at insurers with high buck TV ads.  If Pharma companies were losing money on the ads, they would stop..  The  ads to get the patient to force a doctor to prescribe a brand..  The doctors will do it as long as the customer willing to pay a much higher price for the brand (and the pharmacies likely make a good chunk of money on them since the insurer is not involved.)   This also applies to expensive dermatology zit medicines for kids which insurers do not pay for and you will reluctantly shell out at very inflated list prices.   This is where Valeant made its money and they pampered dermatologist doctors to keep the business coming..  Maybe a nice expensive conference in a exotic carribean resort in January for a really cheap vacation...because it is subsidized...works quite effectively.",
Apart from technical analysis any other ideas why this doing down 7%,
"Could tell you 1000 stories.  Over a drink some day...There is margin compression all over retail, and I suspect opioids are at most a tiny piece of the story.Grocery has been showing margin compression (KR stock got killed when they talked about it).  Competition from WalMart and now a little bit of on-line, plus the German competitors spooking the market too.  Grocery profit is now all in deli / prepared meals;  the rest of the store is cut-throat pricing.  In you are ever in the Philly area, go to a Wegman's and see what the future of grocery looks like.Pharmacy margin compression is primarily due to insurance negotiations.  Front of store is also now more competitive, particularly in urban markets, where Amazon (and others) have become ""convenience stores"" that deliver common goods from milk to tp in an hour or less.PS -- I'm not buying the storyline that WBA took RAD's bad assets.  Pessina isn't stupid;  he may have taken some dogs with the cash cows to get the deal done, but he didn't just get dumped on.  If WBA took only RAD's bad assets, how is that the same store sales trends of remainco are so bad?",
"gioInteresting story from your personal experience.   I wonder if the amount of money being spent out there for promotional activity has grown in recent years?    My guess is that there are so many dollars thrown that the merchandising management in a retail chain, that eventually they get distracted and spend a lot of time how to game the promotions and get maximum rebates for the chain, while neglecting the share of the store operations where no promotion activity exists.RAD shares have backed off this morning back to about 2.30, while the overall eupohria in the stock market is as nuts as ever.  Looking as certain stocks such as AMZN, I am guessing here that the public has now woken up to the stock market and they all want in and are pouring tons of money into index funds again.  The same FANG stocks are being bid up due to algos and not based on any real solid events.Unfortunately for a stock like RAD is that it gets lost in the euphoria as speculation money rolls into the stocks that are screaming higher.   Seen it before.I suspect that the 500 stores WBA is getting from RAD, were probably lousy locations and perhaps had been losing a lot of money.  RAD didn't close them, because it still had to pay the lease.   WBA is able to create value by transferring the script list to an existing store and that is what they wanted all along.   What we don't know, is how much of a DENT these 500 stores were putting in RADs earnings.  Maybe they will have a very favorable income pickup because the losers are gone.  RAD hasn't disclosed anything about it.Another factor that is probably affecting all of the chains including WBA and CVS is that they all say that there is gross margin compression.  To some extent, this might be due to the fact they were making tons of money selling opioids and now they are not and the comps look bad.  The chains are never going to admit that opioids were proftitable and in future quarters the margins ought to quit declining, at least for the opioid reason.  Nobody wants to admit that in a large state like GA, it has been reported that some 45 opioids were sold to every man, woman and child per year--- at the peak.   All of the chains rode this wave and many times the prescription was fillied at list price because the patient didn't want to run it through drug insurance.",
"When loyalty cards first came out in grocery stores, which was long before any of the pharmacy chains, the early adopter chains made huge amounts of money just selling data.  At that time, the advertisers never had such great data about how to focus ads and promotions.  The value of knowing about the actual customer buying a specific product and size was significant because, up to that point, the consumer goods companies like P&G had to spend a lot more doing crude surveys to know their customer preferences.    When these loyalty cards came out, it was a big deal for data miners and the amount paid to retailers for the data was probably much greater than today.  What has changed is that, instead of a few chains having loyalty cards, now just about all of them do.  The data is more plentiful and a grocer cannot extract as much profit from selling it.  Same is probably true for pharmacies, to some extent, but pharmacies sell a lot of branded cosmetics, lipstick, nail polish, wrinkle removers all which carry huge markups.It all depends on what you biuy at a RAD store.  I will guarantee that if you buy a greeting card for $ 5 or more, the markup is probably 500%.   The variations in markups are considerable.  Drug stores probably also suffer more from theft because with few employees on site, they cannot monitor it and can't pay for security personnel like a Target or WalMart woouldWhen it comes to data mining, I bet Amazon is better at using data and tracking its customers than any chain.   Amazon might value the data collected more than the few pennies it has left after free shipping expense.",
"Rad should just have a general card at the register like at Kroger to be used when a customer does not have a card.

My feeling is that we're going to have a little retrace  down to 2.10 or so.   I still think we're a few months away from a real catalyst.   I think we'll have a lot of profit taking the next few days and I think we'll hit 2.1 in the next week.  Patience :).,
"Captain America,I saw the $2.5B gain number as well, but I suspect that is the GAAP number.  The Taxable number filed with the IRS will differ because the tax basis will not be the same as GAAP BV for all assets.  My guess is that any type of fixed assets were using accelerated depreciation for tax.  The tax basis of inventory will be LIFO whcih they have been adjusting out when reporting GAAP results.   A large chunk of the gain is going to be from the sale of script files which likely have the same basis for GAAP and Tax.  Hard to know for sure.So, it is possible that because of accelerated depreciation and LIFO,  the Taxable gain will be  higher than $2.5B and perhaps $2.7 Billion, which is roughly equal to the current Federal NOL.   On a state basis---however--- the NOL is closer to $5 B and I assume some of that will now have to be written off in the DTA as they exit some states.  (Of course, the shareholder rights deal based on NOL's possibly being forfeited because of a hostile buyer is still shaky story but likely there just to protect management as a delaying tactic.)",
"According to the 10-Q, RAD will be using $2.5B of the existing Federal NOL carryforwards to offset the gain on the asset sales to WBA.  I've been waiting a while to finally see this disclosure from RAD.  Not sure why it took so long.  None of the analysts ever bothered to ask this important question --- go figure.  Not sure what happens to the $5.0B of existing State NOL carryforwards with the sale, but these aren't as important.",

Just an observation to note: the 1 year chart is going to appear much more favorable soon after the big fall off the 8.77 high cliff fades out of view.

"I put the Amazon purchasing RAD thesis as very low probability, but does anyone find it interesting that AMZN has been very quiet after announcing they would announce info on entrance into pharmacy around Thanksgiving.

This of course assuming AMZN wants to enter retail pharma, and considers how long and how much $ it would take to scale to RAD's level of sales.  I imagine WBA would want to avoid an AMZN purchase of RAD at all costs.  If it happened what an ironic twist of fate and end to this twisting and turning saga.  Anyway fun to dream big but perhaps I have better odds predicting the super bowl champion than AMZN buying RAD.  Go Eagles!",
With RAD jumping up 14 cents this morning---as I write this--- and traded at 2.50 at one point. I suspect it woke a sleeping investor at the conference who asked backup staff for more analysis and decided RAD is worth a shot.I think that RAD had put itself in the doghouse with big investors in the last year or so and they would not even bother to look at going long.   Since the biggest shareholder of RAD was  Vanguard with 4 index funds---nobody seems to have wanted it other than retail investors.  My hope is that dynamic has now changed.  Only time will tell.Note that 16 million shares traded in first hour.  Normal for full day is perhaps 20 to 25.,
8 bucks to 2 bucks..oooh yea..it really has it going on....,
"I'm curious to see what happens to the price after the rights are distributed.  If I'm buying new shares, I would of course be concerned about getting diluted and basically wiped out by the poison pill... however unlikely this would be.  Is it possible that the shorts will really beat this down because new buyers will be less likely to buy after the rights are distributed?  I don't like this poison pill in the least.",
"AssymetricI am a long time fan of Bollinger Bands and find them extremely useful in some stocks.In the case of RAD, however, which is not a ""normal"" stock in any sense of the word, I really don't think they are helpful.But it is a GOOD IDEA  to let some RAD bulls here KNOW that a 47% or 42% or 23% retracement is POSSIBLE.   Smart investors always need to know that in owning stock and playing with real money there always is RISK.   Bollinger did a great job synthesizing the data and trading patterns of thousands of stocks over time and makes statistical sense of it, but my vote is not to apply this technique to RAD.",
"Today was obviously a good day for everyone not short or holding puts. From a technical perspective, we are in trouble here. In the last twelve months, there have been four times where RAD hit overbought territory as measured by RSI while also violating its upper Bollinger Band. Today was the fourth time. The first time saw a correction of 47% over two weeks, the second time saw a correction of 42% over two weeks, and the third time (and I posted this as maybe this time is different but probably not) the correction was less severe at 23% over a one week selloff. If we model another less severe sell off of 10-20% we will see support in the 1.90 to 2.10 range, where a rising channel and 50 Day Moving Averages also help. There is a possibility of a correction through time, where it goes sideways for a week or two and launches higher. It is also possible someone is accumulating shares before the poison pill kicks in and shorts will continue to be punished. However, the highest probability is a price correction.I realize most SA readers prefer fundamental analysis over technical, and this post is not for them. I like to use fundamental analysis to determine what I want to scale into as a core position and use technical analysis to hedge around that position.For any one interested in learning about how Bollinger Bands work (using the same principles that casinos use to separate people from their money), I wrote a mini tutorial of how to use Bollinger Bands as it applied to preemptively analyzing an opportunity:http://bit.ly/2qWTTDjJohn Bollinger read it and posted his one and only comment ever on SA. The model turned out to be correct and the ""what actually happened"" was followed up in a subsequent article.",
Short of massive accounting fraud or the equivalent I would say no chance within the next 2-3 years is accurate. Who knows beyond that. Anyone suggesting BK in the short term is likely a short caught in a squeeze.  🙂,
No chance of BK within next few years or longer. That's FUD.,
"Even crystal balls will not tell you where it will go, it could just as easily close all stores and go bankrupt.",
"i agree with Rick that Rad share price at these levels does feel very good. There is obviously still a large short contingent but it sure feels as though things are stabilizing. Anyone who got in under $1.70 over the past few months should feel good about their position. With continuing the divestiture, more info on ""risk sharing"" and info on the M&A front it seems like perhaps a steady rise in share price hopefully leading to a buyout in Q2....OR Crawford drives enough efficiencies that RAD makes a go of it as a standalone (not what i expect). But either way i think there is a lot more upside than downside risk and am looking forward to the ride. good luck to all",
"Some tempting pricing on RAD calls.Jan 2019 $3.50 fetching about $0.30Jan 2019 $4.00 fetching about $0.22Jan 2020 $3.50 fetching over $0.50Jan 2020 $4.00 fetching about $0.40Those Jan 2020 $4s are really interesting.  Lowering my basis $0.40 in exchange for giving up someone paying more than $4 for the company isn't bad.  If the price jumped to $4.40 on buyout rumors, I'd be a seller anyway, even if the rumored price was $6.",
"RAD stock sure feels better here.   I am not sure how much of this could be due to options players who might have gotten their asses kicked as options expiry comes soon.   Zillions of amateurs playing options in RAD for some odd reason.Overall market today in retail stocks quite strong. Even a dud like FREDs is up so I am a bit cautious in believing Crawfords pitch is driving RAD up yet.  My guess is that serious value investors might take a couple of weeks to jump in, if they ever do.Markets are apparently seeing investors now getting scared about bond prices crashing as the congress just ran up the deficit with the tax cut.   As they bail from bonds and reallocate to stocks, it will raise all tides.   Important to know that during the Watergate era and few details had been made known, the stock market was very good.  And then Nixon got reelected and the Wash Post told all and by the time Nixon left, I read somewhere recently that the market was down about 50%, which was a massacre.  The Post is still in business and now backed by Amazon's Bezos who can spend unlimited money to ferret out stuff, so hold on to your knickers.   The tax cut is old news, nobody really knows if companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc will actually bring any cash back into the USA.  Markets can't  run forever on thin air and uncertainty like what is going on in DC.",
"FYIRAD filed 10Q after presentation yesterday.For nerds who cannot get enough informaton about the divestiture. this might be worth a look.New info is disclosed about numbers of stores disposed, gains, nature of assets sold and what appears to be new info about how many stores were divested during the month of Decemberhttp://bit.ly/2qTH1hc",
"This baby is staring to move, is going to pop major very soon",
great move today long .long rad.,
Short interest was 15.35% of the float as of 12/29.  It will be interesting to see how that number changes in the next few weeks... Is today “up on technicals” or are shorts realizing their risk after seeing a fairly good presentation that shows the way forward. Let’s see how the market responds by closing today.,
"Rite Aid (NYSE: RAD) is looking at setting up risk-sharing arrangements with outside parties to deliver better patient care at lower costs, according to Bloomberg, citing a separate report from DealReporter. The DealReporter story cites an interview with CEO John Standley on the sidelines of the JPMorgan conference.Standley said the Aetna/CVS deal has industrial logic and it may look to potentially partner with a health insurer or network provider, but it doesn't have to be a merger.Standley declined to comment on potential Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) interest.",
"1. Stronger position for remaining storesBigger isn't always better. For Rite Aid, the company could even be more competitive when the sale of stores to Walgreens is completed.John Standley noted that Rite Aid's new footprint includes 2,569 stores in 19 states, clustered primarily along the east and west coasts of the U.S. He said that in four of those states -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and Oregon -- over half of Rite Aid's remaining stores rank first in their respective markets. In California, New York, and Washington state, at least 40% of the company's stores rank either first or second in their markets.Rite Aid's remaining stores also generate more front-end store sales and pharmacy sales on average than the company did prior to the asset sales to Walgreens. In addition, Standley said that over 63% of Rite Aid's current store portfolio have been remodeled to support the company's wellness focus. Results for wellness stores tend to outperform those stores that haven't been remodeled.2. Improved leverageOne of the biggest concerns for Rite Aid in the past was its crushing debt load. Standley pointed out that the proceeds from the sale of the stores to Walgreens are being deployed to debt reduction, resulting in Rite Aid's leverage ratio dropping from 7.6 as of Dec. 2, 2017 to 4.6 when the transition of stores is finalized. The company's debt will decline from $6.7 billion to a more manageable $2.9 billion.Darren Karst provided more good news about Rite Aid's debt. Currently, much of the company's debt reaches maturity in 2020. However, along with paying down a big chunk of the debt, Rite Aid is also restructuring its debt to give it a more attractive maturity profile, with the earliest notes reaching maturity in 2023.3. Success for customer loyalty programKermit Crawford, who joined Rite Aid as COO in September after a long career with Walgreens, gave an encouraging update about Rite Aid's Wellness+ customer loyalty program. He said that the loyalty program had 20.7 million active members as of the end of 2017.Crawford noted that 79% of the company's front-end sales and 57% of pharmacy sales stemmed from loyalty program members last year. That's good news for Rite Aid, since the average basket size for loyalty program customers is 7.1% higher than that of customers who aren't members of the program.4. Lower generic purchase prices comingAlthough Rite Aid's size will be much smaller after the transition of stores to Walgreens, the company should still enjoy pricing power for generic drugs. As part of the agreement with Walgreens, Rite Aid has an option to participate in the company's purchasing network for 10 years.However, Crawford said that exercising that option isn't a foregone conclusion. He stated that Rite Aid is conducting an RFP (request for proposal) process in an effort to get the lowest possible drug pricing prior to exercising the option with Walgreens Boots Alliance. Rite Aid's current contract with McKesson expires in March 2019, while the Walgreens option expires in May 2019. Regardless of what happens, lower generic purchase prices could be on the way, which should help boost profitability for Rite Aid. 5. Impressive growth in EnvisionRx Medicare Part D membershipCrawford touted Rite Aid's EnvisionRx pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business as a ""growth engine"" for the company. He said that Rite Aid wants to especially expand the EnvisionRx's specialty pharmacy business.There was also a positive update for EnvisionRx. Crawford shared that Rite Aid projects 600,000 Medicare Part D members for EnvisionRx by the end of 2018. That's a 52% increase over 2017. He suggested that this growth could also benefit Rite Aid by steering more customers to its stores.http://bit.ly/2qSQjtV",
"sailorI think that Farmers point is that there have been a lot of leaks coming from somewhere and he is damned mad enough about it to take a pitchfork and truckload of horse manure to the SEC on F St in DC and demand an investigation. There is no telling what he might do because he apparently is plenty mad about seeing the price of the stock vaporize to the current levels.While you are right that one can possess inside information legally as long as you don't trade on it, the story gets much more complicated than that.Some SA readers could easilty be exposed here because of options trading an strategies that were employed about the time of the leaks.  If the  traded options occurred in a relevant time period where there were a number of  media leaks, which are eventually proved to be accurate it can be insider trading.  This applies, as I understand, even if the options trader was clueless about the source nor validity of the leak.   Farmer has a point and he could defintely stir up an investigation, in my view, because the WBA/RAD merger has been perhaps the leakiest boat of all time.  As I understand, the SEC actually focuses on options trades in such investigtions because insiders use them to make a quick buck with little at risk.   It's another ramifcation of trading options.   Almost anytime there is a merger announcement, the SEC ---I have been told---looks at all trades before it like a hawk.   You can get lucky and buy a stock that is done without a clue of inside info and still wind up in the regulator gun sights.For those who held actual RAD shares and never bought or sold, there is no problem.""Farmer"" is actually a lot smarter than he looks, but can be a bit grumpy from time to time.",
"Dumb Farmer:""if the news of the merger being blocked was accurate and came from leaks at the Federal Trade Commission ,that would mean that people at the Federal Trade Commission and the people who received this information , Capital Forum and the New York post , are guilty of felony insider trading under the'' Stock act '',select people profited from insider information which was never released by the Federal Trade Commission.""You are not a ""Inside Trader"" if you haven't traded!",
"I missed it, but assume that giofls made a good summary above.Based on market action today, I am guessing market reaction is good. Price seems to be pushing higher and 2.14 as I write this. Doesn't sound like the terrible concall from September.It is probably going to be hard to find out how well attended RADs presentation was.   Typically a conference like this will have a keynote speaker like Bill Gates or Jamie Dimon (at this one) and then the attendees likely break out into various company pep talks.   When RAD presented there may have been other companies at the same time.  Most of the others  are the really big mega cap healthcare operations as compared to a puny 2 buck stock in RAD that the snobbiest portfolio managers will regard as a bottle of ""2 buck chuck"" in a fine restaurant.  Hopefullly RAD got some new visibility.  If some attendees liked it, the typical process is to put it on an elgible list of companies worth of further look.  It might take a week or two for this to happen.  Some of the ""value fund"" managers who should be interested are extremely conservative folks and move as slow as a turtle.  Value investors tend to be a boring group in my view.",
"The RAD presentation to the JPM conference is available on SA.  Not a bad read.Of course, it is long on big idea and short on specifics, but all these presentations are like that.  What was good to see was mention of some topics they'd been glossing over, like how they'll attack cutting SGA.  A few goofy things buried in there, like that they were going to start doing RFPs on pharma buys;  what were they doing in the past?  If they weren't and they are going to start now, there is probably some money in it.The financials thus far on remainco are disappointing, but it is good they are starting to put  ideas together to fix it and implicitly commit to those changes by putting them on paper and presenting them.  Obviously the market liked that message today.If Kermit Crawford can bring that kind of fiscal discipline to a company that has clearly lacked it, that is the most bullish message yet.  Now the pressure is on to execute, and I don't think the market is going to give them more than a couple of quarters to demonstrate results.I continue to be cautious with a small long position.  There is a lot of risk here.  But I was glad to finally see something I could call good news.",
I missed webcast of JPM presentation - recording is not yet available - any highlights?,
anybody listen in to the presentation?,
No debt due until 2023 after sale.,
long rad......,
"papaGood post above and I hope you are right about RAD.I think you enjoy the slams and insults more than you admit to.I think it is worth mentioning that a lot of places where one can get investment knowledge and insights, there is no interaction.  Somebody writes a piece and you can take it or leave it.  And many of the so-called knowledgeable analysts today are quants....all they do is take data and plug in numbers.  They don't invest their personal money.  They really don't have anything at risk except reputation.  They listen to a con call, run a model, write a report andm move on to the next company in a long list they are required to follow.  Most of these street analysts actually know much less about RAD than we do, because they don't have the time to spend pouring through SEC filings due to a demanding work load.  They provide reports to clients who pay for it through trading commissions, and the knowledge of one company when following 50 or more can get quite superficial.The difference with SA boards, is that the discussion gets intense and personal because just about every reader has personal money at stake.  They have skin in the game.   Or they might be looking at a stock to get exposed in the future.  We are playing with real money here.  It is not like an institutional portfolio manager who knows a lot about the stocks but really has little at stake and conversations tend to be more polite but I have seen some that were quite vitriolic .  Some mutual funds groups never made managers invest in the fund they directed.  It sounds crazy but these managers only advise others how to risk money and never their own.   Giving out recommendations is one thing, risking your own money is another matter. There is a damned good reason why these discussions get more intense.....its the personal money at risk.",
"v.c.Stupidity and genius are not real time measurements. It requires a look back into time, so time passage will reveal our levels of brilliance or idiocy. I liked the article because it pressed the envelope in some different ways of looking at RAD. It was encouraging to me as a past contributor that the RAD community was mostly very professional in their disagreements and feedback to the author. Game Theory or whoever you are...keep pressing the envelope...SA needs your POV.",
The article is very informative and I like it. I wish the author did not respond at all. Most of his replies are meaningless. After liking article as it aligns with my (long)perspective now I wonder am I really stupid.,
"Pressure will be put on MckessonJohn StandleyYes. Okay, yes. So yes, we would likely buy the vast majority or all of our generics from one entity versus trying to break up into pieces. I don't think that would make sense for us. And so what the -- we have the option to move to WBAD really after we complete selling about half--Darren Karst50% of the stores.John Standley50% of the stores. So, sometime in the spring, we'll get over that hurdle. But we really can't move until we resolve our situation with McKesson because we're obligated right now to purchase generics from McKesson. So, that was really the timing I talked about earlier. Depending on how things kind of work out with McKesson, it could be as late as March of 2019 before we get there, or if we can work out some other arrangement with McKesson, it could be sooner.",
"Encouraging remarks by Chief Executive Officer at Envision Frank SheehySure Lisa. Thanks for the question. I think, first, fortunately, we don't have any jumbo major accounts up for bid as we go into 2019, so we really have secured those larger accounts for the renewal. And I -- then as we go forward into the selling season, for really 2019 and mid-year 2018, we're pretty excited.I think the market is very much looking for alternatives right now to the jumbo PBMs and I think we provide a great alternative because we provide a comprehensive suite of services, but we also make them available on an a-la-carte basis.And I think health plans, in particular, are very interested in leveraging some of those services on an a-la-carte basis and I think if you look at the market and some of the movement recently, that validates that.We're also at an all-time high right now on the number of RFPs in-house at this time of year for 2018 start date. So, we have a lot of business mid-market, and we think that's going to portray well as we go towards 1/1/19. Already seeing a lot of RFPs for managed care plans that we're seeing. So, we're very bullish.And I guess, the last thing I'd mention is, to Kermit's point earlier, I think there's real opportunity of leveraging some of Rite Aid's other assets to provide, again, that comprehensive service in a way that we haven't in the past and I think the market will find that very attractive.",
"I'm thinking we'll get a little pop out of the presentation on the 10th.  Perfect chance to scalp 10 to 20 cents before the shorts bring it back down again.  I think there's a lot of naked shorting here, and when they've got to cover, it;s gonna be time for a very nice squeeze.Got 20k extra shares now to swing trade with.   Thanks, shorts!",
"Game theoryTake my word for it.  Price to sales ratio is very inappropriate for RAD.  It's now going to be different mix of business with less retail and more PBM.  Quantitative analysis has some value but it tends to be a very narrow approach to financial analysis in my experience.One aspect of retail pharmacy that has to be considered here is that standalone retail drug stores, such as all of those operated by RAD have about 1200 sq ft devoted to Rx and the rest of the store which is about 10000 ft selling general merchandise greeting cards and cosmetics.   The Rx side and the non Rx are two very different businesses.   Walmart is a large player in retail Rx and it offers them at prices which are likely barely profitable, because WMT really want you to stop and buy a $100 of other goods.   Kroger is the same format.Does any of your quant analysis above consider that information? Doesn't seem that way to me.   You really can't compare it to WBA which does not really own anything significant in the PBM business,  but has a 25% interest in Amerisource a very large drug wholesaler.   You really can't compare it to CVS either, which operates a significant PBM is Caremark.  CVS also now runs the pharmacy operations in Target stores where it just dispenses scripts but does not participate in low profit general merchandise or extremely profitable cosmetic sales, which is what a normal RAD store would do.",
"Amazing how people continue to pretend RAD is not a horrible operator of store business. It is absurd to compare value of RAD to list in article of fully functional companies who have prospered for years (HD, AMZN, COST etc...). Compare RAD to other inept companies if they even still exist for an apples to apples compare. And remember a stock does not have to go up but can go to zero under worst case scenario. Why mess with garbage like this when dozens of performing companies have stock prices which continue to perform and pay nice dividends. To each his/her own though.",
"Author says:""The TBPP arrangement gives a sort of deadline in that it will take effect for shareholders of record on 1-16-2018. Basically, if someone wanted to take a larger than 5% position ahead of a buyout offer, it better get it done before Jan 16, 2018 or it will be magnitudes more expensive to do so at a later date.""response:  I don't think anybody should take the above statement at face value unless you are a securities attorney familiar with this specific agreement,IF it were TRUE, then Standley just moved up the incentive for a big buyer to sweep up shares in the open market at $2 and this is just not happening.The poison pill does not put the company on ice after January 16 for another 2 years.It is a delaying tactic.  The board can remove the rights at any time it wants to do so according to the CFO on the last concall.And using"" price to sales"" to value this company is a very weak financial metric",
"Tender Offer or Proxy FightWhen a company, an investor or a group of investors makes a tender offer to purchase the shares of another company at a premium above the current market value, the board of directors might reject the offer. The acquiring company can take that offer directly to the shareholders, who may choose to accept it if it is at a sufficient premium to market value or if they are unhappy with current management. The sale of the stock only takes place if a sufficient number of stockholders agree to accept the offer.In a proxy fight, opposing groups of stockholders persuade other stockholders to allow them to vote their shares. If a company that makes a hostile takeover bid acquires enough proxies, it can use those proxies to vote to accept the offer.Anything sub $4 never had a chance here. I believe management is truly looking to improve all metrics and become profitable.",

"Thank you for your analysis. I do have one question. Included in your article a link to the FTC statement on the RAD-WBA proposed merger. I have been long Rite Aid for 15 years and have an extremely large holding. Somehow I missed the FTC statement when issue.  The statement includes in part the following “Before the time the companies would have been free to close their transaction absent Commission action, they voluntarily withdrew their HSR filings, and the matter is no longer before the Commission.” This statement is confusing and apparently unusual for the FTC to make such a statement? Why did the FTC issue it? I would appreciate if you could explain what this means and why FTC felt compelled to issue such an extraordinary statement. Thanks.",
"Game Theory, please explain why the Jan 2018 calls would impact a potential buyer.  I can see how a buyout (albeit improbable) now would cause the buyer (AMZN or private equity) to pay more.  My understanding is that whoever wrote the covered or uncovered call options would be on the hook for whatever intrinsic value is created from the notional buyout or other catalyst causing the price to jump.  Thanks.",
"I agree as well, the problems, however start when you dig into the growth side of the equation.",
Thank you for your well thought out thesis. I had been thinking down is up and up is down in this bizarro world of RAD and its price action.

good article long rad to 2019 for me,
"Good article. Rad is a perfect example of what happens when arbitrageurs and short sellers play games with an equity. It is also an example, as you point out, of the fact that Graham's ""weighing machines"" thesis is only true in the long run. The stock market is, as Graham said, a voting machine. I also believe Rad is seriously undervalued and will hold my 7000 shares until the scales arrive and its correct weight (price) can be assessed.",
"<<In summary, if a new buyer were going to come forward with an offer that would have to be significantly higher than the current share price in order to avoid bidding wars, it would be to their advantage to wait until after the January monthly OPEX event in order to avoid unnecessary call option payouts.>>No.  No, no, no.  This is not how options work.  The loser in this scenario is the writer of the option, be it a market maker, retail, hedge fund, etc.  It has NOTHING to do with RAD.  Nor any acquirer (unless they happened to be short the option, but that's quite unlikely).",
"Very good article, thanks... any chance that CVS will become a potential buyer?",
it has 1.99 places it can go that aren't up,
"I hope you're right author, because my cost is north of 6, and no, i'm not averaging down. S&P just cut their pt from 2 to 1, not based on takeover speculation but the actual business. What do you think about that?",
"Here is the other side:-- Same store sales are declining by mid-single-digit % v prior year, and EBIT is down even more than that.  Total profitability is negative.-- they have the lowest margins among their peers and the highest SGA %;  they've yet to communicate how these will get better (or even how they'll not get worse) after they sell 1/3 of their retail locations to WBA.-- they completely screwed up their PBM business during the failed acquisition process with WBA, and revenue and EBITDA from EnvisionRx are way down.  I think one would have to be wearing rose-colored glasses to value EnvisionRx at more than 1/2 of what they paid for it at this time.-- their competitors are getting more aggressive and trying to lock up key chunks of business.  The likely outcome will be further squeezed margins-- the entire health care sector is under enormous price scrutiny, and it is likely CMS and large insurers will continue to increase their aggressiveness in negotiations, thus potential squeezing margins even more-- the ""pall of Amazon"" hangs over the pharmacy business as the markets await their decision and/or timing for entering the prescription business.-- the poison pill will keep activists out, so don't expect any kind of mgmt shake-upOther than that Mrs Lincoln, how was the play?Is it possible there is an acquirer out there who sees enough synergies to justify a hefty premium?  AMZN, KR, WMT, MCK, Sycamore, someone else??  RAD mgmt sure hopes so.  They thought they had one in WBA, but the govt appears to have killed that.  Also remember that post-WBA store sale they will still have at least $3.5B in long-term debt, so the price to buy is $5.5 B plus a premium.Without an acquirer, this stock isn't worth much until / unless they demonstrate the ability to turn around most of the list of items above.  It might even be over-valued at $2.  Mgmt is now 0 for 2 in recent conf calls at building any confidence in their ability to deliver.Trust me, it has lots of other place to go but up.",
"very interesting analysis, thanks.",
You certainly added some entertainment and thoughtful information and possibilities to an otherwise sad situation. Thank you.,

"Thanks, Samantha. Pesto is great. I have seen theirs in stores for years, as a part-time and native Californian and Bay Area native. Love the idea.",
"Thanks for the article--although I'd rather keep this gem all to myself!  My daughter came to me a little while ago, and asked me what stock to buy.  This is the one I recommended she add to her portfolio. ( I think highly of both her and the company!)  I buy this stock to balance out some more risky purchases; as noted above, the beta is very low.  The company conservatively allocates capital, which may be why, as noted above, the dividend was not raised last year.  Lastly, brokers are a two-edged sword; they save the costs of having a direct sales force, but also have other products to sell.  Re:  national distribution through acquisition, sales would be vastly enhanced by being folded into a company with a large sales force and deep distribution channels.  But, what the company does seems to be working--and even the addition of another broker would enhance growth.  For me, a very comfortable company to own.  Long and hangin' in.  Sincerely, V. Tucker Kirk",
"The lack of divvy increase in 2017 was due to major plant expansion and conservative company. If sales & revs follow the increase in manufacturing capacity, the divvy should too. Especially with Corp tax reform.",
"Nice article.  It did seem odd that the company did not increase the div in q4 ‘17.  My guess is that management was being conservative and wanted to pay off a little more of the debt before increasing the div.  If next quarters earnings look like q3’s, there is no reason not to increase the div by 15-20%.  Tax reform should boost eps as well.

It would make great sense for the company to be acquired to deal with the succession.2.  Well more than half of the company's sales are made through three brokers who take hefty commissions.  A company which already has a national distribution could replace the brokers for a fraction of the cost.  That could drive EPS by 50-80% depending on the efficiency of the existing sale/distribution network.  It is the main reason why Armanino is a good candidate for purchase by a big food company.3.  On the negative side, 2017 is the first year in at least 6 when the company did not increase the dividend.  The balance sheet looks strong, so there seems to be no reason for the failure to raise the div.  Maybe we'll see an increase next time.  My belief is that the company is holding the cash for a new investment.  The nature of that investment, however, should say much about the future prospects.There's more, but these are the main points.  I've owned AMNF since it was 26 cents per share (split adjusted).  It has been a wonderful investment, and I expect it to continue to be one.",

"Someone, perhaps Bill, should write an article expanding upon a point raised by the person who wrote the recent article indicating that GM is gong to crush Tesla in selling EV's..  That point was that Tesla is stupid to build superchargers to power EV's across the country and that the big car companies will simply wait for businesses, such as gas stations, to offer superchargers on their own on their property.  The author pointed out the William Ford didn't build gas stations when he sold a large number of Model T's -- he just waited for third parties to build the gas stations to accommodate, and profit from, the new type of vehicle -- the car -- that was being manufactured in Detroit..That concept certainly makes sense to me.  I think, in the not so distant future, gas stations will simply take out a gas pump or two and put in three types of EV charges -- one for Tesla and two for the other type of chargers the big car companies selling EV's now offer (though those need to be updated to match the power of Tesla's).  I'm waiting for someone to be the first to spot one of those type of ""pumps"" in the ""wild.""",
"CoverDrive,An additional factor is the need for experienced pounders for the Rubber Mallet Edition Model 3s.

"Bill, great article!I didn't see much (if any) discussion on your Q1 sales outlook, despite its importance to both longs and shorts.  It's likely that M3 will still have negligible GM in Q1, so MS/MX must carry the balance sheet.  But they're starting the quarter without momentum because of the  Q4 maneuvering to improve cash flow.  Lot inventory has been drawn down by about 6000 units in the last 2 quarters and cars-in-transit are down to a 9-day supply, about half of the normal amount.  So the question is whether they can both manufacture and deliver another 25,000 in Q1.  It's definitely going to be a challenge.  We should have a good idea by mid-Feb.",

TSLA stock will be pumped between now and that earnings report in order increase the price of the stock as much as possible.

The ramp is happening and Tesla said this: As a result of the significant growth in our production rate, we made as many Model 3's since December 9th as we did in the more than four months of Model 3 production up to that point.

"Curious what other makers (GM, Fiat-Christler, Ford) will have to spend to make their own EVs?  Unless the plan is to simply buy cheap Chinese EVs and resell, they will have to also make significant CapEx.  Ford seems to have no real plans for a competitive EV, and GM is losing significant cash on every Bolt, and is even talking of eliminating the Volt.Since International pressure will force the U.S. to go electric, the CapEx will come sooner or later (my guess sooner).Tesla makes money on every car sold (if you examine cost baskets, most of expenditures are on new product lines, acquisitions, R&D... not production).Also, what will the Big2 (and Fiat-Chrys) do without recurring parts and service revenue?

If the answer is Restasis, and a treatment for the liver condition NASH--AGN is clearly not so attractive to PFE today as it was in 2015.AGN has a wide moat, and its shares have declined sharply since 2015. Morningstar suggests AGN's shares have been beaten like a rented mule. They're now among the most undervalued wide-moat names in healthcare. If not PFE, someone else is likely to become interested in AGN. http://bit.ly/2qFZdemRich-unck:12hrs",
"Can't see why Pfizer would be interested in AGN any longer with the tax inversion issue mute.  Too many question marks for AGN right now and PFE wants instant growth not projections about potential phase 3 data and their impact.  I dont see this happening at all and certainly not for on the cheap.  If we do see this sprout up and a low price fixed to it, then we know for sure AGN is in trouble but my guess is Saunders will play up AGN as if its value is worth even more than two years ago.",
"Because of the upcoming loss of AGN'S patent protection on Restasis in 2018 and the competitive threat to Botox by Revance's RT002, which lasts 6 month's vs. Botox's 4 months, in 2020, AGN is worth a lot less today than it was 2 years ago.  AGN has a lot of drugs in its pipeline but whether they can replace Restasis and Botox is a major concern.",

"I think the order from China of only A320 type aircraft has to be a real blow to Airbus and unless this changes shortly to the A380 as well (as I said before, I think the time is short).  I read that Airbus was offering finishing work (interiors, etc.), but at least up until now, China does not seem to be biting.  Not the right article for these comments, but as always, the A320 line is a popular aircraft.   And as always, I am noting that no A350s included????, and  China does need a larger short haul aircraft, and I really think that Boeing should be getting to work on the 797.",
Great article. Let’s see what happens,
DB a really interesting article.Personally I think AB will get enough orders to keep the A380 in production until things such as demand in Asia makes it inevitable and fuel costs move upwards to justify four engines but large passenger numbers per aircraft. In other words back to a lot of the original thinking behind the design knocked off course by the decline in fuel prices allowing older aircraft to remain in service.,
great article as always.,
"It will be interesting to see how the China negotiations play out and how much Europe/Airbus is willing to play with the future for the present.   I do not think that a finishing center for the A380 will be much of a bargaining chip, as it is older technology, and they already have this type of thing.  I think however they might take A380s if they can get anything more related to the A350.   For Airbus the situation is pretty clear.  Either they get China to sign up for some A380s which will also win them the order from Emirates(which buys them time to see if airport congestion saves the program), or they they look at several years of losses while they build Emirate's last 40 or so planes, and start shutting down the program.  I do not know how the long lead parts play out or how they have negotiated getting bundled parts in advance, but I suspect decision time is not far off in the future.",
"One thing lacking in this discussion is the fuel price and how it could skew the market place. If fuel prices do increase at a steady pace over the next ten years faster than a demand model  for old technology flying, then the 777X will move more towards the market bulls eye.

"@Dhierin BechaiAs for market forecasts, one should keep in mind that the OEMs typically tend to inflate the estimates in market segments where they are offering solid products, while deflating the estimates in market segments where they are not.As for China, I wouldn't be surprised to see Airbus making a comprehensive deal with respect to the A380 that could include:1) An order for, say, 30 A380plus aircraft. Such a deal could include an A380 completion and delivery centre (CDC). Deliveries would stretch from 2020/2021 to 2025.2) Airbus launching a next generation A380-900/A380-1000. The NG including possibly a fuselage upgrade (i.e. e.g. with A350-type composite fuselage panels); the A380plus wing enhancements; and with engines that are at least 15 percent more efficient than the current Trent-900/GP7000 engines (i.e. RR Advance/Ultrafan type engines.) - altogether leading to a 25 percent lower trip fuel burn for an A380-800NG version.3) China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CAS) signing with Airbus a general terms agreement for the purchase of a total of 200 A380NG aircraft for deliveries from 2026 to, say, 2036; and with Airbus signing a new strategic partnership with the Chinese government for an A380NG Final Assembly Line (FAL) in China - similar in set-up to the A320 FAL in Tianjin.",
Very tough environment now until Korean issues resolve some.,
I believe there is 747 covering Francfurt Berlín route,
"Maybe A380 arrived too soon, 10 years early. Demand in Asia is there, A380 could cover low cost 600 seats and the pilgrimage root to Jeddah",

"Thanks for the reply. The math for the 380 is not even close. Boeing including the 777X in the VLA forecast category is natural in the sense that BA has admitted for years that the 777X capacity is a 747P killer.The 747 is a far more versatile aircraft than the 380. I do not believe even the AB market lies could revive a freighter or stretch version which might have helped that flawed product to but the final knife into the life of the ""Queen of the Sky's"". The 747 will be around, in production, long after the ashes of the 380 have cooled.Go Boeing!!!!!",
"DB too much speculation without the reality check!!!! The 380 launch was a political decision based on false demand data. AB imagined a VLA availability pool 4X larger than the market could possibly absorb, especially with the advent of long range medium density aircraft. AB's primary focus has not been market success but rather market manipulation and killing competition. Putting products on the line with little or no validation or private funding. Just huge campaigns to garner state support and investment. These governments want a weak America and/or failed Boeing. Their treasuries have been floating AB since the beginning. On day one of the 380, AB was forecasting 2500 VLAs needed. At the time, Boeing spent almost 40 years building the 747 and had only built 1500 units. AB's data was a lie and is a lie. I have suggested to you before to look at the history and accuracy of the archived Boeing and Airbus forecasts from years past to see who the better crystal ball reader is. This should tell you a lot about how much faith we should put into the current forecasts and trust into which company.Thanks for your dedication. I do seek out your articles even if I do not agree with your position very often.John",
so lets recap. Airbus is thrashing Boeing in the single aisle business and Airbus has the only VLA in the segment. But Boeing is winning the larger margin wide bodied section?,
"If the A380 is not totally dead, and they can tie up with China, this looks like a challenge for Boeing since BA's numbers of jumbo planes will not be achieved.I cannot see how Airbus can totally scrap their A380. As a matter of fact, I do not see them doing so.",Potential For The Airbus A380

"""Apple trades for fairly low valuation levels...""  No.  The market capitalization at $885 billion is near an all time high and Apple is a highly cyclical company.

"Going by what a bunch of articles here and in media general claim about repatriation taxes, there are going to be some MASSIVELY puzzled analysts when Apple reports earnings!1.  Yes, there will be a tax expense of 15% on a portion of Apple offshore profits.   But only the portion that Apple regarded as unlikely to be repatriated.2.   Apple has already expensed tax at 35% on the rest of its offshore profits.   It is expensed but not paid - sitting in deferred tax liability on balance sheet.So there will be a reversal of past tax expenses (likely a one-time profit event on P&L) with an equivalent deduction in the liabilities on balance sheet.   I would need to dig back to find the amount but I think the liability was near $40b so it will become 70/35%x15.5% so $22b or so.The deemed unlikely to be repatriated offshore profits will now be subject to an expense hit, but it would have to approach $200b of pretax offshore profit to beat out the correction to the taxes already expensed per above.   That is roughly ALL of its pretax profits for past three years.So no, Apple will have to report a rather significant net positive impact in its P&L with equivalent deduction in liabilities.As to cash, it actually really does not matter:1.  It would not be repatriating foreign denominated assets - per reports Apple holds mostly dollar denominated.   So, little to no change in currency exposures2.  It is not changing ownership by repatriating.   It always was theirs, this just changes in which legal entity it sits.3.  They will pay the 15% whether they repatriate or not.For the past few years Apple has effectively just been doing its corporate finance really well, lubricated by what was a very silly tax system that ignored unrepatriated foreign taxes.   They provided taxes but did not pay it, instead earning income on the deferred taxes.   They have I think 8 years to pay the 15% and Apple will probably just use the same tactics as long as deferral earns free income.For now there should certainly be a rather large earnings impact and reduction in liabilities.

"I agree that Apple will probably use a majority of the returned funds for share buybacks.As a share holder myself I would prefer an increased dividend but the dividend yield will only increase slightly I reckon.This is another indication of what nonsense Mnuchin and the billionaires in the White House are talking when they say tax cuts will lead to more investment in the USA and more high-paying jobs.The guys backing Trump got their tax break and are happy now-it's uncertain if Trump understands it at all,but this trickle-down strategy was proven a poor idea during George Bush's time.",

Of course China has the advantage of not having to overturn an ubiquitous credit card culture as in the USA, and the central government actively encourages the non-credit based payment system.

March 9th,
Any updates on this one? Shouldn't TGA be announcing earnings soon?,
It will drop if oil prices keep dropping...,
Somehow TGA has held strong over the past couple of weeks. I would have expected it to sink with the rest of the e&ps,
It's kind of crazy that this has traded within a 6 cents range for almost a month now.,
"If they had  not cut the dividend they would have had a lot more issues and buying the Canadian properties was not a bad idea, if anything TGA is a poster child for not being a diversified geography/politically oil company. Now  the timing was great price wise but the problem is the Canadians cannot get out of their own way with their most valuable assets as they keep proving.",
I am long TGA for a while....a large buildup in egyptian account receivables 200m saved this company during the down turn...account receivable collection generated cash to prevent company from going bankrupt..  management made a big mistake cutting dividend to zero when they still had a strong balance sheet...many investors hit the road.  management may have also made a mistake in making canadian acquisition...the acquisition for mostly cash adversely effected the balance sheet and increased the risk of bankruptcy...TGA  future entirely depends on future oil prices..another major downturn company goes bankrupt...oil prices increase big upside...stock will behave like an option on oil prices...i think???,
"TGA  is very cheap laggard and crude is at that level where they can generate a net positive cash flow from operations but the smoking gun here and the main reason why the firm has lagged is it  absolutely has the worst track record in its exploration/wildcatting department of any E&P  over the years which I think was the main culprit why the stock has stagnated against peers given the last results and which continues to be like a broken record player over many multiple years of this wasted capital with no return on that risky activity.However, if there is a known time gap where the firm just concentrates activities to well development I think you can make a very high return short term trade with this stock. Honestly, they badly need to change their operating model to reflect conditions of limitless reserves and strictly operate the company for positive net cash flow and use opportunities of  a cash hoard to take advantage of competitors mismanagement to replace  undeveloped reserves when the cycle is down. It really needs a serious activist investor to intervene over that point considering the long term.. Unfortunately, in this era of shale generating a positive net cash flow is more important than reserve replacement. Personally, I think dollar policy is a bigger determinate in the price of oil so I think crude will continue to slowly surge higher as long as the dollar continues to weaken.",
"My experience: oil companies that do not increase their production keep their pps flat. TGA needs to produce more oil in its leases to boost the pps. Higher prices help but 60+$ oil brings back fracking and oversupply. I like management's conservative approach. I own more shares than 3/4 of the institutions and I am hoping that TGA can boost production to 20K boepd. That will make everyone happy. If you are right that FCF alone is all that's needed, I'll post again singing your praises.",
"I basically disagree with point three asserting the major problems have been solved and with point five that ;production (IMO the major problem) is of minor concern. Increasing production is the essential factor in TGAs revival (as in all small oil producers). Exploration wells have been a major disappointment culminating in the most recent, Boraq 5. TGA in Egypt  tries to exploit lower grade structures (stratigraphic, faults) and now tight oil shale in Canada, all of which are lower volume wells, provided the oil is there which is more certain in Canadadian shale  than in the Egyptian leases. But at current prices, TGA is a speculative buy.",
Sentiment for anything oil or gas related is not good right now though that has changed a little since prices went over $55 WTI and held ...TGA has that going against it along with the Egyptian /foreign assets and then you have the Canadian assets suffering from  the wide WCS/WTI diff do to the build up in WCS inventory from the ND pipeline leak and added oil sand s production coming  on line.... looks to me like it will be a slow grind up is what we'll see.... if oil prices hold.....,
"That this company is still in existence is a testament to the management team.  This company was run conservatively, and had very little debt and lots of cash to survive the downturn in oil prices that wiped out many small E&P companies.  They also survived their primary asset in Yemen going to zero value, and the turmoil in Egypt, along with EGPC delaying paying them for produced and delivered oil.  They have shown they understand how to navigate a tricky political environment.  Now that they have diversified with the 60 million dollar purchase in Canada, the company is now completely de-risked.",
Worst case this thing goes up 50% with Brent above $55.Just loaded the boat. LONG TGA,
The executives pay themselves a smaller salary than most co's that size.  They make up for it with options priced at current market.  I prefer that as it aligns them with us the shareholders.,
"This company has management and governance issues that also need to be observed. The Board of Directors is too large and expensive for a company of this size. Neither the Board or the two senior managers have bought any stock. The poor production performance has been tolerated and the CEO and COO rewarded with options, not appropriately sanctioned. There is a secular mis-alignment with the rest of the TransGlobe shareholders.",

So do you get a K1 with TGP?,
"Thanks for your well researched article J.  I have been looking more closely at the LPG market to determine how much financial friction this will create for TGP.  I'm glad you highlighted this in your report.  I'm not a 100% clear on how many of the LPG vessels are operating in spot:Skaugen Q3 2017 Report:""However, surprisingly to IMS, our subsidiary received unilateraltermination notices concerning these 6 TK vessels on 16th November2017. IMS was further informed by media releases the same day thatTGP had already established its own competing LPG/Petchem andSSLNG pool intended to operate these vessels and other Norgas poolvessels on their own, instead of through the Norgas Carriers pool.Following the termination notices, IMS and Norgas have been in theprocess of ensuring that the redelivery of these 6 TGP vessels, underthe in-charters to our subsidiary, are done in accordance with theunderlying agreements/arrangements and without creating damageto the clients of Norgas. To date, 3 out of 6 vessels on in-charter havebeen redelivered so far. The redeliveries have been performed by ourteam of professionals without any material disruption to the NorgasPool operations and/or its clients.IMS regrets this development with TGP, but respect the fact that TGPmay want to operate these, for us loss-making vessels, on their ownrather than on an operational lease to the relevant IMS subsidiary. TheLPG / Petchem transportation business is currently very challengingand scale is probably needed on the back of a much neededconsolidation for that business to again perform. By establishing anew pool TGP is, according to the media release referred to above,hopeful they alone can achieve such a consolidation""So we have these 6 vessels being redelivered.  In the TGP 2016 Annual Report, 4 LPG vessels are reported as operating in the spot market, with an additional 5 scheduled to roll of long term charters in 2017.  I didn't see any updates on the extensions of the LPG vessels, so should we assume they are all on spot now?  If so, the total number of LPG vessels trading in spot is 15.  Any thoughts?",

Financed with bank debt of 1.3B at let's say 6 per cent, preferred stock.2B at 8.5 per cent and .5B of undistributed cash flow. If correct we have additional margin of 220M and interest of about 95M . Net result is 125 M  or about 1.50 per share, .375 per quarter increase. Is this too optimistic?",
"Great article J,Very good to see the cash flow and DCF projections of TGP detailed like this. Also a great angle to see the recent declining DCF explained by the setbacks TGP had the last year. Amazing that TGP still outperformed peers this strongly over 2017, that is a first big win for you. There are dozens of articles on GLOP/DLNG due to the high yields, but nobody else seem to ever write about TGP, which is weird as it's a much larger firm with a much stronger backlog. What always amazes me is how strong people like to hold on to the status quo. If somebody writes an article on, for example, GLOP with relatively low DCF coverage and expects them to raise the distribution by 5% a year the next years, nobody seem to think anything of that. But when you have a firm with ample DCF coverage, a huge profitable growth outlook, and you make a prediction that they will 5x the distribution to start doing similarly like peers (but embedded with much longer charter backlog), then suddenly you meet scepticism.Of the companies mentioned in the article i'm long TK, TOO and TGP and Short GLOP.",

You have helped to fill a big gap in management's forward guidance.  Teekay Group management does a decent job of forecasting CVFO, but is averse to forecasting DCF, and is unwilling give guidance on future changes in dividend payouts.  You deserve a lot of credit for your ability to translate the CVFO guidance of management into reasonable DCF forecasts, and likely impacts on distributions.  All us TK and TGP longs owe you a debt of gratitude for your efforts.",
Let's also keep in mind that the FPSOs were written down to $400M carrying value when oil prices were much lower than they are now. Those assets are going to be producing huge cash flows if Brent stays close to where it is now ($67-$68). You can easily argue for a significantly higher valuation based on the current oil price. Every month Brent stays in the $60s adds value to TK.,

"By the way, I don’t think that the primary resource allocation should be done centrally. It should reside primarily in each business segment. Of course when it comes to major acquisitions, asset sales and spin outs the board should be involved. It is my hope that Flannery resists too much central planning and tasks his business leaders with product innovation, superior product support and maintenance and efficient operation. Developing the milestoned measures that can be reviewed monthly is also a priority. What to do with their central R&D labs and what return is expected for what expenditure as a function of time is also an issue to be addressed at the top. A new process that addresses how new discoveries.  initial feasibility demonstrations can be developed into new company products and/or businesses like plastics was in the past is also something that the CEO might put in their basket of tasks.",

"Don’t know what the new board members will see as their role. I think the most significant observation to make is that it is 2/3 rds the size of its predecessor and thus costs less. The Trian board member will probably wield some power in questioning costs and in the buying and/or selling of assets. Given the spotlight and criticism from the outside concerning the boad’s decisions under Immelt, I guess we can expect a more activist board. I can’t imagine however that it can impact GE’s operations significantly. The exceptions, of course, are in acquisitions and disposal of assets. Would a more discerning board have rejected the Alstom acquisition or the BHI deal. Probably not because the due diligence data presented to them seem to be favorable. This is where an activist board might demand more details and time milestoned plans for the achievement of the cost synergies and revenue assumed. Ideally, the board would then demand a monthly or quarterly update against these plans. That in fact was how one if the boards on which I served functioned. Clearly this follow up didn’t occur with GE.",
I got a buy order in at $17. GE will be a very good buy soon and pay out real rewards to those who stick their necks out far enough.,
Replied to comment above but think this stands well on its own merit and accurately reflects my feelings on GE! :If GE recovers it will still be a good buy at $20-$22. Why buy at $18?  If the stock fails have to cost average the stock to mitigate losses. Rather buy at $20-$22 and know I have a winner than buy at $18 and be stuck with a dog!  Might regret that $18 buy when GE goes to $12 or $14.,

"My experience is who and what the board does has very little effect on the company’s operations. Have been on the boards of two much smaller companies. My experience is that the board chairman pretty much runs the show and the board is not a democracy. The compensation committee has some influence, but on a complex business like GE even this impact is limited. Board members value is generally in the the contact areas. In a large international business much of their value  is in their association with those who might be important to a GE business thrust, acquisition,etc,. The relative importance of knowledgeable, committed senior managers and their staffs  to run each of their businesses is much more important. Maybe it’s just me but the above charts don’t give me a warm and dewy feeling. They smack of  generality and contain no reference to product  or  maintenance support innovation. The idea that power generation is a shrinking market seems counter intuitive, when the workd is using more and more electricity, car makers are pushing electric cars and over half the world’s population has yet to avail themselves of the modern use of electricity we take for granted in the USA.

Asian billionaire point relates purely to MU as an investment. Future success on the pitch depends on the quality of decision making from the owner down.   Performance during the transfer season is as critical as performance during the playing season. MU ‘s lack of a director of football to give long term stability to player acquisition at all levels from kids through to first team is a major structural weakness. The days when one man could do it all have gone. ( even if you could find another like SAF),
Premier league football is loved by media companies around the world and the rise in value of the TV rights domestically and globally looks set to run and run.However...  Those television revenues go to all 20 EPL teams collectively in contrast to Spain for example where Real Madrid and Barcelona have been able to do individual deals for many years.Moreover the arrival of money no object owners at Chelsea and Manchester City coupled with the rise of Tottenham over the last three years mean that Manchester United Liverpool and Arsenal no longer have an easy route into the European Champions league.  There are now six strong clubs fighting for four positions. Being in or out of the Champions league is highly significant for commercial income and player attraction.In addition the transfer price and wages for world class talent has escalated out of all recognition in the last year following PSG’s signing of Neymar .Moreover following the retirement of Alex Ferguson and his CEO David Gill the ability of MU to compete effectively for world class talent in the transfer market has been undermined by the churn at Manager/ Coach  level and a lack of football expertise further up the clubs hierarchy. So whilst the global revenue line should keep growing along alongside the global tv rights the pressure on margins from player wages and amortisation of transfer fees is likely to grow faster. Growing profits off the pitch without commensurate success on it cannot continue indefinitely however Manchester United are one of the few global sporting super brands so the downside risk maybe covered in part at least by the trophy asset appeal to an Asian Billionaire . Short term some upside potential but definitely not one to tuck away and forget .,Risk And Opportunity In A Major Football Club
My sibling  got a sample packet of Trulance and much prefers it over the severe diarrhea he's had with Linzess. He is hoping his insurance will cover it eventually.,
What are the chances of a buy-out by a specialty pharma company looking for growth?  Maybe the change in CEO is a signal that the company isn't going to be tied to its stubborn strategy of going it alone in the future.,
"Taking the revenue projections from this article and projecting a flat spend rate of $200M/year, plus some additional interest expense (10% of accumulated debt), I compute that the company will earn $0.34, $1.01 and $1.64 per share in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.   Using a PE of 14.5, the stock should be priced at $5.00, $14.65 and $23.78 in each of those years.  I'm thinking that my expense projections are probably high as the majority of expenses are related to sales (http://bit.ly/2Fig5Lf) and I would expect those to decline as Trulance gains momentum. Patent protection for Trulance extends through 2032 (http://bit.ly/2qIzOjW), so until something better/cheaper comes on the market, it should have a good run. I've been trying to figure out how much better, if any, Trulance is than Linzess.  I think it will be hard to get doctors to switch unless there is an advantage.  Trulance dosages are smaller and Linzess has to be taken 30 minutes before the first meal, so Trulance should be a little easier for patients to take.  This data is antecdotal, but both Linzess and Trulance are rated favorably by patients on drugs.com.  In reading through the Trulance comments, there are quite a few who experienced problems with Linzess and had switched to Trulance.  http://bit.ly/2FkrlH3http://bit.ly/2qMeZEyThe Trulance reviews that discuss switching from Linzess are consistent with SGYP's claim that 43% of Trulance users are switchers from other medications:   http://bit.ly/2Fig61L",
"I would note that in his piece here on Oct 3, when the stock was at 3.23, the author called the stock ""undervalued"" and estimated total 4Q scripts at 38,554.  Using the larger IMS numbers, the actual total is closer to 34,100.",
The only way management can boost this stock is to add 'blockchain' to the company name.,
"Having checked, I now find that for the week of 12/15/17, Linzess generated 9,347 NBRx (new scripts) according to IMS.  This is probably near an alltime high, but still not that much greater than the 8,000 new scripts they were generating weekly at the end of their first year.  Many more of these new scripts are for 90 days, since that is now their recommended initial script.  However, these new scripts are heavily discounted.  In fact, yesterday Ironwood previewed their 2017 net sales of Linzess at an estimated $700m, which seemed to disappoint the market.",
"The author compares the first three quarters of the Trulance launch with what he believes is the first quarter of the Linzess launch in 2012 and their net revenues or $19.2m.  Actually, Linzess launched in midDecember 2012 (not an auspicious time) and that $19.2m constituted pipeline filling, not actual sales.  In fact, it took all of 2013 to work off that inventory and while their script count grew robustly, their sales were virtually nil.  So this comparison is meaningless.  Also, while IRWD's inventories of Linzess dropped during their first full introductory year (as one would expect), Synergy's inventories have roughly tripled (not a good sign). The potential for this market is constantly overstated by citing the percentage of the population which experiences constipation.  Most of these people will use the OTC medications which fill an entire aisle at my CVS.  When one stops working (as they all seem to do eventually) they switch to another.  Another observation:  After about a year, these drugs seem to achieve a stable inflow of new scripts.  After a year, Linzess was generating about 8,000 new scripts a week, which is about where they've stayed ever since.  I would guess that Trulance is going to plateau at about 1,350 new scripts a week.  Ironwood was forced to spend on an expensive DTC campaign to maintain script growth after the first year, and now they are engaging in a virtual price war, offering 3 months of the lower dose 72mg formulation for $30.  Net net:  This market is not nearly as large nor as profitable as the initial ballyhoo about ""blockbuster"" Linzess suggested.",

We don’t have a susceptibility to that variant. But with Spectre, AMD is susceptible.” As Google outlined in a blog post earlier today, the Spectre flaw comes in two variants Google called Variant 1 and Variant 2 while Meltdown was Variant 3. Variant 2 was the hardest problem to resolve.  https://seekingalpha.c...",
"Seems like Intel knew about  Meltdown and Spectre before Google notify Intel.  Reports mention that when Google notified Intel, Intel told them that they were the 4th to report the security problems.  That means the Intel CEO knew even before Google notification that there were serious security problems with Intel chips..",
"Well I had forgotten this hatred for intel in the public.I'm a trader and currently using an AMD FX6300 in my PC which is great for the price.  Well this one is affected by the problem but I have a good firewall. ;-)I totally agree with the author because there was a lot of unrational speaking to attack intel those last 10 days.  It's the first prose that try to be rational.The problem concern ""speculative execution"", this technique is used in nearly every multicore processor to speed-up processing (GPU, CPU and network processor).  It is not there because it is not in the press or has not been POC.  It exist theoritically in some way in most multi core processors. Every company in the IT that build processors is concerned. The google group of white hat hackers (strangely seems they are all european like me) have only tested 3 CPU (pretty old one, because they needed a good knowledge of the CPU).  No one will test all the processors in the world to try to hack them.   Intel is about 80% of the CPU so it's an easy target.  The hack is not an easy one but hackers are getting really good nowadays (thanks google).  It is an new instance of a hack based on ""timing"".  What is clear is that Multiple core is increasing exponentially the complexity of CPU.  It is not the first time that intel has to solve this problem.Why nothing on Ryzen?  Not because it has no hole but because it is too new and no one will work hard to hack it specifically.Why nothing on GPU, they don't use ""speculative execution""?This remind me of the volkswagen problem where , god knows why, everyone was believing they were the only cheater.Now on a trading pov you have to really understand that CPU is something of the past for intel.  The future is FPGA, DRAM, 3D NAND, car self driving.  Do you really think the world will stop selling intel CPU because of this hack?  Do you really think intel will have to replace all his CPU because of a feature (I won't call it a bug because it is a malicious used of a feature).  And well if you think a bug is something unacceptable, then you are not an it guy, you're a ""mundane"" that has never work with complexity.",

AMD has not been forthcoming ( read honest) in explaining how their architecture ( bios) is different from Intel's. AMD is trying to distance itself from the the rest as a marketing strategy. Understandable but pathetic!!!,
There is a reason meltdown is called meltdown and spectre is called spectre. The author is trying to downplay this. Meltdown causes a literal meltdown of function. Spectre doesn’t. Intel is affected by Meltdown and AMD is not. Intel’s CEO knew this is got out all he possibly could. That should be the end of the story. This is probably why we had that random 5% AMD increase a couple weeks ago. Someone knew this was coming out. Perhaps it was the Intel CEO buying up AMD shares.,

"An email I received on Friday from MongoDB team, note 10-15% impact on VMs (Hypervisors) which are the bread and butter of the cloud.Hi xxxxxx, Recently disclosed research regarding security vulnerabilities in almost all modern processors such as Intel and AMD (CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753, and CVE-2017-5754) has prompted public and private institutions, including cloud providers, to patch OS and hypervisor infrastructures. These patches disable performance optimizing features of CPUs, and it is expected that, regardless of OS or cloud provider, all workloads will see a performance impact. We are investigating the performance implications of these patches to MongoDB on both OS kernels as well as cloud hypervisors. Hypervisor Patch Impact As a result of the patches applied by AWS between January 3rd and January 5th, 2017, we have observed the following:•	For high-load benchmarks (e.g. YCSB) we measured a 10-15% impact on throughput with some exceptional cases that are still being studied. •	We believe these results are consistent with other industry research. •	We will release additional results (including additional cloud providers) in the coming days.Kernel Patch Impact This is the impact that customers can expect to see when they apply the recommended patches to their cloud VMs or on-premises hardware:•	At this time we have not seen a substantial signal (either better or worse) on major distributions such as Amazon Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Ubuntu. •	Based on the industry research we expect that there will be some measurable performance impact (although yet to be quantified).•	We will have additional results made available in the coming days.",

They have not explicitly said this because the announcement implicated all processors (and I am rightly or wrongly suspecting it may have been on purpose).  They had a long time to wordsmith the announcement and the announcement was not really Googles alone.  It was a collaboration.

"Most notably, AMD claims that is has zero vulnerability to Variant 3 (Meltdown), stating that the patches that are currently being issued for Meltdown do not apply to its processors due to ""architectural differences."" This is excellent news for AMD, as it therefore has no exposure to the current round of potentially performance-sapping patches. That bodes very well for the company as it reenters the data center with a competitive line of EPYC processors.The Ryzen desktop processors are also not susceptible to Meltdown. Linus Torvalds has also granted AMD an exemption to the performance penalties incurred by the Linux patch for Meltdown. (From Toms Hardware.com)  Three variants you only mention two and the one you do not mention is the most crippling to Intel processors.  Learn something about tech before you post your gibberish.  In order to protect against variant 3 Intel processors take a major hit in performance while AMD does not.  This is because Intel has to disable how some of its how its CPU operates.  Intel does not authenticate between page files in the cache AMD does.",

I added more at $44.12 last week. Bottom line for me is that the list of those affected reads like a who's who of tech companies. Those represent a LOT of resources which will go towards solutions.Maybe this one will be different but I've become somewhat immune to security threats to tech - it's part of the environment now. I didn't sell MSFT last year when the threats to older OS came out and not selling these companies now.,

"Perhaps ... but isn't there also some reputational (and prestige) damage here for INTC, regardless of whether the performance impact is 0%, 5% or 30% ?It's all very well to say ""these issues (to some degree) affects all cpus, it's not just us guys"", but that's not a great message if you spent decades as the dominant and best cpu company. ""Their issues are nearly as bad as ours"" isn't leadership.",
So you are putting all processor manufacturers at the same level of vulnerability. Then saying it is very difficult to scope it. How about at least trust what the individual companies announced? At least they are liable for what they say.,

Sure, they can do that, but it's not worth much.”  It’s not worth much to pay MP on a per-seat-fill basis?  You should stick to rocket building.

"A really stupid article - claiming that Tesla will have an advanateg come loss of tax credits day has to be the dumbest lie I've ever heard : while Tesla may not suffer from loss of credits against GM, which will also lose their credits at about the same time, there are more than two dozen automakers out there who have announced well over 120 eletri models coming to market in the next several years and ALL of them have their full 200,000 tax credit units available - giving them a tremendous price advantage against GM and Tesla. GM would be really stupid to produce enormous numbers of electric cars facing that kind of price disadvantage, a factor that this braindead article fails to understand. Fortunately GM is run by professionals who understand the EV business (which they have been involved in longer than Tesla Motors). Any fool can see that while GM's electric car sales will suffer a tremendous price disadvantage while its competitiors still have tax credits available, at least GM can still sell gas powered cars competitively , while Tesla will feel the full brunt of the price disadvantages: they can only sell electrics.And, apparently, the fool who wrote this article is totally unaware of charging stations and protocols. ALL of the world's automakers (except Tesla) already use the CCS charging standard or soon will swittch from CHAdeMO to CCS.The CCS protocol is far faster than the Tesla Superchargers (140KW) - the CCS has 350KW and 500KW charging capabilities. Another stupidity committed by this clueless article is that it expects GM to build a charging network. THAT  suggestion disqualifies this author as a person who should be given a mouthpiece. Since every single automaker will use the CCS protocol, why does this authorthink that any automaker needs to do anything? EvGo is right now installing coast to coast CCS charging stations with 350KW chargers, which can handle twice as many electrics as a Tesla Supercharger can. And oil companies are also buying up charging companies toinstall chargers in their gas stations, which can be done very quickly, with all of the accessories that  sparsely distributed Tesla stations are sorely lacking - restrooms, restaurants, etc. The purpose of an automaker is to build cars, not refueling stations. Tesla made a huge mistake by its greedy attempt to establish a charging monopoly - now they are paying for it - Tesla vehicles are banned from their supercharger stations if they are used in any commercial fashion. That is just plain fraud, in addition to being exceedingly stupid. It also shows just how strained the Supercharger network is getting, and the Model 3 has not yet even begun to populate the highways.",
"Why did GM sell another 2,125 Bolts in Canada, where there were no ZEV credits to be had?",
Then maybe that car isn't for them just yet. Still lots of sales to be had from homeowners or those who have access to their own power source. The plan is that charging stations will not only expand in numbers but so will rate of charge in the future. The infrastructure can't come in one fell swoop but I am pretty sure Tesla will expand demand as they can.,
"Did the author get paid by Musk for this article? To think there is an ALL electric future in the near to mid term future is ridiculous. First and foremost you need many affordable electrics WITHOUT the tax incentive - which is going away under the new tax plan... Second you need an infrastructure to support FAST electric recharging - that means recharging stations as plentiful as gas stations - and charging reasonable prices to recharge, along with getting it done in less than 10 minuets (now takes several hours in many cases) - Third, the price of both oil and natural gas has to skyrocket to make electric even look good from a energy standpoint - which ironically btw the utilities that supply the electricity use oil, natural gas and coal... nuclear is less than 25% of USA output and likely to go down, not up, because of so much regulation in the past; and it takes at least ten years to bring new nuclear plants online. Having said that, I like electric in that they are quiet and have very good 0-60 speeds... they are useful for city living... if you don't plan on traveling outside the city and keep within short distances from your home and a recharge... But the bottom line is that electrics ARE NOT going to dominate the future in the USA... maybe they will in other markets like Europe or parts of China (China is a huge country and has the same issues as the USA)... So GM has a good balance and is not starry eyed and predicting that all electric future... I believe that if the USA does move from oil in a big way, it will go to natural gas first, before it goes to electric - especially in long haul vehicles. Just my two cents - but dreamers don't make money in the end - however if they are good snake oil salesmen they can boost their stock price, for a bit.",

"Tesla 3's will sell for the cachet now (they certainly aren't selling on build quality).  What is fundamentally better at 35K ? Tesla 3's for 35K and lose money on every sale (that don't actually exist) or an Audi A4.  I live in a apartment, I drive less than 10K miles a year.  Why on earth (earth excluded) would I choose a Model 3 that I have to purchase vs an A4 that I can lease other than to impress others?? By the time I am ready to buy an electric car Audi will have that A4 in an all electric version or plug in hybrid which would suit most my needs as a city driver. Plus I will have dozens of other choices. Those people who buy Tesla 3's are will be killing themselves to get the new ""I Phone"" five years from now and probably less.

"My wife's Chevy Equinox motor was replaced on warrenty in the summer because the cylinders drew all the oil into combustion chamber. That's what 100 years of ICE tech still gets you and we've thrown way more money at Chevy than Tesla. The Tesla model of producing and using energy is fundamentally better once the system is in place. The friction comes from the system not being complete and the costs are too high. The costs are going down yearly on solar and on battery and have no reason to stop anytime soon. By the time it's cheaper than gas the investment opportunity will have decreased drastically. The bet is on the trend lines continuing as they are, not where they're at. Tesla is funded because it's what the investors want, and it's a bet.",

Why be all in on a technology that hasn't been proven that everyone wants.  Tesla bulls continually disregard GM,Ford, VW, BMW ,Mercedes as unable to compete with them for EV cars which is delusional. What GM learns from the Bolt will enable them to apply this technology when they deem it necessary in the market. These companies have awesome engineers like Tesla.  They also have tons of money behind them.  They are also not stupid either, they will come to the market and compete when they are ready and more importantly willing and feel they need to.  People like new things and Tesla is it right now for some but being the first to market didn't make Nokia the winner in the end.  The most delusional part of Tesla bears is they compare Tesla vs The Bolt and not Tesla vs GM as if GM should put all their money into EVs and disregard the Billions they make selling Silverados. They also know that someone will likely have better battery making capabilities in the future and Tesla will be locked in to their Gigafactory while they have the flexibility to use the best technology that will be out there.Lastly supercharging is overrated.

"Kind of odd to compare apples and oranges between the companies, instead of overall profitability, market share, etc. Besides the Bolt was targeting a different market sector than the Tesla S. The Model 3 is woefully underperforming thanks to Tesla being bad at manufacturing their cars in a large enough volume. And they're definitely losing those sales to GM.

Note tightly clustered top five EV makers total sales for 2017:  27,000-23,349.

By the way, nobody in the car business, except for Musk, tries to build their own fueling infrastructure. That should fall to others who can make a profit selling fuel (electrons in this case). His charging stations can’t stand on their own financially. TSLA doesn’t help by making the charging infrastructure proprietary and having no way to monetize that investment with ALL BEV users. Musk’s model depends way too much on Other People’s Money.",
"VA, there is no such thing as an ""all electric future"". It would be foolish of GM or anyone else to commit to this. There is a simple fact of physics: The closer to the point of consumption that energy is generated (actually, converted) the more efficient. Generating power at a far off (for most Americans) power plant and transmitting it to a battery is inherently inefficient. Electric will be part of a mix of transportation options that will include fuel cells and, yes, some form of ICE. I suspect that you live in California and have never cruised the nearly endless miles of open interstates and secondary roads in the middle of the country. Pure electric can never work there. I am very much in favor of reducing carbon consumption (therefore output) and think there are many ways to achieve this. Your personal agenda has always been to promote Tesla. I don't know if this is simply out of your pure convictions, your desire to make money on your own investments, or some other incentive to promote Tesla.

GM will be producing a full line of EVs, AVs in the very near future and continue to produce all the other PROFITABLE vehicles in it's line, including the all new truck. Meanwhile, Tesla continues to burn cash in huge piles, those losses piling up with each vehicle it produces. It's very existence is now in real doubt as it may no longer be able to get away with massive dilution of it's 'investors.' 14 years and the losses continue unabated. The beautiful model S is too expensive to ever be a mass market seller, the hilariously overpriced Model X, the first non-SUV as it is anything but sporty, useLESS because of it's laughable and needless falcon wing doors preventing a roof rack for skis, boards or luggage rack but hey, it IS a vehicle. Then there's the Model 3, a pretty good knock off of my 2nd gen Volt with nicer wheels. When they come to market, swowly, vewy vewy swowly, they will be 50k with no rebate. Instead of waiting a couple of years, I bought my Volt, got a discount AND a tax credit, my net cost was $21k. Now have 19k trouble free miles on it, have cut my use of gas by 90%, no range anxiety when I take long trips and with the $$$ I saved, I put a 5kWh solar system on my house so my electric is now free for both home and auto.

"I don't understand what the point of the article is.  GM's NA sales for '17 are 3 million units.  GM's EREV/EV sales for '17 are 0.044 million units, the #1 NA seller of affordable EREV/EVs by a factor of at least 2:1.  TSLA moved 0.050 million units.The stock valuation issue is the GM has funded the world's largest battery lab, and has devoted more engineering to Advanced Propulsion than any other company, a full 50% of their engineers.So they are pouring money down the toilet quicker than any other car company other than Tesla.  But GM remains profitable, with excellent sales in China, and 1% increase in market share over their rivals in NA.  They are still paying dividends.So please be more clear as to how 23k Chevrolet Bolts sold in the USA has any affect on TSLA price, because it certainly has no significant affect on GM price.NOTE:  Using Elon Musk (CEO Tesla) public marketing speeches in lieu of data is ironic since Elon has been wrong far more than right for a decade now.

"OUTRAGEOUS QUOTES FROM 12/20/17Ron Thiessen interview from yesterday, http://bit.ly/2FKcBBJ. The most egregious quotes highlighted below. Note Thiessen’s prediction for his pay day – that a mining major will buy out Northern Dynasty once they have a draft EIS. Host introduction begins at 8:45:Lots of talk about how the mine site is “in the middle of nowhere” and the potential impacts to the fishery are “false” and “lies” and EPA bashing and EPA is “no longer an issue.” “it looks more like Kansas than it does the rest of Alaska.”On fishery and location: “Bristol Bay is well-renowned for its sockeye salmon fishery. But this is a very large area, about 40, 50 thousand square miles. There’s 8 to 9 different watersheds that make up spawning and rearing habitat for the sockeye salmon and … there’s about 55,000 rivers, streams, creeks, brooklets, and the like that make up all of those waterways. And Pebble is located in the extreme headwaters of two of those. And when I say ‘extreme headwaters’ – that’s so far up the line that water really only flows sparingly in spring when the snow melts. You know, in the valley that Pebble is in that snowmelt causes some running water, but none of it at summer time or at spawning season. The valley that Pebble sits in is a very, very shallow valley, 750 feet above sea level, and not a single commercial piece of timber, not a tree in fact in that valley. There’s some shrubs and lichen growth, mainly what we call ‘shattered rock’ and it’s kind of the ideal location for a mineral resource project. It’s out there in the middle of, you know, there’s nothing really around. There’s no people living in the deposit site, there’s no people living near that valley. The closest community is about 20 miles away. And even in all of western Alaska that 40 to 50 thousand square miles, there’s about 7500 people in total living the area. Most of them live on the coast. The largest community is 2500 people, Dillingham, and the smallest is probably about 25 people, places like say Pedro Bay.”Community relations: “During our exploration phase, during the spending of that $750 million, we were functionally the largest employer in western Alaska and we were giving people fulltime jobs during that timeframe and showing them what the opportunity that existed is. … Really all these villages are looking for some business opportunities and you’re in a region where there is literally nothing, there is no business in the area around Pebble.”Exploration impacts: “We’ve reclaimed every drill site… you can’t see any, other than the buildings we’ve left there that we stored some gear in, you can’t see that there’s a million feet of diamond core drilling going on here.”Impacts to Fishery: “To tell you the honest truth, we will be able to do things for that fishery and for that habitat that I think will enhance the outcomes.”Mine segmentation and potential partners: When talking about fielding potential partners, joint ventures, and funders , NDM was looking for “the company with the right mindset. That really, from our perspective, the company that wanted to see this project go into permitting sooner rather than later and also bought into the concept that we need to walk before we run. That we need to build something that the region, the state, and the communities would be comfortable with… These projects are conducive to large-scale operations. The bigger you build it – you know, because almost you make the same amount of money for every unit that goes through it, so the more units that go through the plant, the more money you make – but scale has impacts and people wanna say can you manage impacts before we let you build the monster, something really, really large. And so the idea was, okay, let’s show them that we can build something that’s reasonable, it’s not optimized from a volume standpoint, but you know it’s economic, it works well, it will provide an economic interest and benefit to shareholders, to the company, to the region, to the state, to the nation, and let’s go forward with something like that. And First Quantum really bought into that.”Permitting timeline: “Filing those permits this year actually when you look at timelines that are embedded in the regulatory process, you know, if everyone adheres to the timelines then theoretically we can get this permit in three years, which is huge… We could see ourselves to a Record of Decision within three years. The big thing we want to get to is a completion of an EIS. That, I think, is very, very doable in the next three years. Maybe even the Record of Decision by that time. … The Army Corps of Engineers during that first 90 to 120 days will complete a scoping study, put out an RFP for an independent engineering company to prepare an EIS. There will be a news release around that RFP and the appointment of the independent engineer and the terms of reference for that scoping study. I mean, the EIS has been referred to by many people in the environmental community – that includes NRDC, Robert Redford, and those people that are generally opposed to resource development – they refer to the EIS as the Magna Carta of the NEPA process. So we all, both sides realize, the importance of that document. That’s the document that tells you want the environmental impact of this project will be on the environment and what will be done to mitigate those impacts and manage all of the environmental issues that arise. … A draft of that should come out in 2019 and that will be open for public comment and there will probably be a couple, three, public hearings. And then all the comments will go back and the Army Corps of Engineers and the other agencies involved will take those and sit down with the proponent, PLP, and say okay these are the changes we want made to accommodate our requirements and if you do that, then you get your ROD.”Ron Thiessen thinks someone will buy out Northern Dynasty once they have a Draft EIS: “I think a really important thing here is, there’s a very good change that Northern Dynasty itself – and I’m not making a prediction, I’m not making advice, it’s just I have a lot of experience in this. I have been through these kinds of situations many times in my life. This is my business – finding, developing assets to the point that they can be built. And typically at that juncture a major mining company comes along and wants to buy that asset and the way they buy it typically is they buy the company. Northern Dynasty is no different. And we will own 50% of the world’s arguably #1 undeveloped copper/gold project. That somebody will come a long and take us over. When will that happen? You know, probably when a Draft EIS is published and everybody – mining companies, executives, boards – look at this and realize what a normal mine can be built there. Nothing extraordinary, nothing unusual. I mean, we’ve heard stories about oh Pebble’s too expensive to build, I mean, absolutely not. It’s in an ideal location … It has so many attributes. So, that’s 2019. That’s not that far off…. That’s why First Quantum did this deal with us. They’re looking down the road saying a permitted Pebble in 2021, wow.WOW, yes indeed.  I find the read pretty entertaining. Is Ron related to Sideshow Bob?",

"Ooo.  What a lot of nasty comments after our little statements on behave of the poor and underemployed US citizens in Alaska.I guess we bumped the nest of the haters of Alaska's poor, underemployed, unemployed, cold, and hungry live, outside of Alaska.But right now, all I can hear from the 'haters' is the screams from the penthouses and windows of their nice warm offices and well maintained homes.  Here is what they are yelling:""Let them eat fish.  They don't need no stinking jobs unless those jobs are doing work on our fishing boats or at the mines and properties where we and our patrons have our money invested and at the wages we offer.""They are or work for powerful politicians and bankers.  But when the need for jobs, a build-out of infrastructure is raised, drug and alcohol issues, suicide rate increases among the young, lower educational proficiency scores for students, high unemployment among the natives Americans, statistics describing the high dependency of the population of Alaska on State and Federal aid, the State's treasury is nearly empty, and the climate is getting colder and more people are freezing, finally leaks out through the ""independent media"" sources, they will all demand 'change' and 'more Federal assistance with no strings attached.'During the election it will be the same old rants against any mineral deposits where they don't have a significant interest and control and the old ""we are here to protect the environment"" will ring from their offices in DC and in cities around the world.  Their media will blame outsiders and Trump for the problems in Alaska and the need infrastructure, control of illegal and over prescribed drugs, alcoholism, care for the elderly, treatment for depression, skills training in computer science and medical care, under employment of the fishermen and low proficiency scores of students and low HS graduation rates.But behind the board room and office doors, they will be sending out warnings which state clearly:""We are with the guys in Seattle and beyond who run this State and you will do what we say or we will let you rot in hell.

Another cheery piece involving one of your fav characters:http://bit.ly/2qWVqta,
"Mark this down, all you who constantly (if not ridiculously) wave the DD banner:Alaskan Regulation of Mine DevelopmentVarious departments and agencies in the state of Alaska are responsible for the wide-ranging permitting process which precedes the development of large mines. The following list contains just a sample of the permits, approvals, and authorizations which Northern Dynasty Minerals must receive before Pebble Mine can be brought into operation. Plan of Operations Approval Reclamation and Bonding Waste Management Permits and Bonding Water Discharge Permit Certification of ACOE Permits (old acronym, current is USACE) Sewage Treatment System Approval Air Quality Permits Fish Habitat and Fishway Permits Water Rights Right of Way/Access Tidelands Leases Dam Safety Certification Cultural Resource Protection Monitoring Plan (Surface/Groundwater/W...According to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, permits are often denied to project proponents. Alaskan agencies and departments could deny permits and approvals to Northern Dynasty Minerals. Alternatively, the state could delay the granting of key permits. Either of these actions could severely delay the completion of the project and would likely cause significant volatility in the company's share price.Please pay particular attention to the words, 'Lake Iliamna' in the future. This will be the first 'NO!' issued by the state. Now, with further diligence extrapolate the CAPEX cost to come up with another route that could be as likely denied. Everything about what this man has plainly explained is true.",
The Nak press release that I quoted the other day was released in Jan 2018...😎,
There are over TEN YEARS worth of happy horse shit essays about ND on SA. Only one of them is based on fact:https://seekingalpha.c...Page after page of Pavlovian punter didlings. I suggest y'all read it again because it portends the future of NAK.,
Mining and a better way of life? LMFAO,
Another stellar day for Nak. Money. Down. The. Drain.   Stay tuned for the big dilution.,
"No!  The truth and facts need to be repeated to counter malicious propaganda and outright lies by opponents to the Pebble project.As I have said before, some mines in the area which are finally nearing the time when they will get permits to start construction will need a lot of resources quickly and if there is competition for this support (equipment, manpower and woman power, fuel, etc.).  This competition will be beneficial for Alaskans, resulting in higher wages, health benefits, and assistance to the communities from which they will seek these employees.With the expansion of the economic base will come the construction of an infrastructure which can support continued development and lower prices for food, fuel, energy, etc.The demand for locally skilled and well educated people will increase as this economy expands to support mining, construction, and who knows how many more industries.  Manufacturing may begin to startup here since Alaska is close to Asia, an enormous market place for all kinds of products, liquefied natural gas, heavy equipment, minerals, oil, coal, etc.  Opening the door to progress can turn Alaska into state which provides hope for its citizens now and in the future, where welfare checks are not a principle source of income for many of its citizens and local, not foreign workers will be the source of skilled employees and where Alaska's entrepreneurs can finally achieve their dreams.     Trying jumping on the band wagon to help promote mining in Alaska and the creation of good paying jobs for Alaskans who can benefit from the mineral wealth Alaska has to offer.NG, THM, NAK, etc. all can work together to help provide training and education for a new Alaska, based on mining and a better way of life.Why stop a discussion which is aimed at improving the economy of Alaska and it underemployed citizens?",
Plenty of alacrity in these comments.  Probably said enough for the time being.  Let's see what happens now in the near future and forget about speculation.  There are other great things happening in Alaska:  Donlin Gulch?,
"Etcm,Good find!!",
"Oprah?? LOL.  She is not stupid and won't run.After the mine is approved and begins operating, the salmon could begin to recover from the pressure imposed on their species by the current overfishing and illegal fishing by the voters of a stronger economy in Alaska.  A stronger economic base and higher employment could support new, tougher enforcement of new, more restrictive regulation of the fishing industry and severe punishment for violators. You will always have people seeking power over others and personal enrichment to play the part of defenders of the environment, jobs, fish, children and the elderly, while actually promoting direct harm and producing false and misdirected reports of successes via their media friends.Blackberry Limited (BB) was declared dead for years, but those who did their DD knew the value of BB's strengths and future value and did not sell their stock at $7.00 and now it is moving towards $15.Pebble will succeed and those who do not invest will regret listening to malicious propaganda directed against the mine and mine management.",

Using today' price of copper, gold, silver and molybdenum, this mine can produce revenue of around $1.5 Billion per year for at least 20 years (could be 40 years or more). So, I think it could be pretty attractive for the majors to eye one this project even before FQ finalized the option agreement.",

Will never be worth anything....because it will never be funded and the vast majority of people in the region are against the mine including the Native Corporation that owns the land.... Its all fantasy that this project will ever come to fruition....as many time as it has risen from the dead...it is still dead!,
"Great article Paul!New valuations will be coming from other analysts.Valuation and permit time frames that are running around the investment letters and bulletin boards are too long a timeframe and too low valuation.First, Scott Pruitt stated that the permitting process will be 6 months long starting the end of 2018.  That puts our permitting time line at 6 months best case and 18 months worst case.  There is an argument for NAK to be fast tracked now; since, they were held up 4 years by the EPA's illegal Veto already.  So, I am hoping for a permit this year not three years from now which is continuously used as a timeline.  This will move all timelines up 2 years!Now for valuation.  Most articles and analysts are incorrectly valuing Pebble at $1.5 Billion.  That is half of the Pebble project that First Quantum has an option to buy.  So, 100 percent of the mine value is really twice that at $3 Billion.Many analylist are using the 50% value to figure share price targets; so, you need to double those.  Cantor Fitzgerald just raised their target to $ 4.75.  Two others list $4.71 as an average target.  You have raised your target to $7.50 which is more inline with the NDM website which lists $9.40 as their share price for the development stage average with a high of $20 with a permit in hand.  I came up with a current value of $3 Billion with a price target of $9.20.If there is another major offer to buyout Pebble, I look for $4.5 Billion and $15 target price to $6 Billion with a $20 target price.  Cantor Fitzgerald listed a buyout value of $18.50 with 100,000 tpd vice the 160,000 tpd  submitted in the Pebble permit application.Note that copper has gone up over 20 percent since that article was written.  The Copper Super Bull market just kicked off and is headed to $4.50 on top of the increased throughput numbers.   So, all analysts need to raise their targets just like you did!  All prices are in USD for NAK.2018 should be a great year to be invested in Northern Dynasty Minerals!",

When this mine has lost not one, but two partners, a 'framework' deal is worth nothing more than the $37.5m that was put in so far, at least to investors that decide whether this goes up or continues to flounder.  Every retail investor is welcome to believe that this worth more, but until this deal (or another partner deal) is actually SIGNED, the share price won't get there.  I am bullish this stock but these articles that spread false hope and actual misinformation are actually hurting this stock in the long run.

There is a very real possibility that any amended reorganization plan that includes the Ad Hoc noteholder group could give current SDRL shareholders nada or at the very most a tiny amount of out-of the-money warrants. Many unsecured creditors are not in the mood to ""gift"" to SDRL shareholders-which is one reason they formed an ad hoc group.Other SA writers, who I respect, have estimated recovery under the current plan of about $0.05 per SDRL share. Oddly, there is absolutely no mention of the BK process in the above article--BTW-hearing on disclosure statement was reset to Feb 1 from Jan 10 because the Ad Hoc group did deposit 10% ---yet no mention in the above article.

one last tidbit. the fact that seagate management has not commented means for me that they feel it is better for the stock price to benefit upward from XRP rumour than be lowered from XRP fact.,
"i was under the assumption the two CEO's owned 61% of XRP. I do not think the investors get XRP as it was a non existent asset in 2015.  Plus the liquidity is a big issue.Ripple XRP is not a cryptocoin, it is a token that could be used on Ripple's centralized network which is the anti-thesis of blockchain.  so this is not even a blockchain play.Ripple is up because the masses saw a penny currency that supposedly was being used by some fortune 500's.  Not true, but that drove the 30,000% increase.  From a greed perspective I screwed up as everyone was telling me to buy ripple a while back. But my morality stole my profit opportunity as I could not see where this was like bitcoin or etherium in any way shape or form so i declined to participate.Stay away from ripple.  it is a cash MESSAGING system for Asian money transfers that supposedly is better than SWIFT.  It's original CEO purposely made sure investors new that XRP was a token and nothing more.  The new CEO is a snake oil salesman and he wants the world to know that XRP is better than bitcoin.  And, he is going to protect you from dilution by the massive 100 billion XRP float by escrowing all remaining and only releasing 1 billion a year.  Oh, and he and the ex CEO own 61% of all XRP.But that said, with today's mania, nothing to stop this foolishness from driving seagates price way up.  short term play and i mean short term.",

"The Seagate investment in Ripple Labs has been well known for quite some time but it took until yesterday for analysts to bring this issue to investors' attention.That said, while STX owns a small equity stake in Ripple Labs, it isn't directly entitled to any of the XRP cryptocurrency which has gained more than 1,000% over the past few weeks.With no chance to monetize this investment quickly or at all, investors should dampen their enthusiasm for the time being.",

"I just wanted to come back to this Article this evening and congratulate the Author on one of the most timely and actionable articles SA has put out in a long time. I was already an owner in STX but I knew nothing about the Ripple Investment. Seeing STX jump from $43 to $50 at the Open this morning got my attention to look at STX articles and news briefs. After reading the Author’s Article and doing a little due diligence I managed to catch 500 shares of STX this afternoon. The stock had backed off from almost $50 and $46 seemed like a good entry point based upon the information at hand. The stock is over $47 in AfterHours and I like the Gap created between $46 and $50 on 5 Times the normal volume. My only regret today was that I should have bought more in hindsight. After reading all of the above Posts (comments), it appears maybe I was the only adventurous investor on this thread to purchase shares. I really think the Author provided a great, actionable article and I look forward to where this might lead.Wishing The Author Well!",
Fantastic article ValueStreet!,
You can also own Ripple Labs through SBI HOLDINGS a Japaneese Bank 6 billion USD market cap which bought 6.25% to 10% of Ripple Labs and established a joint venture SBI Ripple Asia owning 60% of that business. Trades in Tokyo TYO:8473 and otc SBHGF http://bit.ly/2qIEg2b,

Think it could be the best play but would like confirmation of all of the ownership stakes at some point.",
"Great trade idea, exposure to ripple but through a name you can trust, STX. Thanks ValueStreet Research!",
"It's insane to value the 60% of XRP currently owned by Ripple Labs at ~$150 Billion just because some Korean and Japanese gamblers are trading a small portion XRP for $1 - $4/ piece.I actually like what Ripple Labs is doing, and think it has a lot of potential but this valuation has nothing to do with reality.Seagate has no access to the 61 billion XRP Ripple Labs is holding and slowly releasing from escrow.  They own 2-4% of the privately held company.  It's hard to imagine that Ripple Labs is worth $7.8 billion let alone $183 billion.  That's more than Disney.",
"Do they own equity in the Ripple company, or in Ripple currency?  Or both?",
"So far neither STX or Ripple Labs are willing to verify whether STX still owns their stake in Ripple Labs and if so, how much equity they acquired in A and B rounds in 2015 and 2016. However, given the nature of venture investing and relative illiquidity of private equity, plus the stodgy corporate culture at Seagate (they are more of a tortoise variety than a rabbit), and given that Seagate’s motivation was to learn more about blockchain for potential future transactional use, it might be a safe assumption that Seagate has not sold their shares. If they had, and if they had recently, the gains wld be too large to not disclose publicly. Even if they only own 1/3 of the equity which Value Street Research guesses they own.",
"Just bought shares in STX because I like the 5.9% dividend and I already had shares purchased at $32 from last year. I like the “rumor” and where there is smoke there is fire. I read the article from 2015 saying that they had been part of Ripple purchase, and I can’t find anything saying they have sold it, so buying shares at $46 right now is a lot better than paying $49.70 earlier this morning. GO STX! I would be a buyer right now at $46 and I put my money where my mouth is!",
"Hope the company issues a clarification soon to avoid speculations... Would be great if they owned a valuable stake. Yet, how would they be monetizing it?",
Interesting article/info.....and a very interesting start for STX at the open this morning!!,
"Wish this article came out after the open. I own the stock and was about to take a large options position this morning. From the research I did over the weekend the series A gave Ripple a 100m valuation and 28-32% was invested, while I couldn't get an exact number, it appeared that STX bought in to 4-5% of the Series A, I wasn't sure if the Series B was to keep that position or would give them an additional 3%. Either way this clearly was not priced in to the STX as the Ripple stake was almost 100% of STXs valuation.",
"It's been known for a while that seagate owns a stake in ripple labs. There's no announcement whether they've sold their stake, but highly unlikely given the time period that's passed and no major changes.Here's an announcement by Ripple Labs themselves back in May 2015 http://bit.ly/2qJfNtU",

"Ray, your article states that “Wells Fargo has $1.3 billion in deposits.” I’m I reading this correctly? I ask because it seems very low given the bank’s size.",
"Ray Merola: So, do you think that WFC is done defrauding its very customers, using its various nefarious schemes ?  That is always on the back burner of my mind.  I simply do not trust the people running this outfit.  Any thoughts on this ?  Is there yet another shoe to drop ?",
"Ray-Thanks for your reply. Yes, over the past 12 quarters Wells only missed estimates once. Revenues on the other hand are in steady decline. Overall loan generation is in steady decline as well. From what I recall NII / NIM are not offsetting enough to move the needle. We will get granularity Friday though. As a side note, I can tell you that the WIM division (Wealth and Investment Management), particularly Wells Fargo Advisors, has lost more than 5% of it's revenue producing sales force since the initial scandal in September of 2016. I don't know of a happy broker there actually. WIM's turnstile of management too has taken it's toll and lost credibility. Also, there was a recent blurb since last quarter's release of a forex rigging / scheme of some sort. Multiple departments were cleaned out in major cities and WF Securities jettisoned most of the forex and currency business. The Private Bank office in the old Chicago Merc building is an absolute ghost town. Management was suspended and on leave for a scandal back in April - there was a Crain's Chicago Business article published about it.In summary, I think we all need to take a deeper look into the loan portfolio to get a better sense of:- asset classes- credit quality- industry / segment concentrations- sensitivity to 25 bps hikes and overall effect on $ net income and EPS Curious to hear your thoughts on Friday's report. Thanks again.Jeff",
"Ray,Let me first say that I'm a fan of your articles, especially your analysis on Royal Dutch Shell and the oil business as a whole over the years. I hate to do this, but I have to disagree heavily with your synopsis on WFC. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a former employee of WFA (wealth management arm) and often take bearish positions with put options. In fact, we're getting close here for another one.I see your case, as is for all banks, for NII / NIM expansion with the Fed amidst its rate hike cycle and believe Fed rate hikes and the fact that oil prices trade far above domestic producer breakevens are the absolute only reasons the stock is not floundering at $50.Wells has a TON of debt and syndicated loans from the E&P and Pipeline sectors on its books. In addition, keep in mind the mounting heaping pile of cow dung in other bad debt to which Wells remains exposed. Hint, what bank is: a top 2 subprime auto loan lender? has the largest exposure to privatized student loans? offers 3% down mortgages? Uncle Warren also trimmed his position last quarter. I thought this was incredibly symbolic. At the very same time, he was chirping the tone of BAC and USB. On valuation..Given the steadily increasing defaults in their overall consumer loan portfolio, I don't see how anyone could value the stock on an EPS basis and nor do I trust management to deliver accurate and fully substantiated EPS projections to company shareholders. I know you didn't mention Price to Book as a valuation metric, but do you honestly think what's left of the forever destroyed franchise is worth a Price/Book of 1.7x? At 1.7x, if I must own a bank, I am buying JPM with both hands, feet and Trump's big(ger) button. Anyway, thanks for reading and would love to discuss more. As always, keep up the great stuff.Take care,Jeff",
"Thanks for the quality article as usual Ray.As you state, BAC is the poster child for a ""bad bank"" and look where they are.  People assign too much of a personal association with a non-personal entity.The area where most of the issues occurred was the retail bank.  While WFC is more of a retail bank than the other 3 TBTF's, it still doesn't make its money with small individual retail customers.  If it lost large commercial accounts or large ""wealth"" accounts, that might hurt the bank longer term.  Their current issues will result in fines and some period of reputational hits, but a few years from now this won't even be seen in the rear view window.Profits will not take a long term hit.  They will increase from the macro environment, the rate curve and tax reform.  Profits drive stock price over the long term.If one doesn't want to invest because of their own ""value system"" (no pun intended), that is their choice.  It is not an investment decision though, it is a personal one.  (Personally, I won't buy tobacco stocks, but that isn't an investment decision.  It's a personal one).BAC is my largest holding by far (with a single digit cost basis) and I increased my WFC holdings significantly back in Aug to the point it is my 9th largest holding (out of about 30 in my portfolio).  These are long term holdings.  The question to be asked is whether the actions causing the drop were fatal of not?  If not, the market doesn't have that long of a memory and if you can recover because of your products or services, these are buying opportunities.Best,Bob",
"Ray,As usual a very well presented case. I agree that there is a future. But I didn't want to wait. I sold last Nov @ 53 (bought @ 50). I think the wounds will heal. But I took the WFC and went into BAC @ 25. So other than wishing WFC had done better, I don't really miss it.As long as the lawsuits against executives are still out there. People won't likely completely forget about account manipulation.",
"Here are my concerns with WFC: 1.) is management any good? After listening to Sloan for 14 months I am not sure and that is not good. 2.) elevated expenses; management will not commit to firm targets as to when expenses will be coming down so it will likely be pushed to 2019 or later 3.) EPS flat for the past 4 years... really? Especially concerning Given all the stock buybacks. 4.) share awards as part of compensation run about 3% per year (of stock outstanding) which destroys more than 50% of benefit of announced share repurchases... looks to me like management compensation plans were built when WFC was best of breed and shareholders are now stuck with it. Having said all the above, I do think WFC will figure things out in the next year or two.",

And they used to have such a squeaky clean reputation.The only bank stock in my portfolio is JP Morgan which I have owned for many years.But I would consider buying Wells Fargo, Toronto Dominion, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of the Ozarks if I could pick them up at an attractive price.",
"Hi, thanks for the article, I appreciate the point of view.I don't disagree with your analysis. But I do think WFC has lost some of the magic once associated with its name. I haven't looked this up, but I'm pretty sure, on a pre cross-selling crisis basis, WFC once boasted a premium multiple vs its peers. I think your 'D' student starting to make some 'C' grades is a good way of framing things. To me, though, I think this name has lost its edge. Hard for me to think this bank will not receive extra regulatory scrutiny for some time to come. That said, I do agree 2018 should be a very good year for banks, and on a 'by the numbers' basis, WFC should do OK. But I think much the same could be said about other banks, particularly regionals, who will have many, if not the same, macro-positives at their backs that WFC does, without having to work with the stained reputation of WFC.Best of luck to all.",

"And, thanks, Ray, for another terrific article. I completely agree with your assessment.WFC has a lot going for it, including many captive markets across the West. Consider, they are the only national bank with a presence in many western resorts (like Steamboat Springs, CO), which drives a lot of folks to establish banking relations just so they have bank access during extended summer, winter or retirement stays. WFC will do just fine in the coming years.",
"@sdavid, I don’t think I agree with your assessment about brand preservation. Just consider that even after the sensor scandals for Volkswagen, they remain near the top of the sales heap. The consumer doesn’t care about such scandals, never really learn about them in the first place or they only remember the last 30 second spot they saw on TV. Maybe all three... In a few years, the recent issues will be a distant memory, only discussed on sites like this, where people pay attention. And, then, weakness like in the past year will be viewed as having been a buying opportunity.",

Congress or should I say the republicans in Congress just piled $1.4 trillion dollars of new debt with their tax plan which is going to back fire even worse than they anticipated as blue states make defensive moves against their pain.  We are very likely to see either a government shut down, a continuing spending resolution at current rates with deportation of the DOCA citizens, or a cave in to pile up even more debt building infra structure and a border wall.  Career politicians from both parties have built this debt up over the years pretending they would grow out of it.  Interest rates will rise and this debt will be unsustainable.  Many conservative republicans are rooting for this as an excuse to finally cut entitlements which will end the existence of the country as we know it and throw us back to an error of wealthy ruling class and loyal peons.","Wells Fargo: Down, But Not Out"

Today, I'm showing CFG, OZK, MCB, HOMB, and SASR trading below intrinsic value while CSFL, VLY, UBSI, and ZION are trading above.  CFG and OZK have the highest IV / Price ratio.  OZK has the better normalized ROE of the two - by far -  but CFG is presently more under-valued.   In your feedback dialogue you mentioned you owned CFG and I congratulate you on that purchase.   Thank you for a fine article.",
Than you for your great informative responses. I have been adding to $HOMB this week and have started a position in $OZRK. You got me thinking about amazon with your $SASR comment. $OZRK seems to be a best of breed with a good presence in Atlanta and surrounding areas. Atlanta seems to be a top area for amazon to land. I since your comment I have put together a list of regionals where amazon could land. Thank you for your insight.,
HiHow do you evaluate a regional bank for Valuation?What metrics do you consider?As all seem to have high P/E's or P/B or PEG or dividend is sub2% range?Can you direct us for being able to assess their valuation so we could assess them on our own?Thanks again for your valuable insights.,
"$CSFL has been ripping off the technical breakout. Yesterday's volume was massive, not sure if that is just traders... $HOMB really hung in there in that sell off. Had to buy some $BX yesterday as well. I check the $VLY from Cramer and it concerned me that it seemed like they were concerned about philly and thankful they had business in Florida I could have misunderstood though.",
"Thank you greatly again. Another regional question. I am putting together a basket of them which currently include $HOMB, $CSFL and $CFG. I think I am now going to pull the trigger on $UBSI. Strong earnings, good numbers. Thoughts? Also if there are other regionals you recommend. Thank you!",
"Thank you again on your thorough response. Thoughts on the banking deregulation bill that would raise the systemically important financial institution asset threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion? Does this effect the regionals we have discussed? I know $CFG will benefit, but how about the $HOMBs and $CSFLs ?",
"I didn't think of where new amazon headquarters would be, that could be a big catalyst. Thank you for that input. I had a response from a poster saying homb was very expensive. Do you believe that to be true? It's hard for me to look at the #s and ratios because they seem skewed after the stonegate acquisition. They have all come down, while Price to book /tangible book/PE has come up...",
"I greatly appreciate your input. Optimum bank looks to be struggling. There's a bank I have been eyeing that caught my attention when a 375,000 block went through midday a few weeks ago at 41.25. The bank is $SASR sandy corp in the Washington DC and Maryland area. Looking over fundamentals they seem to be strong and efficient. Thoughts? Thank you.",
"Any idea what bank $HOMB was close to acquiring very recently, but was pulled? CEO was talking about it on the most recent CC and they were really close. Have been waiting on it for a long time, and thinks it will come back to the table. Analyst said he thought he knew which one they were talking about...",
"I was watching the interview with Johnny Allison, CEO of $HOMB. In the interview he said he runs close with several of the large regionals who have separated from the pack and not to be surprised if there was a merger of equal parts with them. First bank that comes to my mind is $OZRK. In all the right locations for a mega merger with $HOMB. $CSFL would then be on the list of being gobbled. Next 3 years should be very exciting in the regional world.",
HIis it better to have position in individual reginal banks vs an index for regional banks?If so what would you suggest and why?I understand you are long in CFG. Any other would you put your money in at this stage?Thanks for the detailed article and expands on how to evaluate the reginal banks.,
Very solid work -- thank you for calling my attention to a sector I had neglected. Just one question: any thoughts on Zions Bancorporation?,
"Yep, and OZRK is the best IMO.",
How would MCB fit the model?,

"there is no basic math to the valuation as one of the comments above suggests.  pure revenue growth is not a sufficient valuation tool.  Their cost structure is not favorable given the extremely high cost and high risk to producing content--it is a low return business the majority of the time.  The rate of growth of subs will no doubt decline as competition in OTT offerings explodes and NFLX loses all of the quality outside provider content--simple.  The market actually does not understand that yet, but it will.  Just as the market eventually figured out that AOL and YHOO were just browsers in 2000 as they started their painful decline in value.  I am not running out of time.  It is actually the longs who should feel a sense of urgency to get out of this stock while they are benefiting from the gift of NFLX being awarded a $100 Bill market cap in the short term as it has.  I remember when AOL was supposedly worth $100 Bill (Time Warner takeover).  It ended up getting sold to Verizon recently for $4 Bill and change.  I can certainly understand all of the takeover talk.  The company should try to find someone to buy the company at these prices given the outlook.  I just don't think other media or tech companies with return hurdles and M&A discipline will make that kind of valuation mistake.",
Apple will not buy Netflix.,
"I am not worried about very short term fluctuations, I realize in the current euphoria (just like 1999), analysts (today is a good example) will continue to recommend the stock without solid fundamental valuation analysis to back up the target price.  Even today, the analyst who raised the target acknowledged that user/subscriber growth must be at very high levels to absorb the escalating content costs (it reads as hope, rather than any analysis of the current reality).  Unfortunately, currently NFLX is not covering their cash costs and must continue to access the capital markets.    He even acknowledges that its future bundling opportunities will be limited because it is not a platform company like FB, AAPL or GOOGL (i.e. other providers will be pulling all of their content from NFLX).  I understand the level of euphoria in the stock and the tendency to get caught up in nominations vs award.  Those unfortunately are not examples of where the rubber hits the road.  The company must generate growing, positive cash flow and extremely high returns at that in order to justify and sustain this valuation.  That is simply not happening and that continued failure will eventually will drive the stock downward, overwhelming the hype.  When the analyst uses lines like, ""it could be worth as much as Disney"" with no true fundamental analysis to back up that statement, you know they are getting caught up in the euphoria.",
"Hulu just added 5 mm users and now has 17 mm.  NFLX won one Golden Globe award to Hulu's 2--how things can change in one year! When DIS takes control, Hulu growth will no doubt accelerate.  I am not making a mistake in terms of evaluating how ""powerful"" NFLX is.  I am also keenly aware of the lack of barriers to entry for deep pocketed players like DIS, CMCSA, AAPL, GOOGL, etc.  It is also really simple for consumers to simply cancel their subscription to NFLX as they lose a massive amount of content when DIS/FOX (and other current content providers) leave to create their own OTT offerings for $10/month.  There is no reason whatsoever for DIS/Fox to keep any content on NFLX in the future for the same reason DIS does not air their shows on CBS--The use their own network channels.  Original content is a very risky and expensive business right now (NFLX will spend $12 Bill + on content).  NFLX doesn't have a fraction of the content or assets DIS has, yet has a market cap = to more than 1/2 of DIS.  I see NFLX adding users for another few quarters and then growth will decelerate rapidly in both users and revenue.NFLX has a WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) that is higher than its ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)--they are not earning more than their cost of capital and a negative operating cash flow the last 12 quarters in a row (that is as far as I felt I needed to go back to make my point).  NFLX pretax margins are in the very low single digits and Operating Margins are in the mid single digits.  So to the comment above that is praying for 15% margins, there is simply no evidence whatsoever in the NFLX business model of the past or foreseeable future for them to achieve 15% margins, so your math simply does not work or make reasonable sense.To the person asking why I said $180, that is my near term target on the downside.  As I stated in my earlier comment, I believe any valuation above $60/share for NFLX is extremely generous and longer term (1 year +), I see the stock going back down to those levels as the market starts to come to grips with the reality of the numbers that will be put up by this company.  I am unemotional about the position, I am just doing the  math on the actual numbers being put up by the company instead of being caught up by the fact that NFLX may be able to come up with some good shows for people to watch. I am staying short.",
"Most estimates require 30M-50M users for Disney to break even on their OTT service. And even Disney and Fox combined don't have enough content to compete with Netflix heads-on, that's why Iger is pricing it much lower. I wonder how many content providers are confident they can get 30M+ users if they go direct-to-consumer? Hulu only has 12M users after a decade for crying out loud, backed by 4 big studios nonetheless.",
"10 hits, 5 hits or no hits, that really doesn't change what i am saying.  They are nowhere near the profit levels that would justify a $92Bill market cap.  Yes, I have read most of the bullish reports on the stock and stand by my comment that none of them are based in acceptable/reasonable math using numbers the company is currently generating.  I have seen fantasy predictions of revenue growth and valuation analysis that is forced to go out 5+ years at super high growth rates in both revenues and cash flow in order to come up with targets at or above the current levels of the stock.  Analysts did the same type of creative analysis in 1999 that not only got them in trouble, but were proved to be wildly off the mark.Same case here.  Analysts believe that NFLX revenue will approximately double from 2017 levels by 2020 and earnings will go up more than fourfold over the same three year period.  I am saying that with the stock trading at about 39X that wildly aggressive 2020 number/assumption, it is already factoring in that scenario and secondly, that scenario has an extremely low probability of occurring as many previous content providers NFLX has relied upon to maintain the attractiveness of their product offering will not be renewing their license agreements with NFLX as those providers will be pursuing their own offerings and need to keep their content proprietary on the web in order to sell their own offerings (i.e they will follow the lead of Bob Iger). In summary, losing DIS/Fox content was the death shot to this growth story as NFLX will essentially be relying on their own content by 2020 and no one on Wall Street or Main Street will be willing to pay a 40+ multiple for that difficult and tremendously competitive, expensive, cyclical business and NFLX will not be growing anywhere near the rate it did in the past.  As the growth rate decelerates rapidly over the next few years, so will the P/E compress rapidly.",
"Saying NFLX has hit shows is difficult to defend since they never disclose viewership on a per show basis.  Because of this there's no way to really know which of their shows are truly ""hits"".",
Good thoughts. It would be ridiculous for Apple to buy Netflix at its current valuation.,
"interesting also that the bull thesis has no solid, defendable math behind it as well.",
"just because they have a few good shows right now, does not make it a growth stock worth $92Bill and a 92 P/E ratio.  You should continue praying and playing the greater fool theory. I do not care how many hit shows they come up with in a given year, that is my whole point--they are no different than all of the other networks--they will continue to gain and lose talent to other networks and battle for ratings.  Withing the next 12-24 months, there will be plenty of OTT offering to choose from and if that is your only differentiating factor, then a 92 multiple will simply not hold up when CBS trades at 11X earnings and DIS (with the best content in the world) trades at 17X forward earnings estimates.  I am confident I will make at least $30/share on this short in the intermediate term.  As I stated, as this stock goes through massive multiple compression as the investment community comes around to realize NFLX is just a new network like FOX was many years ago, there will be much more significant downside.  Good luck buying it here at $210+/share.  Lastly, Tim Cook and APPL did not get to where they are by paying 92X earnings for an asset that they can easily recreate themselves much, much cheaper (i.e. earn a positive return on investment) by hiring some talented content people and putting some of their own cash behind it.",
"NFLX  is arguably the most overvalued stock in the whole S&P 500 Index. Holders are praying for a takeover (greater fool theory).  The psychology to this stock reminds me of the same view investors had of AOL in 1999 just before they realized it was just another browser with not so great content.  Once NFLX loses all of the great Disney content over the next year and then the Fox content Disney is purchasing (other content owners will flee NFLX as well and opt for their own OTT offering), there will not be so much content left and investors will soon realize that NFLX is just another network/channel spending enormous sums of money hoping for the next trendy hit show.  I would much rather own Disney or even CBS or CMCSA that have a much more extensive library and much, much cheaper valuations, seemingly all doing the same thing.  Analysts believe NFLX may earn $2.28/share in 2018.  2019 will be a huge question mark for NFLX with all of the content NFLX is losing--Star Wars, Pixar, all of the Marvel movies, the rest of Disney and Fox lineup (X-men, Simpsons, etc, etc. the list goes on).  The street will soon realize how insane it is to pay 92X forward earnings (if NFLX makes the 2018 consensus number) for just another network that will be struggling to catch up on the content side when content creation costs billions, costs are going higher and they are competing against companies with deeper pockets--AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN --or simply a lot more content to begin with -- DIS/FOX, CBS, CMCSA, etc.  If you put a more reasonable (yet still generous for another network media company), 25 multiple on the hope for $2.28 in 2018 consensus earnings figure, you get a $57 stock.  I stress that 25x is generous for this name in this competitive media content field they are in.  That is plenty of downside and I see no realistic math to support the upside.  In full disclosure, I am short the stock.",
"While I kinda like the idea also of Apple buying Tesla as both are considered by some investors as technology companies vs product companies where Apple's technologies can accelerate the use of such technologies in automobiles, Tesla's price multiple, like Netflix's, is way too high for Apple and Elon needs Apple way, way more than Apple needs Tesla, whose technologies can be bought and/or licensed much more efficiently, ie financially for Apple.I suspect that all this wishful thinking about salvaging the cash flow sinkholes by utilizing the richest cash full company is, just that: wishful fantasizing.  Daydream On!",
"Netflix is doing fine. It can tap bond market easily for growth, why does it need an acquisition? NFLX will be a 50B company in 5 - 10 years.",
NFLX is too expensive but Fox is just the first content production company to get out of the business because streaming is becoming a battle of the behemoths. There are a few other big names that seem to be spinning their wheels that AAPL might want to look at. CBS is unlikely to make streaming work for them. Star Trek and the Twilight Zone simply aren't big enough brands. HBO (Time Warner) is dithering around. Why isn't HBO Now global by now? Game of Thrones is a huge brand that could use better management. AMC is almost on par with FX for quality productions. NBC/SyFy and the rest of Comcast's content portfolio could have a great future on streaming if they weren't owned by a cable company that is trying desperately to hang onto a dying business model.,
"Buying Tesla is still a logical Apple move. Tesla has an obvious runway to ~2M volume premium vehicles at high margin with a strong option on TaaS. These markets can move the needle for Apple more than Netflix could even, and Tesla could use the capital and headcount throughput to accelerate their plans. Tim Cook would be a good moderation to Elon's weaker aspects.But Disney was the one that should have bought Netflix ~3-5 years ago. Too late now. More likely that Netflix buys Disney in 10 years than the reverse (neither really likely).",
I see a PayPal aquisition before any kind of content delivery platform. Apple can build content delivery on their own. What they need is wider adoption of their payments platform so the phone can replace the wallet.,
Apple could buy or start a number of original content studios just run them through its own service.  They could partner with Disney on a long term deal which would work for both of them - sports and kids are great motivators for purchasing.  Or they could but a utility or build their own to deliver super fast and reliable delivery of content either through wired or wireless technology.Netflix is not required for any of these moves.  That is not to say they are not valuable.   They are currently spending an incredible amount of money on content delivery - not just getting the rights but dubbing or subtitling all of these movies in a huge amount of languages all over the world.  You can see sponge bob in Swahili if you want.  They will have a true international distribution which is why they are worth a lot.,
NFLX will triple in the next 5 years so it would be disappointing if they got bought out by a stagnant megacorp.,
4. Making large acquisitions isn’t in Apple’s play-book / corporate culture.,
"Apple is dipping its toes into content development.  The modus operandi for Apple is to learn about a business before jumping in.  It can easily afford to spend $5-10 billion a year in content development without blinking, which is as much as Netflix is spending. Netflix is actually stronger than most people think.  First, Netflix has a broader distribution overseas.  It is the only one of the content provider that is now reaching around the world.  You can view Netflix movies and TV in Hong Kong, Japan, and India, as well as Europe and Americas.  Many people who are joining Netflix from overseas.  Second, Netflix has more and better original contents than Amazon, including its own series and foreign movies. Third, Netflix does not need to be acquired by anybody.  They are making a profit and have been growing.  Apple has no reason to acquire Netflix.  Right now, all Apple users can easily use Netflix on their devices, just like they can use Amazon Prime, Hulu, MUBI, and other streaming services to view videos.  Despite all the excitement about YouTube, most people do not use YouTube to watch movies or TV series.  There is no value added that Apple can provide for Netflix.  On the other hand, I think that  Apple needs something to beef up its Apple Music .  Despite its home court advantage, Apple Music is not successfully competing with Spotify.  While Apple Music has grown to about 30 million, Spotify has grown to 70 million paid subscribers.  Apple Music appeals to a limited group of music listeners, mostly young millennials.  For the vast majority of older listeners, including baby boomers, Apple Music makes it difficult to get the music they like, e.g. swing, dance, jazz, rock, country, folk, international music.  The front page of iTunes offers none of these categories. Pandora is now for sale for under a billion.  Pandora has a large and deep database of user preferences that it has accumulated over the past decade. Apple would add tremendous value to Pandora and much needed infrastructure for music streaming.  Pandora is more suitable for an international audience.  The price is right.",

"There are few companies that rise to Apple's level of profitability. Their purchase of Beats was more of a PC purchase by Tim Cook than a revenue enhancing one. Apple is in a unique situation that allows it to buy almost any company. What would be the best way to go forward would be to buy a company that would streamline its ability to produce iPhones or new products more efficiently --- such as a chip manufacturer. However, as a large shareholder I would not be adverse to a company that helped the bottom line, but I a, not sure which company might fit that bill.",
"Robert Riesen Great article. I totally agree with your conclusions. NFLX is way overvalued for such a small margin service. Granted NFLX is growing, and is the leader in the streaming space.I think Apple will make a move into autos. I do not mean actually making cars but I mean ride sharing software and communications as well as infotainment systems.Who that is, I think China's ride sharing Didi will get more investment. No investment in Tesla IMO.",

I mean Apple won't buy Netflix ever. The name of the game is again pump and dump. Everyone is talking about Tesla these days but the first company to suffer in a downturn will be Netflix with a market cap of $90 billion and a PE of 200 something.,
Apple doesn’t need Netflix at all. It can start a Netflix-like business whenever it wishes by making small changes to iTunes. There is 0% chance of this happening anytime.,

It also provides Alder with clarity for its ongoing plans in the field.Under the terms of the agreement, Alder has received a non-exclusive license to Teva's anti-CGRP antibodies patent portfolio to develop, manufacture and commercialize eptinezumab in the U.S. and worldwide, excluding Japan and Korea. In exchange, Alder has agreed to:Withdraw its appeal before the European Patent Office;Make an immediate one-time payment of $25 million to Teva;Make a second one-time payment of $25 million upon the approval of a biologics license application (BLA) for Alder's eptinezumab with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or of an earlier equivalent filing with a regulatory authority elsewhere in the license territory in which any Teva licensed patents exist;Following commercial launch of eptinezumab, pay $75 million at each of two sales-related milestones (at $1 billion and $2 billion in sales achieved in a calendar year) and provide certain royalty payments on net sales at rates from 5% to 7%.""This agreement reinforces the broad coverage provided by Teva's IP in the field of anti-CGRP antibodies therapy. At the same time, it also helps facilitate the ongoing development of additional potential therapies in this exciting field - this can only be good for our increased understanding of the area and ultimately improved patient wellbeing"", said Marcelo Bigal, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Specialty R&D at Teva.",

"Seriously folks, Gain is not a 'Crypto' play. 1. They do not accept bitcoin payments, in fact they have zero blockchain technology in place. 2. This is for day trading speculation with a max cap risk per client. This is a marketing gimmick to lure in new clients, which will have a limited effect as it's already being rolled out by all the competitors (IG/Plus 500/CMC/Spreadex etc)Their regulatory challenges with Mifid II is more of a headwind than the technology-less dabble into 'crypto'. I have to admit, all it takes is an announcement with the word 'cryptocurrency' on it to pump up the stock temporarily, but this isn't in any way shape or form comparable to what OSTK is doing.  This analysis is superfluous 1. Incorrect competitors YoBit, not YouBit... and NiceHash are just not 'Traditional Exchanges' They are the new kids on the block and don't compete with Gain. Just 1 factor (crypto) taken out of proportion and context. If you're going into Gain because of their Crypto, you're going into them for all the wrong reasons as their true competition is doing the exact same so be prepared to be disappointed.",

"Alex Henrik, Contributor:You've mentioned 5 times in this thread in 5 different posts that ""GCAP is overhyped and with cryto not expected to be a meaningful business for the foreseeable future.""  You've developed a narrative in an effort to support your short thesis, and yet you offer nothing to confirm your ""not expected to be a meaningful business for the foreseeable future"" claim.  At least Mr. Dergunov has shared honest facts about the company, while highlighting the reasons for his long position, while citing the risks as well.Overstock (OSTK) is getting a premium at this point, as the CEO has shared that his primary asset is in play, plus he's progressed very well with blockchain technology and partners.  I am a technical trader, and primarily a swing trader.  GCAP went public in 2010, and has built a 7 year base since then.  Only recently, within the past several weeks has the volume dramatically increased and the street is starting to notice.  Sure, it was normal that the initial 2 day move from about $7 to $13 was faded.  The action now (past several sessions) is called backing and filling, something the parabolic broader markets have not done.  This is a normal technical move.  If you're truly a regular ""contributor"" for SA, and you're unable to substantiate your short thesis, then your contribution here at GCAP doesn't have much merit, and I would advise other longs reading this thread to base their investing/trading decisions on technicals and fundamentals, not unsubstantiated opinions.  If you're interested in a ""safer"" crypto short idea, you might try RIOT or LFIN.  There's a fee to borrow the shares, but it's worth it.  As for GCAP, for now support levels are holding up.  The stock needs to consolidate as it's doing, in order to provide a more sustained move up that will eventually flush out the day traders, both short and long.Good trading to you and everyone else reading this thread.",

"Gain capital is a market maker running a natural hedge book - that is they win on client losses => BTC is not FX, commodities or stock indices in that the price moves in a persistent manner, requires 5 times more capital to hedge at Liquidity Providers and if  BTC price rises and Gain is short = Gains loses money- so Gain either remains unhedged hoping for two way flow by traders - except BTC buyers tend to hold and the average holding period can be months - or they hedge and such chew up 5 times more capital and capture a small spreadMost CFD-FX margin brokers who are market makers have lost money on BTC assets - they will only make consistent money on price falls - like in December 2017 or BTC acts more like FX instrument [mean reversion in price tendencies] going forward and traders turnover the coin rather than buy - holdIt is not a 1 way street to riches - in fact unless their risk management is better than the market it is possibly earnings negative - as Gain capital shows no real intellectual property in how they manage FX in only making around $120 per million - similar to their spread",

It's actually pretty genius of GCAP. They are not actually going to ever own a single bitcoin. Just settle it all in currency.,
"Victor - There is nothing to this piece. You do zero work on actually understanding Gain Capital. You haven't explained how they make money or GCAP's competitive advantage.We made money trading GCAP, but it was purely based on riding the hype and nonsense. Can you please write a piece that proves that you understand what GCAP does and how it makes money trading Bitcoin? Does GCAP make money taking principal risk or agency risk?",
Hey this is interesting:Latest news is that the main exchanges can't accept new users.So what happens?  Immediate price drops.  They cut of the FOMO crowd and immediately there are no more buyers and boom.. price drops all around.  Interesting to see what happens next.,

What keeps other brokerage firms from offering similar products? Guess what? Nothing.I am firmly holding the bet here - GCAP's new Bitcoin-related offerings will not have a material financial impact for the company for the foreseeable future.,
"So let's say you put in $20,000. You then lever up and buy 4 coins for let's just say $15,000 each or $60,000. After one year you would lose $49.314 a day in carry fees (at $.08214% overnight) or $18,000 if the price never moves. Even the web site says they strongly advise not to carry overnight positions.Looks like just a day trading platform for Bitcoin.",
I’ll lend you my coins lol,
Hard to find a list on their website what countries are available. Can't trade off of their MT4 platform yet. Minimum trade size is 1 coin. 25% margin requirement. Overnight fees will cost you about $38 a coin per day at current prices.,
"Working in China for the past 4years I can say that BTC trading is actually easier than ever. The ban on BTC and altcoins in 2017 simply moved the company registration of those exchanges offshore (to HK, Singapore and the Caribbean’s). Trading is far more advanced than any exchanges I’ve seen in the West while funding and withdrawing through the local banks (or shadow banking) is more work but it is efficient with no major incidents or scams yet. For Gain Capital to succeed it must appeal to and capture Chinese institutional money which is an unlikely possibility.",

"While I have always liked NYCB's multifamily loan business and I currently hold a significant  amount (for me) of NYCB shares having $ cost averaged down while the stock price was dropping as low as below $12 at one point, the Astoria fiasco still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. You mention the following:""... the self-inflicted wounds that the bank has endured are only temporary....""What worries me is that stupidity is not temporary.",
"NYCB painted itself into a corner while their $1/yr dividend ate up most of their earnings year after year, and while staying below the $50B SIFI threshold served to cap their earnings potential.  Add in the dividend cut (a ""minor adjustment"" per Mr. Cangemi)--which has not been reversed even in part--and you have the formula for a stock which has been ""dead money"" for a decade & which now appears to lack the currency to make an accretive deal, as targets get pricier & NYCB's stock value languishes. NYCB's ""moat"" also serves as a barrier to its being bought out, since its lending niche is not one readily absorbed by a larger player.Maybe, the rising economic tide will raise this boat too, but it's hard to buy into the view that NYCB is an especially attractive opportunity.",
"I'm long NYCB but they don't have a moat or a lock on anything. 5% yield, conservative, and will grow with rising interest rates.",
"Ongoing NIM is of most interest as this is how they make money. Has been trending down and currently the yield curve stays flat.  No excuses on the dividend. They no longer make enough to pay the former rate. Would like to hear more on the potential for growth. Seems like the loan to deposit ratio, and cost of funds  is already high. How can they make more loans from here?",
I'm also long on NYCB. Hoping that any changes on DF might be a big help.,
Nobody knows what they will do have been a holder for sometime and it like a broken record. They waited for the government to make any changes that's the problem and sold off assets to stay under the Sifi limit. They need new management to change things for us the shareholders this one certainly won't change. They keep getting richer with free stock and we get dividend cut and crappy stock performance! I can't stand listening to the earnings call you can go back for years and it's the same as the one before! How about plans to raise the divided back up I would guarantee the stock would follow just like it tanked with the cut and the embarrassment of the failed Astoria deal what a complete waste of money!

Destroying shareholder value is not something management should be good at. The CEO and the BOD lined their own pockets at the shareholders’ expense. Sold my shares.,
"There are a couple of errors in this article--commission: Astoria backed out of the deal with NYCB; the difficulties with getting reg oks  -even after it cut its div per reg request really was not the tripping point: rather it was a potential higher offer from Sterling. As a holder  [my largest] of NYCB, I felt they had over paid in the first place.The tea leaves said that the 50 window was going to open wider and that with the new administration it was likely that the OK would come along soon.Omission: There is a danger that other non-regulated institutions may attempt to enter the market as they did previously, driving downing the profitability of its ""moated"" business. Note that NYCB backed away from a number of deals that were too rich and subsequently went sour. While this may have negatively impacted their short term profits, it certainly paid off as they went belly up during the downturn.To be clear, NYCB is my biggest holding and I have great hopes for the future.No, they will not be taken over, they will take out once they have a currency that allows it",
"The aborted Astoria deal soured me on NYCB's management and board.

If you know enough about GLW, you know where their R&D facility is located and, if you know the right people you can learn much more than discussed in the market or on their financials. Now some insight. I'll refrain from discussing specifics because they AREN'T available to the public, only insiders in internal accounting, and before their consolidated tax return is due. R&D costs are written down in the year incurred, (accrual accounting). The IRS has no way of ever disputing those numbers in a tech company, therefore, unless internal auditors disclose malfeasance, you won't find it or will any paid auditors. So, if you can prove an accounting metric used by GLW, provide it, otherwise it's smoke and mirrors. Additionally, the sales and marketing are in large part from foreign subsidiaries massaged by transfer pricing before arriving at GLW's consolidated tax disclosure. Therefore, unless you're part of the GLW internal audit team, it's all smoke and mirrors on any SEC or consolidated filing for the rank and file to bolster investor confidence, whatever that means.

They are usually listed as a technology holding and that is right where they belong. Another person commented on Corning and Saint Gobain and they're already involved in a JV for the auto market. The note about some using GG without it being known is right on the money as some have that included in the sales clause. Growth in GG continues to grow YOY not bad for a product first invented in 1960 and is now in it's fifth generation of being further refined by Corning to meet newer use demands.  Competition is out there but as of yet no one can do what they do better or cheaper in several things. The JV with Saint Gobain for example utilizes Corning's fusion process yet another ground breaking revolutionary glass making process . And some of those competitors you mention start out with substrate glass supplied by none other then Corning.   The GPF market should grow this year as the newer more stringent pollution laws take hold in other parts of the world where they produce and market them. Meanwhile the lifeline that kept them afloat the display division is no longer the only true revenue producer for them a much better balance is happening.

"I still hold shares of XPL and regularly stay in contact with the company's CEO. Negative sentiment towards base metals and economic growth, combined with tax-loss selling and a lack of news announcements from the company, have made XPL a tough stock for investors to hold. However, with a market capitalization of less than $20 million, no debt, cash on the books of around $13 million, and interests in two significant intermediate-term zinc properties, it seems like capitulation to sell at these prices. The CEO has been a steady buyer of the stock, purchasing another 10,000 shares today to bring his holdings up to 1.595 million shares.

"Dr Tran BioSci The Maturation of Biotechnology  !!! Excellent value proposition from multiple POV's . About 20+ years ago, market caps that were $350M-$750M were the sweet spot. You could identify the corresponding pristine IP , for the large part de-risked, to a large extent, and extrapolate that the majority would go to $2B-$8 B in a few years. Now the corresponding market caps are $1 B-$5B for the same quality and ability for appreciation to $6B-$15B market cap size. The major difference today is far superior, less risky assets with far better science and earlier proof of concept and safety. Advanced Clinical Trial failure is much less common today which allows for the appreciation we are seeing. Today I consider these as SMID cap stocks. The strong mid caps of today are the ALXN, BIIB, INCY, LOXO, TSRO, VRTX, REGN, BGNE, et al which shortly will grow and become $50+B mega Caps, eventually becoming our new Large Cap Biotech growth stocks.

"Nezmo:Couple of suggestions:  As others have noted. read all you can. If you play options, perhaps as a starter, try LEAPS (normally giving you about 1-2 years out to exercise), that way you have quite a length of time for whatever thesis you believe will unfold in the companies you're optioning.They also provide an extra time cushion, for the times you're mistaken in your option play.Naturally, interest expense is figured in the costs of the option; however with rates low, the 3% or so rate is nominal by historical standards.Two more quick thoughts : from my experience the most amount of money I've lost is buying companies (even companies that have had been in business 50 years or more), that accumulated a lot of debt and ultimately cratered in price.TEVA is a recent example.Importantly, understand yourself in the type of investor you are particuarly when dealing in conflict and when the yogurt hits the fan in the market.Are you patient?  Are you a momentum investor, value oreientated, growth companies attract you with their story, but higher valuations, short term, medium term, or long term investor?Experiment a little and see what fits your comfort zone and what doesn't work and what does.Keep an objective mind, even weighing against one's own bias's and watch for self serving interests in the financial world-it and they can be carefully disguised and very convincing.....Danger, Will Robinson, Danger!.....LOLDue to higher valuations, its a more risky market now,  but there are always good companies,that offer good value to invest in for the future.Good luck & wisdom in your decision making.",

"New corporate tax rates may boost the bottom line, even as top line is fairly flat. I believe TLF is paying about 31 to 34% U.S. Fed rate, which would drop to the new tax rate.

"Richard Uihlein named Chairman of the Board by Galectin Therapeutics:As Chairman, I am committed to optimizing the value of our proprietary compound, GR-MD-02, and helping steer the company through its next phase,” said Mr. Uihlein. “NASH cirrhosis is a disease that affects millions of people here in the U.S. as well as around the world, and there is no known cure. The results of the recent NASH-CX trial may represent a breakthrough for patients with NASH cirrhosis, and GR-MD-02 shows great promise as a potential treatment for a wide range of other diseases. At this important inflection point in the Company’s growth, I believe it was the right time to take a more active role where I can use my prior experience building businesses to guide the Company forward with a focus on the long-term success of Galectin Therapeutics.”",

GALT just voted to increase shares authorized from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000. This is obviously done with intent to further dilute in the future to pay for the 2-5 year Phase 3 trial and guarantee Richard E. Uihlein be paid back. Also, considering there were 35,638,698 shares outstanding as of 9/31/2017, there were also 14,361,302 authorized but unissued shares before the vote. Now theres 64,361,302 authorized but unissued shares, which is a 448% increase in potential future dilution. Another interesting point is that Richard E. Uihlein (credit line provider) was just elected to the board of directors, and 1,000,000 additional shares were just added to the executive payment reserve. So I think it's safe to assume that Uihlein will profit regardless of *potential* Phase 3 results.",

With availability somewhat similar to dialysis treatments for CKD patients.Does anyone see this being explored for treatment of alcohol-induced cirrhotics?

Good discussion There is another company Glycomimetics that has a preclinical Galectin 3 inhibitor program for NASHLJPC gave up on their citrus pectin years agoWe are sitting pretty here,
"Pennystock, The only possible competitor in the galactin 3 inhibition space I am aware of is that of a privately held French company and they are still busy doing pre-clinical studies. I am not sure how far along GALT is on their orally active inhibitors - and it has been ongoing for a while. That being the case, I still think the worry about a competing orally active inhibitor is over blown as not every galactin-3 binding carbohydrates have the same property  (thus spoke ala GALT management also). Seems like the starting material of these complex carbohydrate in all cases I examined is citrus pectins. The compound isolated will vary between different companies depending on the isolation procedure. For example, if the isolation consists of a alkaline step, deadening on the PH and the temperature of treatment, the isolation step could destroy the ability of the compound to induce cell death in cancer cells even though the compound may still retain the ability to block galactiin 3, inhibiting metastasis. Thus, until a company produces clear clinical results, I won't worry about them being able to compete with GALT. Regarding patient compliance, you do realize treatment of patients consists of injection twice a month, not twice a day - unlike insulin. This most likely be due to the biological half-life of the carbohydrate, which the clinical outcome seems to suggest of being long.  As a comparison, thyroid hormones have a half-life of almost a week in vivo. I better stop, I am not teaching medical students anymore.",
"Some people are sceptical as to GALT's marketing prospects because GR-MD-02 is an IV-drug which could cause compliance problems with patients, whereas competitors have compounds which are administered orally. Any feelings about this?",

They plan to conduct P3 only for the targeted patients ie CX stage 1 w/o variaces - this will increase the probability of success substantially4. This may not perform like MDGL, but if they complete P3 successfully - it will be the only drug to address CX - this could be significant",

(1) comp to strong Q2 2017 so 1.6% if okay OR (2) comp to Q2 2017 with supply chain challenges so 1.6% is disappointing.I was long TUES from $1.75 to $3.00 (sold for other opportunities but looking to get back in).

Net sales were $334 million with a comparable store sales increase of 1.6%, which was comprised of a 1.7% increase in customer transactions, slightly offset by a 0.1% decrease in average ticket. Steve Becker, Chief Executive Officer said, “We delivered a 1.6% comp for our second fiscal quarter and a 2.4% comp for the six months ending in December.  Throughout the peak season, we experienced significant improvement in our supply chain operations, benefiting from the management, personnel, systems and process changes that we have made. We continued to effectively manage our working capital, reducing our overall inventory balance by approximately $30 million or 12% versus December quarter end last year and we ended the quarter with no outstanding balances under our revolving line of credit. As is typical, we will begin to use our line again during the March quarter as our inventories build.  We are pleased with our inventory composition and are well positioned for a positive spring season with the freshness and quality of inventory, especially relative to the challenges faced last spring in the aftermath of the Phoenix distribution center opening.  We remain comfortable with our previously provided outlook for a 2% to 5% comp sales increase and a significant improvement in Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018, which includes a material increase in gross margins in the spring season reflecting reduced distribution costs.  We are focused on opportunities to improve our sales and profitability, including continued improvement in inventory levels in subsets of our store base.”The Company will report complete financial results for the second quarter on Thursday, February 1, 2018.",

Don’t understand a business model when your stores are only open 1/2 of a day per week 😉,
I still can't understand the high short interest level. They had a chance to unload under two dollars a share. That for a company selling at way under book. I find your liquidation value of $2.20 very plausible. A short squeeze would swing the pendulum way North of your highest priced scenario.,

They are now switching strategy it seems and trying to get investors to buy in to the fact that it's their data and ""network"" that is what will be valuable in the future. They may very well be right that there is some value there but  when you're losing over $100M a year with no end in sight I doubt they will be around long enough to see it.

When we get to the point where everyone is being sequenced for less than $300, which will be in the next 5-10 years, insurance companies will either be sequencing themselves or contracting with a low cost option. They won’t be paying $2,500 a sample. That is not sustainable.",

"I’m not going to comment on these individual stocks, but give a macro view. I am a physician-scientist at a large government facility on the East coast. My special is genetic causes of a certain childhood condition (I’m being vague on purpose) and my research is driven by whole exome sequence findings.We regularly sequence about 30 patients per year. Why not all? Because it costs about $550 for a 100x exome sequence. And this is Research Use Only prices. Clinical exomes cost much more, 1-2k). We don’t find stuff all the time, mostly because we don’t know how to make sense of the data at this time. All genes are known, but we don’t know all their functions. Once we have more sequences, we’ll be able to connect the dots better. We all can envision a time in the future where every patient has their exomes or genome sequenced. Sequencing will become a commodity, like any other blood test. The huge limiting factor will be the bioinformatic analysis and the first company who develops an automated way of exome analysis will make an ungodly amounts of money. Right now, it is via multiple R programs stitched together and you need a PhD in bioinformatics to do it. As for these companies, I don’t know. Exome sequencing is not patented - nor is the analysis. And one companies sequencing is no better than another’s. They are all using the same sequencers and kits. By the time sequencing becomes widespread, costs should be below $100. Until then, sequencing is more of a research question, not a clinical one. Academic researchers don’t send their samples to these places. We do it ourselves. But, if you want a “sell the shovels” sort of investment, buy ILMN. All the sequencing and consumables are done via their sequencers and kits. Wide moat. Another one would be TMO, who bought Affymetrix last year.",
"Another good one would be OPK. They own GeneDx, which is a CLIA certified sequencing company. Clinicians have been sending samples to GeneDx for years. They do great work and do Clinical Exomes. But again, at academic centers, sequencing is usually done in-house. I don’t know what these other companies can offer.",

(OTC PINK: HEMP) executives updated its shareholders today that Indiana House voted unanimously yesterday for a bill that would allow Hoosier farmers to grow industrial hemp. According to the Indiana General Assembly, House Bill 1137, ""authorizes the Indiana state department of agriculture (department) to establish an agricultural pilot program to study the growth, cultivation, and marketing of industrial hemp and industrial hemp products. Provides that the agricultural pilot programs administered by the department and the state seed commissioner are separate programs... provides that a person who complies with the requirements of the state industrial hemp law is not subject to any civil action or criminal proceeding for engaging in an activity allowed under the state industrial hemp law.""According to the news source IndyStar.com, part of the USA Today Network, under Representative Jim Lucas' House Bill 1137, ""acres of the green leafy plants could be intermingled with rows of corn across family farms in Indiana. Currently, only researchers at institutions are allowed to grow the plant and are unable to do so for commercial purposes. Only Purdue University researchers are growing the product in the state. The provision could see some pushback in the Senate, or from individuals like Attorney General Curtis Hill, who has been outspoken against marijuana legalization."" To read the full article, click here.Bruce Perlowin, CEO of Hemp, Inc. (OTC PINK: HEMP), said, ""Indiana's unanimous vote underscores the fact that the visionary mindset of Hemp, Inc. is way ahead of the curve as each state, one after another, relentlessly legalizes industrial hemp, thus giving Hemp, Inc. a huge jump in the industry. As far as processing industrial hemp in the US goes, there's nobody even in second place."" Perlowin continued, ""And just look at the industry backlash from U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to rescind the Cole Memo - a 2013 Department of Justice document - which increased some legal protections for businesses operating in states that allow and regulate cannabis sales. That decision is an incredible opportunity for the hemp industry because hemp is the safe bet and a safe haven for those wanting to invest in the cannabis industry.""Perlowin drove home that ""hemp's legal status has nothing to do with Sessions' announcement."" It's important to note that hemp production ""has been enshrined into law by Congress through the 2014 Farm Bill."" This means ""the Department of Justice can't go after hemp growers or processors abiding by the terms of state hemp rules like they possibly could with marijuana."" It's the ""public's perception"" of hemp that was affected, not hemp's legal status. ""Hemp's inclusion in the 2014 Farm Bill means its legal status can't be usurped by an agency memo."" Hemp entrepreneurs ""believe the industry could even capitalize on Sessions' antagonism to marijuana"" because ""it underscores hemp's legal certainty.""Now that Indiana is starting to open up to industrial hemp, it makes sense for Hemp, Inc. to build one of their Veteran Village Kins Community in that area as well. ""Our 'Veteran Village Kins Communities' is where we will not only grow some of our Hemp, it is a full-blown holistic solution to the multifaceted veteran problems in the USA. Our prototype model is in Arizona about 20 miles north of Kingman and 90 miles from Las Vegas, NV. It's our way of saying, 'Thank You' to our Veterans.""Hemp, Inc. Announces Strategic Hemp Growing Partner ""Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc."" Completes Final Site Plan BlueprintsHemp, Inc. has announced that its strategic growing partner, ""Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc.,"" has completed its final site plan blueprints for its 500-acre site in Golden Valley, Arizona (20 miles north of Kingman, AZ and 90 minutes from Las Vegas, NV). The site plan was submitted to the Mohave County Building Department for final review. The Company is also in the final stages of completing the necessary infrastructure to support an off-grid, renewable, energy system. The remainder of the solar equipment is expected to arrive in the next few days, completing the site's solar power operation.Dwight Jory, the Project Manager for the ""Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc.,"" said, ""We are very happy with the progress. Our Kins Community is really beginning to come together."" In anticipation of planting to begin during the spring, 300 acres have been fenced, 16 overnight trailer park sites are under construction, and six 40x40-ft organic vegetable gardens are ready for seasonal planting, according to Jory. As for the 6 geodesic domes mentioned in an earlier press release, 1 is structurally complete with only the electrical and plumbing to be completed. The rest are on site awaiting final site plan approval. ""We are now accepting volunteers who have expressed an interest in helping to build the first Kins Community for our veterans,"" said Jory. Those interested in making the first hemp growing CBD-producing ""Veteran Village Kins Community"" become a reality should contact Ms. Sandra Williams via email (swilliams@hempinc.com).One thousand trees, on 36 of the 500-acres, have also been planted, with an additional 1,000 trees on order. The ""Veteran Village Kins Community"" site plan also includes a 100,000 square foot GMP compliant, central processing plant, CBD testing laboratory, and various health and wellness centers to support veterans who may have psychological, emotional or health issues.Hemp, Inc. and ""Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc."" began development on the ""Veteran-Village Kins Community in Arizona"" approximately 6 years ago. Kins Communities are designed to grow hemp and produce cannabidiol (CBD) products to benefit veterans and to generate revenue for Hemp, Inc., the Veteran Village, and the individuals living on the land. Each 2.5-acre lot is designed to be self-sustainable, with 1 acre allocated to grow hemp and other areas for an organic garden, natural bee-hives, a living fence, a pond, a family tree and other elements that make up a ""Kins Domain.""To learn more of what a Kins Domain is, click here. Volunteers who want to help build America's first ""Veteran Village Kins Community"" can contact Ms. Sandra Williams via email (swilliams@hempinc.com).""As Hemp, Inc. positions itself on the forefront of America's industrial hemp revolution, we see our partnership with 'Veteran Village Kins Community Arizona, Inc.' being paramount in supporting the small family farm movement that we are confident will reshape the American landscape,"" said Perlowin. ""As we work toward getting our eco-village up and running in Arizona, we are also aggressively scouting strategic locations in other states including North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia. Giving veterans and other Americans a place to learn new skills and take part in this multi-billion-dollar hemp CBD market is very exciting. It's a big part of our mission to give back.""According to Perlowin, seven ""master hemp growers"" from Oregon, Colorado, California, Kentucky, North Carolina, Nevada and, of course, Arizona have expressed an interest in pursuing a joint venture with Hemp, Inc. to each grow industrial hemp on the 300 fenced acres in Arizona. Perlowin says he'll call this ""The Great United American Hemp Project.""To learn more about Veteran-Village Kins Communities to grow hemp, click here.About Hemp, Inc.With a deep-rooted social and environmental mission at its core, Hemp, Inc. seeks to build a business constituency for the American small farmer, the American veteran, and other groups experiencing the ever-increasing disparity between tapering income and soaring expenses.

"What industry trades at 1X sales? Maybe you are confused about the global operations of these companies, as many aren't focused solely on Canada.",
Buying in to Horizons marijuana ETF is the same as committing suicide.  24 months from now you will be broke and so will they.  No cross border shopping in Marijuana guys.  Cant even grow it on California and sell it in Oregon.  Canadian market only $6 billion and the top 4 companies have a market cap of $16 billion...  DUH!  How does that work..  WORTH MORE THAN THE MARKET.  The crash is coming.  Get out while you can.,
"Look for cannabis stocks that have a real business, are still low, show positive news releases with a viable strategy and increasing success, have an excellent product or service (USP = unique selling proposition), and have the potential to multiply in value many times over. Once they do multiply and it starts to look too good, sell. Use candlestick trading for your charts, preferably Heikin Ashi, once the daily candlesticks start to turn red, sell. In ohter word: once the stock starts to make lower highs and hits lower lows, sell. Don't buy when the stock gets expensive or peaks, wait for a better time, let it level out again, look for support levels, then buy. Sell when they peak, they always retreat after that, you can either get back in again once they hit firm support, or you can just enjoy the profit you made.Very rarely these stocks go down more than their 'logical' support levels. Look back for several months to the lows they hit.  For the long run: put a good chunk of your money in one of the ETF's and a few leaders in the sector. Play with smaller money, if you buy low there is very little chance that the stock will go lower after an initial surge. Good Luck.",
Has anyone else considered the fact that Soros had been lobbying (since the 80’s) for decriminalizing and medicinal use with the hopes of getting legislation changed to put his stake in Bayer now Monsanto in prime position for reaping the benefits.

missing Marapharm Ventures,
"it's bad TIMING for getting in NOW as they are already significantly over-valued, the high is past. so these stocks won't be growing like this in the near future when more such companies come out with much lower price. most of these companies have low or negative net income, so it'd take years for them to have such income to equal with their stock value. so eventually they would come down to adjust to their real value. please don't recommend stocks that have already 2 or 3 or 4 times up in short time, as it's time to come down.",

"HOW WE GET TO $1 (copied from another discussion)We start with the fact that mydx has 1,807,904,215 shares outstanding. That's not awful. I wish it were lower. But we can live with it. Now, let's assume the most optimistic scenario about the medical device designation. That since Canadian healthcare insurers have been clamoring for new ways to deliver marijuana aside from smoking buds, and the government has been funding data-driven projects, they not only approve the ECO pen, but recommend it for all 201,398 medical marijuana patients in Canada. That works out to revenue for one product, in one country, for one use of just over $18m. Then, let's assume that investors decide the company has a long way to run. That this revenue, and Canada is only the beginning and allows a P/E of 100, which is high but not insane for early stage companies with huge potential.Where does that one product, in one country leave the stock price?$18,125,820 (sales) / 1.807B shares outstanding = 1.0025 revenue/share X 100 P/E ratio = $1.00/shareThat's not including the growing database, the data licensing, the larger sensor devices, or other countries. That's one product in one country, under (not inconceivable) best case scenario.And suddenly cancelling the reverse split and the comments from the company start to make a whole lot more sense.OK, so $1 is feasible but not likely, not this year. But 5 - 10 cents, now that range certainly looks achievable.",

"boygenius7 - Stick to the Canadian companies, AB is correct that AC is doing a disservice by not pointing out the difference between US Attorneys and State Attorneys. US Attorneys do not answer to the state they are assigned too or the State Attorneys , they answer to Jeff Sessions. If he even opened one investigation into a dispensary anywhere in the USA just imagine the effect it would have on all the American companies and your money. Take some profits to cover your initial investment and stockpile dry powder. Sessions will not be there forever.",

"You, Alan Brochstein, CPF, have it right.There are 93 US attorneys and districts in the US and its territories. They have hundreds of attorneys working for them. U.S. attorneys are appointed by the president, subject to Senate approval. They can be fired by the president. In case of a vacancy, the attorney general can appoint an interim attorney. According to the USA Patriot Act, an interim attorney mar serve indefinitely if the president does not make a new appointment. By this formula, all U.S. attorneys can replaced by Sessions appointees without Senate confirmation.As for what motivates Sessions? that's easy: money, power, hatred.I expect the U.S. to pressure Canada as well. Perhaps build a wall to keep drugs out! Perhaps a nuclear deterrent will persuade the BC freaks. Or a direct assault to liberate them from Chinese invaders. 5440 or Fight!As for Florida: In 2014 the people were ahead going into the election with a majority vote to legalize mj and mmj. But the country's largest cpresidential campaign donor in 2012 and 2016, Sheldon Adelson, 84 now and casino mogul in Las Vegas, came to the rescue with $2.5M for TV advertising against the referendum. His son Mitchell was sucked into addiction by the gateway drug marihuana and died of a heroin overdose. We owe this visionary our children's lives.Despite all this I intend:1. holding all my Canadian mj, by far the bulk of my mj holdings. I expect a dip. I am highly profitable in part because of Ted Ohashi's articles here, and I hope I have the nerve to HOLD.2. I am buying selected U.S. companies in a small way. TRTC ( the inside selling here is acceptable - yes many shares, but the sellers are holding 90%, and my order is already placed.) DIGP and EVIO, and I'm replacing LSHIF (Florida med dispensaries) and maybe PVOTF , both of which I panic sold last week because of the pig Sessions.3. I'll keep an eye on Australian stocks, probably buy even though they jumped:  ACNNF ZLDAFIf mj remains illegal in the U.S. then there's going to be so many other ugly problems to ruin our lives that a big chunk of my portfolio will probably make little difference. FTWI made good money on BTC last year, but I would made far more had I'd just had the guts and maintained the bigger picture and HELD. I won't make that mistake- I hope - with mj, but it's hard to watch giant losses every day. SO - when they start to crash, I'll just go to the zoo, the botanical garden, pick up a nice girl, buy her somethin' until things cool out, and try to stay cool myself.",

"I liked your article very much and I agree that the weed will sell well when it is finally recognized in Canada. But are you are  aware of the following1)Canadian companies that deal with the US can not be listed on the TSX,until the USFeds legitimize it2)in Ontario for sure and possibly the other provinces as well,there will be a Provincial tax on the sale of weed and a special Federal tax as well. In addition the only retail stores that will be licensed to sell the product will be owned and controlled by the Provincial Government,and the price of the product will be determined by them. It makes sense to assume that they will want the price to be lower than Black Market prices(which should hurt the growing companies bottom line) ,but with all the taxes on it I am not so sure they will succeed. In any event I am always wary of being dependent on Government expertise to make a profit.Wonder what your thoughts are on this?",
Market has already shrugged off / ignored Sessions comments,
"It seems to me there are 3 kinds of mj business... medical, commercial and recreational... I rarely if ever see this subject broken down like this... i think the problem is that people just think of mj as recreational and that's where it becomes bound up in moral arguments. Mean while the medical and commercial benefits of the plant are ignored. (It almost seems like its a diversion tactic) I think the likelihood of legislation opening up the medical and commercial production could come quickly and expand rapidly... Wisconsin having already proclaimed that they want to be the hemp capitol of the US and the new surgeon general said medical needs to be legalized. So, my question is: How do I find companies that just grow for industrial hemp (the fiber and oil)? Ill leave the dispensaries and pot heads to work out the recreational use over the next decade...",

Seems to make a lot more sense than industrial warehouses and costly artificial lighting[$electricity$ & $H20$]. My .03 cents worth adjusted for inflation.",
"Trump and Sessions may to outsource to Mexican drug cartels the 250,000 jobs of Americans producing and distributing cannabis in those states where the voters have legalized it, Many of the jobs are filled by recent veterans who make excellent security personnel, in the legal cannabis industry that must use cash, since banks are not allowed to deal with them. On St. Valentines day in 1927 members of the Capone beer cartel killed 7 members of the Malone beer cartel. One of the arguments for repealing prohibition was that such violence would be curtailed if alcohol was legal. However, didn't I see that just last week 7 members of the Coors beer cartel were killed by the Budweiser cartel?",

"Great overview and agree with your analysis. I've diversified with several domestic as well as Canadian. So far doing VERY WELL. I agree that the A.G. statement was a misinterpreted hiccup and a buying opportunity. If you really want to read into it he is basically giving the states the go ahead to ""eliminate  the illegal competition "" by prosecuting at their discretion those in the illegal market; At the same time protecting those legally registered ""TAX PAYING"" entities. So I interpreted the downtrodden reaction as a buying opportunity. Keep in mind this is going to be a MULTIBILLION INDUSTRY with a GREAT TAX REVENUE for the Government. One thing non partisan about government and politicians; THEY DON'T TEND TO BITE THE HAND THAT FEEDS THEM.",
"Rather than helping friends short Cannabis stocks, my first guess was Sessions is in the pocket of Big Pharma.  They have managed to vilify Cannabis and prevent legal access since the 30's.  Why?  Because it is considered a miracle drug by many, with no serious side effects, unlike many if not most prescription drugs.  Pain, nausea, appetite, anti-inflamatory,PTSD, MS, Alzheimers etc.etc., medical Cannabis is eventually going to hurt the revenues and profits of Big Pharma.  They will continue to fight it any way they can - and in the end they will buy up major Cannabis companies to shore up decreasing profits.  It is always all about the money.",
Thanks Anthony for a good article on pot stocks. I own tobacco and am hoping for widerdecriminalization of MJ so tobacco can get into it sooner rather than later.,
"I for one am pleased, so far, with my stake in Canopy; I plan to hold on for the long run.  I feel it's the best bet in the sector.  Jefferson Beauregard Sessions (named after two top-tier Confederate traitors) is a sniveling inbred Alabama rodent, dressed up as a ""man"". He has lots of issues stemming from being constantly harassed on the playground, for his resemblance to a wharf rat. Now nearing his ninth decade of life, as AG he finally has his chance at revenge, and exercises it by his persecutive prosecution of low-level marijuana users, while allowing no time or bother for white supremacist terrorists, as seen in Charlottesville, and in the Missouri Amtrak near-incident last week.  Remember, Sessions is the guy who said he had no issues with the Ku Klux Klan...until he found out many members smoke pot.",
"It should come as no surprise the recent announcement from Jeff Sessions.  It has always been his position even as a Senator and more recently, mentioned in his confirmation hearings.  http://for.tn/2qzi0b2The obvious solution is for Congress to change the law that it wrote; or to let stand what exists and is clear to a Law & Order Administration as Federal Law supercedes State Law.  I wouldn't bet that the current Congress has the spine to do anything but stall until AFTER the 2018 Midterm Election while they hope to be reelected for the ""wonderful"" job they've done in 2017 and the prospects for 2018, e.g., DACA.

"I am still trying to decide if the best plays are growers, distributers, packagers or the shops that will sell to walk in customers.  I also wonder what the laws are/will be for the growers.  Will they be treated like farmers (AG growers) and have the tax benefits/write offs or have they classified them?  Any thoughts on the most likely best plays to consider between packagers (like SGMD) or growers (like AGTK) ?  I remember the history lesson where they said during the gold rush the people that made the real money were the ones selling shovels.  If that was the case here (with MJ) which stocks might those be?

"""They are respecting state rights, which is a theme Trump touted during the presidential election. Therefore, I view the most recent statement as FAVORABLE for the marijuana or cannabis sector.""Anthony, you seem confused. The memo isn't about letting states decide. It's about letting attorneys employed by the U.S. Department of Justice make decisions about enforcement. Your instablog has the wrong folks listed. Here is a link to the correct people: http://bit.ly/2qB89BFThe press release issued by the DOJ is very clear:""In the memorandum, Attorney General Jeff Sessions directs all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities.""""U.S. Attorneys"" not ""State AGs""Further, in case it's not clear:""It is the mission of the Department of Justice to enforce the laws of the United States, and the previous issuance of guidance undermines the rule of law and the ability of our local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement partners to carry out this mission,"" said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. ""Therefore, today's memo on federal marijuana enforcement simply directs all U.S. Attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country.""Here is a link to the memo, in case you didn't see it: http://bit.ly/2Fao90rTrump has just appointed a bunch of these folks (with the help of Jeff Sessions).

no shortage of idiots in DC,
Agree,
I was thinking about purchasing TRTC... until I saw the insider trades for the last couple years... looks like officers are selling as fast as money going in... I got to $6 mil and stopped counting... do you have a take on it?,
What about CBIS?They  the gov clearance  medical marijuana research  and the  merger of their sister company play on blockchain coming up.,
The impact of Sessions does make a significant difference because mj is sched 1 and producers/sellers have basically no access to banking services. So whether the feds ignore or are passive on mj a significant barrier remains.,

"I have been following this sector for last 12 months and reside in CA where recreational Cannabis became legal on Jan. 1, 2018. The state laws conflict with federal law so this will be a roller coaster ride until the two laws are reconciled. There are two ETF’s, HMLSF and MJX to consider, both have similar holdings of Canadian companies.Like all investments, there will be only a few winners in the space so choose carefully and avoid the noise of “get rich quick” promotions as this is a long-term play. California is interesting as the the largest US state with more population than the entire country of Canada. My choices, MJX and a small position in Canopy Growth which is 10% owned by Constellation Brands. Be wise and cautious as most of these companies will fail.",
This is really informative and includes the information I have been searching for.  It gives great insight to the options and possibilities.  Thanks for taking the time to do this.  I am even more convinced of this opportunity (investing in cannabis stocks) is now the right time.  And I agree that Canada may be the best place to invest with the US controversy up/down/up/down history.,
"Again, great article about the sector and prospects for the year looking forward.  It’s unfortunate that I’m not able to get into HMLSF as I see it as a more pure cannabis ETF, as opposed to MJX.  I’m still long in MJX but its holdings could be better.  That being said, I have supplemented my cannabis portfolio with smaller companies that I seem to think have potential and have crossed into the Canadian and American markets. One of which is MCIG.

XYLEM is better positioned and managed for water infrastructure.,
We could be in the early stage of cycle if we get an Infrastructure Bill approved.  Share price has lagged for a year after strong 2016; could move higher as sentiment improves toward the space.  Catalyst include higher municipal spend even without an Infrastructure Bill (as cited by author) and improving housing market but any serious consideration of a bill could really ramp demand for the shares.,
Mid to late cycle descriptor seems not to have strong plausibility.,
"Given the fundamental state of disrepair that water infrastructure is in here within the United States, as well as new housing builds still remaining below long-term averages, it is hard to see how you view this as mid to late cycle.

Hey Shock: They've been selling off big brands and as you say it 'right sizing' a while. They still have an impressive folio but you are probably right in the short - question is you think they right size and stay AGN or M&A end game ? JB,
Pharma companies typically do not lay off workers when they are in a position of strength. The recent layoffs are just another sign of the troubles and weakness at Allergan. At this point the stock likely has a lot of bad news already priced in and so downside risk is low. I would be long here rather than short (and I am) but AGN has a lot of wood to chop...,

It is mainly a spec play for me right now versus a conviction long-term core position hold; we shall see if my sentiments change as the year plays out.",
"Author, In my experience in sales and sales management at GSK, when one of our products went generic, we would promptly lose about a third of the business to the new competition in the first year. The compensation for the sales force changed from one of being paid for increasing market share, to being paid on how little market share was lost in each territory. Superior sales forces (and companies) would not lose 50% in the first year.I experienced losing Zantac, at the time, the world's number one drug, and regular release Wellbutrin. We always planned on 1/3 market share lost in one year. It takes awhile for PBM's, HMO's, pharmacies, and customers to switch. In the second year, you are correct, we then lost about 50% of our sales.I believe your article would have more strength if you gave some credence to the pipeline. Some products from the pipeline are going to be approved, from the outside its hard to predict, but your thesis would have more fair balance if you added some sales from new products.",

I believe they will hire more once they get approvals on Pipeline. I believe their is couple drugs that hopefully will be approved this year correct? I’ve read in several places that their pipeline is robust. I actually think this is perfect time to buy low and hold.,
"Although technically correct this article is about two years too late.  What it conveniently left out are the fact that the stock has just completed a 50% retracment from its old highs, a recent price hike of 10% on its drugs, its low PE multiples in relation to its peers, and that we are now in a period of PE expansion.  Also throw in the unpredictable possible M&A activities in this sector, I believe AGN will be closer to $200 rather than $150.  By the way, a wallstreet ""analyst"" also downgraded AGN to a sell a couple weeks ago.  A sure sign that the bottom has been reached!",
"Nope. - Great companies, like AGN; look for opportunities to tweak, and right size the business at the beginning, or during the fiscal year.- It amounts to something like, opportunistic pruning the labor force that arises from increasing efficiencies within the organization.*For example: TEVA's new-CEO Kare Schultz had to perform a massive global re-organization, as the first order of business, for his first action item on the job, because the previous leadership was hamstrung -- for years -- in pruning, and right-sizing the business. and it got to a ""crisis point"", where; inefficiencies spiraled out of control to the tune of a $3+ Billion drag on the balamce sheet.*Mgmt of organization-101, SE; mgmt need to get with it in a ""real timely"" manner, or; it could spiral out of control to become a ""drag on profits"", if not addressed in a timely, and efficient manner.- Comprende, pal?",

"As this was written before the briefing documents came out on LPCN, what's your current opinion?I think the drug is approvable but I also think that there are a lot of items to get through in very little time. There's no margin for error.The worst issue (imo) is the failure to meet secondary endpoints of Cmax, but in the 001 study, it is described this as transient by Lipocine. In the 002 study, Lipocine had no commentary. I think the secondary efficacy endpoints may be overlooked in favor of a decent primary endpoint in the proposed dosing of 225mg 2x daily with ~84% of patients in the normal range. And, importantly, the vast majority of these patients who were but in normal range were under the normal range, not over it. This supports the safety profile.",

lee any take as why last earning miss by  bbx dropped it anout 15% ..its still reeling  and yet it owns 90% of bxg  a cash cow but having issues itself.In your opinion is it a buy at this point.imho they surpassed expectations for 3 years and finally hit a wall even with the street and funds support.PLEASE enlighten the board on your analysis of last quarter miss ..Cheers ibfsl,
any takes on why this stock is dropping after earnings apparently the success of blue green as not has not carried over to the stock price of bbx it's Canadian investment lost money this year that could affect the bottom line any takes appreciated,
lee what's your take on earnings..appears sweets doing better and some stock  selling before they announced.  after tender stock got to 10...my take is their on the right path and toxic legacy is gold,
Lee thanks for your enlightenment so basically if you don't want to raise cash and think the market will be backing this company and the other businesses gain profitability there is 34% upside from the tender offer possibly if everything goes right thank you Kingfield the Gettysburg Address was allegedly written on the back of an envelope also so you are brilliant I'm going to have to get in the study group to figure this one out but I agree they have made All the Right Moves to entice the street to get behind this puppy and I cannot understand why it is not trading higher any previous posters who have a take on this analysis and their own thoughts give it a go and again Lee thank you for attending class,
Shares are being bought back so options can be issued to the family... like in the past!,
Wow.. now a tender offer 9:25 so let me figure this out bxg is trading at about $20 bbx owns 90% of bxg and BB X's other Investments are not all that terrible and May in some cases be profitable so what does one gain for $0.07 an minor Improvement in the share price yesterday if anyone can crunch the numbers on this deal and tell me why this is logical for shareholders to Tender please enlighten the room with your brilliance if the potential share price target for bbx this year is $11.25 this $0.07 does not sound like much of a premium to me any takes appreciated cheers,
Lee if you're out there what do you think about the earnings of both companies I still cannot understand why bbx is not trading closer to bxg it must be because the other companies are still in development are there expenses and salaries out of line the dividend should help,
0k guys ready for earnings...should mirror bxg..nice tax breaks and making revs....roll em ..,
yep he had to pony up maybe a lesson learned pay shareholders and forget about wholesale purchases that only benefit a few,
Steal is certainly correct!  He stole - or at least tried to steal - that LP years ago.  The courts made him - meaning the existing BFCF shareholders pay more. And how about the old BXG?  Again the courts forced him (existing shareholders) pay an add'l 25%.I still like his undervalued family companies in spite of him...,

User great post and info on fidelity like bfcf bxg flows into  bbx like a holding co plus bbx has other rev streams...gota love the l man agree fidelity just wants the spin off why....maybe,

"Fidelity just took a big stake in BXG.  As you know BBX owns 90% of the BXG shares outstanding.  Fidelity now owns 6% of BXG.  That only leaves 4%, or ~ 2.9 million shares, left in play.

"I'm not sure I agree with zeroing out BBX RE & other businesses and then just halving G&A to come up with a valuation. These businesses aren't going away.

In addition I don't expect management's exorbitant compensation packages to shrink by half even if everything but BXG disappeared tomorrow.It can't be ignored that BBX fancies themselves to be a mini-Berkshire Hathaway and continue to seek to acquire more businesses. Their ability to make these businesses profitable remains in question. I know they originally expected Sweets to be profitable, something which hasn't happened yet. Who knows how Mod Pizza will turn out. Renin has been barely profitable after a nice housing market the last few years.I'm not sure how 'aggressively' they will be in trying to close the BXG-BBX gap. They have had share buyback authorizations in the past and barely used them.I agree it's possible to get a few more bucks out of BBX, but BXG will never trade inline with peers with the ownership structure in place.",

"User growth drives almost everything. Look at how many companies right now are negative profit yet reaching new highs. You have companies with plateauing user growth and still negative worth billions, yet this company is ""too high"" at 200 million when it has gone from basically a nobody to featured many places. No mention of the IPO, which a 70% ownership of Moviepass would basically inflates popular company's market cap (Snapchat was 33 billion day one). I'm sure investors will sit pretty by the time it hits. Netflix and this have subscribers that pay 10$/month, Netflix has 109 million users and 91 billion market cap. Movie Pass has 1.5 million users from 20k last August. If you do the dumb math that puts Movie Pass at 1.3% of Netflix current market cap, which would make Movie Pass value at 1.26 Billion.I understand that it is different profitability margins, initially Netflix had negative profits, was not expected to last or grow to where it became. Large funding will come in with enough users and make it work one way or the other.- Gym membership use/ Gifts/ People excited to use but simply don't. Leave plenty of wiggle room for profits there. If people watch 70% the cost of movie tickets they paid for 90$/year, which is much more than the average movie goer spends a year.- Personal observation: I have purchased Movie Passes for friends and family around me movie pass as gifts and none have turned into a deranged movie nut watching so much it makes me worry about my investment.- Data sells. More people would bring a larger return for Movie Pass. There is no set value you on this, but whoever wants it gets to find out ""what movies people want to watch if there isn't the pressure of spending more than the price of a dvd on a movie."" Hell Netflix could see what people who like subscriptions are interested in theaters before they decide what to pick up.- If it helps the Movie Theaters profit, they will make arrangements to keep this going. Negotiate what works for the chain and movie pass.- Also it's a vested interest to any movie studio that isn't making Superhero movies/Star Wars/Sequels/Reboots. Movies could take more risks with more exposure, a successful moviepass could make unknown films make 100s of millions of dollars from people that weren't being paid because people were unwilling to test. Are people really willing to gamble money in a debt filled bull market that is flooding with pump and dumps that this 200 million dollar company will go to zero? Shorting a company prior to IPO? Shorting while the company just got on mainstream radar? To me that is a much bigger gamble. You could lose 20x your money your money to win 100% as a short, as a long you risk 100% to gain 20x over the next 5 years.",

What was the point of this article? Lol there is literally nothing new but over confident assumptions by the author.,
"One more overlooked MoviePass possible asset not mentioned yet:MoviePass has a patent that may end up being their most valuable future asset......“When a subscriber registers for MoviePass they are mailed a personalized, branded MoviePass card (insert any company card here) that works in conjunction with the MoviePass app (or any other company’s app, if licensed), currently available on Android and iPhone. The service uses a patented geo-location technology that confirms the subscribers presence at the movie theater (could be any place of business), unlocking the card to be used for purchase of a ticket (or any company’s goods) at that specific venue.”Quote from: http://bit.ly/2qzyvnuThis patent could potentially be applied to safely tether all credit cards to owners phones and render them useless if they’re not within the geolocation circle of the tethered phone.....this would be valuable fraud protection for all credit card companies to license. It could potentially be used to stop the sharing of membership cards without also supplying the “fake member” with the owners paired phone..... It could be used to close/pay tabs at restaurants or bars, when the customer leaves the geolocation circle....And on and on and on....",
"A few thoughts:1) The author is absolutely correct about the irrationality of financial markets.2) The author fails to mention the value of data mining. 3) The author fails to acknowledge that capital raises are a certainty, as they are with most other start-ups, but that money can be used to grow the company so the dilution is somewhat moot.I wonder what this author's analysis of Redbox would have been when it announced its $1/day DVD rental policy?The movie industry right now is struggling. Ten years ago, only a handful of movie executives feared YouTube as legitimate competition. It was more of a site where random people put random stuff online, and the overall consensus was, ""Who is going to waste their time watching an unboxing video?"" Well, we know the answer to that now. The movie rental industry similarly poo-pooed Netflix. Who is going to want to wait 2-3 days for a movie to arrive in the mail? Answer: 56M people, because they didn't get the ""Net"" part of Netflix and that DVDs were merely a placeholder until streaming technology became fast enough to create digital on-demand libraries. And movie studios didn't see Netflix as competition because it failed to recognize that Netflix would, one day, become a mini-studio itself. For every movie like StarWars that's a guaranteed box office draw, dozens of movies go unseen. Studios are afraid to commit to making anything original because the financials don't add up. And people then complain there's nothing ""out there"" worth watching, so they stay home and watch something online. MoviePass may or may not succeed, but I'm betting on Mitch Lowe's track record. Right now, it's the best possible chance for saving the movie industry and in time I suspect theater operators will be in a take-it-or-leave it scenario: either share revenue, or MoviePass folds and so too will the theaters as people who were accustomed to $10 all you can watch will not be willing to go back to the old $10 per ticket price model.",
AMC & others will soon realize that the economic value chain for the films to theatres is changing. And it starts by getting as much people to go to the theatres for entertainment. More theatre patrons will make the whole industry bigger. More movies will be made to suit every tastes & preferences. More money spent at the concessions etc. The whole pie gets bigger when there are more customers in it.,

Funny how that works.(Granted, all these analyses are the results of independent writers, not the position of Seeking Alpha itself.

"This article regurgitates tired MoviePass arguments that have already been squashed. The author assumes that 3 million MoviePass subscribers are going to see an average of 2 or even 3 movies a month but that assumption is based on absolutely nothing. Unsupported arguments are no substitute for objective evidence. MoviePass has been in business since 2011 and has tested subscriptions priced from $10 up to $50 and knows BETTER THAN ANYBODY how many movies the average moviegoer attends based on the pricing structure of their plans. If the average subscriber was costing MoviePass double the subscription fee then how has the company been in business for 7 years? Why did the company roll out a $10 plan? The only answers are ridiculous conspiracy theories. Common sense dictates that with a large enough subscriber base (e.g. 3 million) the heavy moviegoer users are balanced out by the low moviegoer users. All that is left is the normal moviegoer that has limited time to see movies because he/she has a family and a job and doesn't have the time to see more than about one movie a month. That's why the CEO of MoviePass recently said that ""the average is much, much lower than you would expect.” http://bit.ly/2qAhiKG",
I don't mind negative articles or articles that go against my position but this article is far from balanced. You failed to mention the vast number of potential and planned revenue streams that will come with the leverage.  You only mentioned the rev stream generated by the subscriptions themselves.  Statistics show that will eventually be a breakeven on the subs when the newness wears off and people start going to fewer movies.This article kind of reminds of an article I read about Netflix and Amazon when the first started. Fast forward 10-12 yrs later...we know how those two co's turned out.,
"If relying strictly on subscriptions for funding, then yes, its possible the cash burn could kill the company eventually. However, if leverage and data becomes marketable as a significant source of revenue, then they will balance out the cash burn.Not everyone watches ten movies a month.

And I plan on keeping my cards.

I just assumed HMNY is relying on a huge portion of the subscriber base to not go to the movie as often. I mean I pay for Netflix and sometimes go months without watching. Same could apply here with this model.,

"The African retail giant says it will report lower first-half earnings after making provisions to deal with Steinhoff's collapsing share priceSteinhoff Africa Retail (STAR) says it will post a sharp drop in first-half earnings after making provisions against its exposure to parent company Steinhoff. In a trading statement on Friday, STAR said earnings per share (EPS) for the six months to end-March would be between 44.2% and 52.2% lower than last year, while headline EPS would decline by between 45.1% and 53.1%.The retail group, which is 71% owned by Steinhoff, said it was party to a guarantee of third party debt related to a historic Pepkor management investment scheme which is underpinned by the Steinhoff share price. Following the collapse of Steinhoff's share price, it said the risk of liability could no longer be considered remote. On top of that, a cash retention scheme was put in place for key senior management. Given the decline of the Steinhoff share price, it said the Steinhoff Scheme no longer addressed the need to retain, motivate and reward employees. It said it had taken a conservative approach to fully provide for STAR's exposure in these matters. Steinhoff's shares have plummeted about 97% since early December when Markus Jooste quit as CEO and it admitted to massive financial irregularities in its accounts.Ignoring the effects of the provisions, STAR said comparable EPS would be between 10.3% and 18.3% higher than last year, while HEPS would rise by between 8.2% and 16.2%.Last week, STAR said it had repaid shareholder loans of R16 billion to Steinhoff after raising R18 billion in new funding. This allowed Steinhoff to clear African debt of €2 billion.STAR's shares closed 1.7% higher at R17.90 on Friday.

"Definitely AsianTiger2. Looks like that to me. They will push for no conversion (still possible). Partial would be fine by me. I am comfortable with my position. IMHO, things are so negative now, that an inkling of positive news will also be overblown (good for us shareholders who know what a reasonable value is, which allows us to get out soon when our target is achieved.).I must say, I have also changed my outlook on the SARB/STAR issue, consistent with the quote above in this article From SAREL. The SARB will have to buckle and let the funds go to fix the Euro mess. What also cannot be underestimated. The board are under intense pressure, but also focused, so each day the team learns more about the business and the restructuring officer also wasn't involved with Steinhoff before, so his experience becomes enhanced each day. He would clearly have gotten a message from the Board to do his job, but to aim for restructuring plans without compromising shareholders.",
"Also, the banks will first wait before converting their debt into equity as they need to ensure there is some equity value left. This is both a blessing and a curse for shareholders. Because they may decide once there is a turnaround in progress to just convert their debt. Doubt that will go down well. There has to be an element of reputational risk as well if they act like that and they will lose respect. The problem now is a strange one. The company hasn't been able to report ANYTHING positive to shareholders. My take is that the company is at its most delicate in terms of listed status until end of June. If it can even survive until June, then that is step 1. If results are okay (they will be and we all know that) then that is step 2. Banks will then have something concrete to fall back on (albeit unaudited) and recovery could well be under way.I see positive news coming in buckets IF it does come. There is a good story to tell for thi group which will lead to a stampeding share price. But, can it work through this mess? 50/50.",

"""The market will stay irrational, for longer than you can stay solvent"". After reading the announcement, that is what I feel like.

"I have found the Steinhoff debacle a very interesting study case, and continue to try and learn as much as possible. Anyone that can provide insight into why the Share price continues to fall? What indicators have there been that delisting is even an option at the moment? Surely no specific bad new is expected at the AGM, and also no AFS expected before June. All bad news must be priced in by now, and I believe news is as good as expected. What drives the price of a stock, and WHY does this fall so sharply at the moment?",
"I believe the Group would have cratered back in January/Feburary, when uncertainty was at its highest. Vague Sens announcements were issued which seemed ""forced"" by the Board just to put an end to the deathly silence before that. The goal of the wider public is to see Steinhoff fail as it represents the whole ""white monopoly capital"" notion. In Germany, no one cares who Wiese and Jooste are, as they have no track record as respected businessman.The risk for fund managers is just too big at this point, although I can only think that are desperate to buy SNH. Fact is, how can you defend yourself buying a company without financials.I recently spoke to a contact at Alan Gray that they are planning to buy at ZAR140.This might have been a comment in passing, but does suggest that institutional investors are simply waiting for the green light (AKA audited financials).Having worked at a big 4 Company, I can tell you that the lifeblood of these companies are recurring audit fees almost at all costs. PWC are well aware that even though they are not responsie for this mess, it will be considered a failure if they don't release the report in a timeframe that allows the company to survive. That's my take. Looking forward to the bext few weeks as it will lead to some concrete information. For our sake, I hope it's positive.",

"Hi Sarel,Thank you for your unbiased opinion and interpretation of events. The media biases and bad reporting has been extremely frustrating. At the moment even good news has little effect on the price. Recent SENS was terrific! Confirmation of continued strategic investment in STAR, only 6% sold so free-float is obtained for Star, confirmation of settlement of SA debt, and commitment to not sell more STAR within 3 months. Christo Wiese's payment he received was also highly publicised and criticised by media, but the news that it was legal as per Dutch law just slips through certain small prints. I honestly believe the course since December has gone as well as expected. Very little assets sold, no new really bad news has come to light. Many expected bankruptcy by now, but the Steinhoff ship is on course and debts are being settled. Bonds being sold and share price dropping is in my opinion NO indication of additional bad news, but only continued emotional reaction to original news. Big issue obviously liquidity, which is touch-wood being managed. Biggest risk is when AFS will be published. Ons this I also believe that anyone that hoped for a date sooner than June just doesn't understand the situation, and June would be best case scenario. Impact of time-delay should have only affected the price towards end of year. Please feel free to add any material issues/risks that have surfaced that I am unaware of. Question to you Sarel:Is there any info available or published regarding the money owed to SNH by Star, or an expectation of when Star will repay the loan, which would help with liquidity?Thanks again for all the valuable info.Regards,James",

I mean, the deal was broken up and payments were reversed (325m EUR) ?",
"Hi Sarel. I will be attending the Cape Town live stream of the AGM on 20 April, and it got me thinking as to the purpose of the AGM. I wonder if the Board was a bit hasty in setting the date, and the reason for setting that specific date, especially if no Financial Statements will be discussed at this meeting. As far as I checked their was no obligation or deadline to schedule the AGM this soon, since Frankfurt has given the ""thumbs up"" so to speak in terms of the continued listing of the Group. My thinking is there will be a lot of screaming and shouting taking place and finger pointing, which will lead to further weakness in the share price. Quite possible that the company will also quantify some more skeletons as this is a more appropriate platform to communicate the news. Overall, I guess what I'm asking is that we are most likely only going to see more weakness in the next 2 weeks since the AGM will only deliver some more bad news. it is not as if the company can communicate anything substantial on the positive side without the PWC Report being finalized as this would be seen as jumping the gun.",

"http://on.ft.com/2BQhCdg December 15, 2017.Wall Street banks including Bank of America and Citigroup are facing potential losses of more than €1bn on loans made to the billionaire backer of Steinhoff International, the South Africa-based home retailer whose shares collapsed last week after disclosing accounting irregularities. The banks lent €1.6bn to then Steinhoff chairman Christo Wiese in September 2016, which was secured against €3.2bn worth of Mr Wiese’s shares in the company, according to public documents issued by Steinhoff.However, the value of Mr Wiese’s shares pledged against the debt has plummeted sharply with the 80 per cent plunge in Steinhoff’s share price, which has wiped €10bn off its market capitalisation since last Tuesday. This has left the value of the stock held against the loans at less than €400m.That means that Mr Wiese’s collateral on the margin loan — which allowed him to borrow money to invest using his shares as security — is worth far less than his debt to the banks.The margin loan was assembled by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Nomura, and later extended to a broader set of institutions including Bank of America.People familiar with the structure of the agreement said that they were non-recourse, meaning that Mr Wiese’s other assets and holdings could not be seized by the banks to pay back the loan. Wall Street banks including Bank of America and Citigroup are facing potential losses of more than €1bn on loans made to the billionaire backer of Steinhoff International, the South Africa-based home retailer whose shares collapsed last week after disclosing accounting irregularities. The banks lent €1.6bn to then Steinhoff chairman Christo Wiese in September 2016, which was secured against €3.2bn worth of Mr Wiese’s shares in the company, according to public documents issued by Steinhoff.However, the value of Mr Wiese’s shares pledged against the debt has plummeted sharply with the 80 per cent plunge in Steinhoff’s share price, which has wiped €10bn off its market capitalisation since last Tuesday.

These were issued as the company struck deals to acquire Mattress Firm in the US and Poundland in the UK.The margin loan was assembled by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Nomura, and later extended to a broader set of institutions including Bank of America.People familiar with the structure of the agreement said that they were non-recourse, meaning that Mr Wiese’s other assets and holdings could not be seized by the banks to pay back the loan. Given the sudden and unexpected drop, the normal triggers built into such structures to protect banks from a loss did not kick into place.BofA has the largest net exposure to the loan of between €300m and €400m, while Citigroup’s exposure is more than €200m, according to several people following the situation.Goldman Sachs and HSBC are exposed to about €120m each, while BNP Paribas has roughly €100m. JPMorgan Chase, Nomura and UBS are also exposed, these people said. Some of the lenders involved in the margin loan already sold their shares. Steinhoff late on Thursday announced that banks enforced the sale of 98.4m shares, less than 16 per cent of the 628m Steinhoff’s shares Mr Wiese pledged as collateral in 2016.",

Then Jooste left and has not been heard from since and then PWC was brought in quite fast. Say a PWC team worked throughout the holidays, day and night, combing through Steinhoff's various acquistions apart from this identified problem, just to make sure they could confidently say ""something"" on the accounts.

"Dear mr. Sarel, thank you so much for an excellent article; I made a purchase just before and after christmas, in total very close to the daily trading of + 40 eurocents as I focused on the underlying businesses. This is what made me think this is not another Enron, as the doomsday profeters including Bloomberg were quick to use as metaphor. We will know much more in a week or so; if it goes under I will think of your sober arguments which right now make me feel the odds are ok. Greetings from Copenhagen",

"About the main owner’s forced sell; didn’t he have around 30% of the shares and they were forcibly sold by the banks in December, finding few buyers and thereby being a big contributor in this significantly lower share price? Isn’t this a big win for all hedgies that were short this name for a long time?",
"Thanks Sarel, very insightful article. I entered a position at EUR 0.36 and am considering to sell.I agree with your points on the individual units raising independent financing which is a strong sign. My main worry is around the CFO and treasury team - the CFO is still in place (noting its in a different position) and the Financial manager leading the UK subsidiary (that also owns/operates the French sub where the issue may be largest..) is taking over to become CFO. I can't see a logic behind this? Any thoughts?",

Thank you for this article Sarel. It was very informative. I have made the decision to buy this stock with a substantial amount at 50 eurocents. My logic was that Steinhoff is just too big too fail and they will manage to sell assets to help improve liquidity. Some person told me: Isn't this Steinhoff scenario exactly as what happened with Royal Imtech. What are your views on this Sarel?,
Haven’t they previously stated that the fraud relates to EUR6bn in assets ? So if they’d had to write that entire amount down there’d still be c. EUR10bn in book equity or is there something I’m missing ?,
What about all the lawsuits that will follow after the false sense anouncements issued by the company in 2016/17.This company will suffer endless difficulties in the years ahead dealing with the mess they created issueing fraudulent financial statements signed off by Deloitte,
"I did consulting work for a business unit of Steinhoff both before its acquisition and afterwards: it is true some of the overseas businesses are well run, in a good market position, have a solid balance sheet and very nice cash flows. But it is also true that many other business units are not that well managed, suffer from abysmal vertical integration, have been overvalued - and one thing still not being well understood is that Steinhoff's reported debt of €10.7b may not be a true reflection of all its obligations for every business unit.IMO, Steinhoff has tried to copy IKEA as ""best it can"" and whilst it has in some ways succeeded, it has had one huge failing: it is not a single brand, but a myriad of acquisitions (many brought in very recently) that are operationally indepedent. That creates a huge overweight of costs in managing all these different brand strategies and marketing them; complicated and unreliable supply chains and especially a host of different IT back ends that are often way out of date and don't talk to each other: there is no real group visibility as such. This is likely a big part of the reason why PwC and Alix Partners will take a long time to untangle the mess and give some clarity as to the real state of affairs.The one advantage I guess is that these businesses are relatively self sustaining so some may prove both desirable to buy and easy to get rid of. But overall, Steinhoff is simply a structural orgy of debt and deceit.",Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. Strategic Analysis: Blood In The Streets

"Found this on and Investor Village post by biotech2k:We have been talking about valuations lately. Here is an amazing opportunity to compare 3 very like minding companies on valuations:The current valuations and next years sales:ACAD $3.5 billion market cap with $250 million sales in 2018SAGE $7.0 billion market cap with $0 sales in 2018NBIX $7.0 billion market cap with $355 million sales in 2018Peak potentials:ACAD could do over $7 billion in Dementia related psychosis with over 1 million patientsSAGE could do $1 billion in SAGE-547 and $5 billion in MDD for $6 billion peak salesNBIX could do $2 billion for Ingrezza and another $2 billion for Elagolix for $4 billion peaks sales. When you compare all there of these companies, you see the glaring valuation miss price of ACAD vs it comparable competitors. None of these companies overlap in indications. All have about the same peak potential. All are about the same stage of development. This is why I think ACAD is a screaming buy.",

"Good chance of 52 week low this week, which is a pretty good bearish signal for the year.  Axon failure good indication of potential failure for acad since similar molecule.

A recent article on SA mentioned AXON has a few data reads later this month which might be holding back share price. What are your thoughts on the impact AXON might have on ACAD if data is positive?,
'Significant dilution',
"As a few posters above alluded, we feel ACAD will be a great trading vehicle with emphasis on the short side for a few years to come, at least to mid 19'.Sales for PDP are far from blockbuster and wouldn't be surprised to them decelerate over the next few years.Near term short catalysts could include a significant solution to feed their cash burn and also a positive read from Axovant this month.  Bolstering the slide may be negative reads from the shorter studies like schizo and depression(of course these could read positive and add a few bucks to the SP).  On a positive side they could also reach full enrollment for the DRP study much faster than the two years they forecasted in Oct.  However if it takes that long for the study just to start, then there won't be a read for 3 years and even then, since it failed to meet secondary endpoints previously, there is a solid chance it won't get approved which would be a moment of short mania.We simply feel this symbol is essentially a great trading vehicle between 25 and 40 and should continue to be for the foreseeable future.  It is also nearly guaranteed that when management speaks next they will include some unforeseen negative tidbit that will initiate another slide to 25. Finger on the short button, maybe not so much for the Feb call but more likely for Q1 results.We would short right around here again however waiting for the predictable BO rumor they initiate just prior to a dilution.",
"You make a good case on Acad evaluations if the all possibilities came to fruition. However, this is the 'bio-tech world', and the odds of Nuplazid in DRP getting FDR approval is far from certain and far into the future. The burn rate is a real issue as the Baker Boys know well after propping up the company big time a couple of years ago, and current Nuplazid in PDP sales in 2017 of a $127 million is far from $2.4 Billion peak sales.  So, banking on miracles is normal when investing in bio-tech, but miracles are few and far between. The share price reflects this reality.",
"Purchased a year ago right at this SP when hype was BO, did not happen and it’s not even on the BO radar hype so far this year.   BB will hold for max bid, they know what they have in ACAD, but less anxious investors like me don’t want to wait another year.  Looks to be a range trader for those that choose to play that game.  Maybe good ER report gets to mid $30’s but without BO hype I don’t think we see $40’s soon.   Will hold core and consider swing trades $28’s-$30.xx or maybe the range goes to $30-34 after ER.  Disappointed and missed out on 2017 swings to $40.",
the results are not due until a year plus from now. why did you not include that in your article. critically important fact there. that's if they expedite or release news earlier than expected. appreciate the article but I think the main price appreciation aside from pdp uptake is the lead up to release of results 3rd qtr 2019. Lots can happen between now and then. ACAD sold off for this reason primarily.,
long time investor very disappointing so far. July of 2015 was 51.99 now with all the positive things like nuplazid approval and sales of about 125m last year and maybe 200m+ this year stock is dead extremely disappointing. Anyone who follows it closely knows that the baker brothers who control the company want more than the market is willing to pay now. Until they get approval[s] for the other indications and then get a bo offer stock will just languish. What this is worth is hard to determine but when that is stock will be worth considerably more.,
i picked up more shares yesterday....we have a real blockbuster and franchise drug on our hands as Uli used to say......i am patiently watching  little ACAD that no one thought could make it on its own transform into a CNS powerhouse.....hat off to the BB brothers for not selling ACAD for peanuts and undertaking this project to unlock full value....,

"Tesla fans and bulls seemingly have not been aware of the changes going on in the EV world. Tesla's much promoted charging supercharger network and speed of recharge and driving ranges have all been, or soon will be, shattered. The CCS charging protocol is uprated to 350KW and 500KW, compared to Tesla's supercharger 140KW, allowing a prototype Porsche Mission e to demonstrate the ability of their car to recharge more than twice as fast as Tesla. Porsche has offered their charging technology to any and all automakers. CCS is obviously going to become the world standard and 350KW stations are right now being installed coast to coast by EvGo and by a consortium for European automakers in Europe. OIl companies are also  buying charging companies to installchargers in their gas stations. What's worse, the Chevy Bolt has a significantly greater drivingrange than the base Model 3. Its acceleration, for an SUV,  does not trail the base Model 3 by much and is plenty fast enough for a car of its type. SUVs are NOT sold or bought on the basis of acceleration numbers.  There have been announcements by the world's automakers of more than 120 electric cars coming to market in the next few years.

Lithium ion is too expensive to be competitive with existing IC engines and, as has been highlighted by the Apple iPhone storm, lacks the durability necessary to meet even a fraction of the current 11-plus year average lifespan of an automobile. General Motors and other mainstream carmakers have the financial resources to indulge the fantasies of green advocates and green-minded governments, but small start-ups, like Tesla, will never be able to amass the necessary capital to stay in the game for the long term.",

"@JohnThat was probably the best written short thesis article i've seen on here. Please keep up the good work. As a long i am always interested in hearing both sides of the story so it's refreshing to see an analysis presented in such a mature and well written way.  Most of the bears have the facts straight but i'm unsure as to why they must resort to belittling anyone with a more optimistic opinion of unknown future events. The immaturity only serves to discredit their anaylsis and opinions.I am well aware of the limited cash runway facing Tesla. I am well aware of the expiring debt obligations. I am well aware of the risk they are taking by betting the farm and running so close to the edge. I am well aware of the warning flags presented by ramp up delays. it is true that this valuation is not a traditional one and it is also true that the probability of them ramping to 5k/wk is not a certainty. But the thing i do understand is that there is market demand for a company to operate this aggresively with this particular mission statement. There is a market demand for a company to pioneer at all costs. There is a market demand for a company led by someone they believe to be altruistic and visonary. This social attitude toward corporate purpose is all around us in the age of tech.We live in a world where the next generation doesn't care about cars the same way previous generations did. This generation is getting used to a level a tech and smart products that make analog switches and dials laughable to them. It's a generation with enough tech around them to have the real information they need in spite of what corporate interests try to force feed them through advertising. Reviews, likes, and reputation count more. Real time citizen reviews are published to youtube unfiltered by automakers influence.This generation wants what is possible not what is profitable for corporations. They are comfotable crowdfunding unproven products and unproven pioneers. It's part of the zeigeist we are witnessing.As long as there is market demand for a company that this generation can crowdfund to get done what no other companies are willing to do the money will be there. The upside is a better future, the down side risk is a few bucks each for a generation looking for a better option.A delay in manufacturing is also par for the course.  “[t]he complexities of the manufacturing and shipping process can sometimes delay the delivery time of vehicles to the dealership.  While it is in the best interest of all concerned to streamline this process, material shortages and delays in shipping by outside sources, as well as internal plants and foundry divisions, are some of the major contributing factors we must deal with in the automotive industry. In addition, market demands for popular models sometimes exceed our production capabilities.”I'll give you one guess what company wrote that. The preceeding quote was GM's email reply to a customer about bolt's current lack of availabilty in Canada.Not sure why tesla gets criticized for using this explanation but GM gets a pass. Is tesla the only one that is supposed to be immune to delays? There is a big difference between a company being transparent and giving real time updates and a company that buffers with the sole purpose of preserving shareholder value. There is a market for companies that are honest about delays.In terms of competition a look at the 2017 scorecard for EVs in the US paints a pretty promising picture for m3. In Dec m3 outsold all but 5 vehicles and even sold more in one month than 18 vehicles sold all year by various major auto makers. M3 Increased sales while other established automakers struggled with flat or decreasing sales. Tesla ramped faster than honda and they had the same 6 months from production start date.When the government won't subsidize what the people want, they do it themselves. Call it charity or call it crowdfunding or call it a donation. That's what the market is demanding and tesla will have the cash to keep going. Plenty of silicon valley money floating around and even more retail money who aren't afraid of a small share dilution if it gets them the product they want in the end.  That alone makes the bear thesis risky too.",
"However bullish someone might have been on the company, the continued delaying and therefore massive cash drain just dilutes current shareholders rapidly. It was bad enough that they were paying the employees in stock and diluting ownership and doing equity offerings. But when does it stop. If you liked the company 3 years ago, you have to be 20-40% less optimistic on dilution and debt alone. Even if the story WAS intact, dilution makes it less so financially to shareholders. And now you start to quetsion what return on assets and equity would ever be to justify the share price. They have only $5 billion in equity and $28 billion in assets. Even if they had an absurdly favorable 300% return on equity, that would be $15 billion profit and $10/share earnings, a 30x valuation! And 50% ROA. And the bulls say it could go higher? Really?",
"Well written article pointing out the growing risks for Tesla.  Being a former banker, their numbers would scare me to death if I were extending credit lines to either Tesla or their vendors.1.  Teslas strategy to use trade credit with abnormal terms cries desperation regarding their cash burn rate.  Trade credit can only go so far before their vendors get stretched as well. 2.  Tesla’s delayed ramp may actually reduce their cash drain in the short run giving them more time to operate without a capital raise but does nothing to help reduce operating losses.3.  Bankers for both Tesla and their trades are going to take a tougher stance on credit terms if they are acting prudently.  As trades max their lines to support Tesla, bankers will move to reduce risk through tougher repayment terms leading to a further squeeze on Teslas finances.  4.  Tesla may have missed it’s window to raise more capital because 3rd and 4th quarter numbers will show a deteriorating financial picture, probably too poor to get any interest in my opinion.",
"""Getting to the level of Model 3 production needed to be profitable - if it ever will be - will require billions more in investment...""How do you know this? It's easy to say $1B/quarter in capital equipment continues forever, but if the Model 3 ramp is delayed by 6 months, the equipment needed for 5-10k/week ramp can also be delayed 6 months.

Does GM even have a plan to make 5k/week? If so, when? From 800 to 1,250/week over 6 months is a very slow ramp.

"TSLA/Musk cannot generate a profit.  Anyone that would lend TSLA money won't be a conventional lender and 'hard money' cannot see a future where high interest will be paid.

Vague promises that things are great and getting better won't cut the ice w/o a reasonable degree of Earnings.  TSLA will never get to the point, IMO.

"To Author:""Tesla's great strength has been its ability to seemingly warp reality - or at least the perception thereof - to its advantage. It has built up a powerful mystique and remarkably strong brand. Elon Musk still commands a cult-like adoration from a vast swathe of the public in his own right.

Yet, neither charisma nor branding and marketing savvy can sustain a company forever. Eventually, the music will stop. What exactly the catalyst will remain unclear.

hey josh nice article. i am curious where you got the 12% eps growth on the projected .50 full year eps.,
Just got an alert that the CEO bought 10k shares at $5.56 today,
"These guys need to ramp up stock buy backs now, not contract them",
I bought FRAN today as it looks to me like it wants to stop dropping now and start going up.,
"You can find the latest ICR conference presentation here:http://bit.ly/2qGwYfrHas anyone gone to this conference? The CEO says he wants to expand from 700 stores to 900 stores. As a shareholder, I find this preposterous. How about keeping the number of stores constant? i.e. You can add a new store if you eliminate one.",

"Kinda amazing to me the author did not address the elephant-in-the-room issue: fewer people want to shop there.Over the past few months I've visited several FRAN stores in different states with my female companions.  Their impressions have been unanimously ""meh"" ... stores are a weird hodgepodge ... very unclear who FRAN's target market is, teenagers or 20's or 30's? ... career ladies or soccer moms?FRAN is being run by bean counters, not marketers ...",

If teenagers consider this is not trendy anymore, this could be worse. I hope you end up well! Good luck!",
"I thought I sold FRAN for $7.3 about a few weeks ago for a small profit. Didn't realize that it is still sitting in my portfolio when it pops up as the biggest loser today. I must have dreamt that I sold FRAN or maybe I forgot to press the confirm transaction button. I was so sure that I sold it that I even turn off the email alert for it. Now, I am stuck holding this rotting garage in my portfolio. What a blunder. Should I sell at a serious loss or hold and pray. What a headache.",
"Please prove that FRAN pays ""40% in income tax"" on its profits. Most companies have a much lower effective tax rate than the top rate, especially companies with falling profits like this one. So please show us where on the company's latest earnings statement it shows it paid 40% on income taxes.",

GE’s reinsurance write-off is more a reflection of what already been written off in GNW’s legacy products. It is more a lagging indicator.,
GE's $15 billion write down ($6 billion upfront) of its GE Capital business announced today is a DISASTER for GNW.  Most of these losses appear connected to LTC policies GE has insured or reinsured.   Remember GNW was spun out of GE.   Genworth's accountants are also looking at the books including LTC.  Looks like a big write-off coming.  Maybe big enough to drive off the Chinese.,
"I would just note that if someone is looking for an insurance stock, selling below book, and has good prospects because of an improving environment for recovery, AEG seems a better bet.  Pays a decent dividend while waiting.",

any chance the 2018 debt is defaulted?,
"You can have a high book value but still trapped in a liquidity crisis. In other words, it is a liquidity issue not a insolvency issue. All management has to do in the event OC deal killed is to sell MI assets to unlock GNW value, pay off debt , put LTC into state receivership , and have rest holding company run off, then shareholders may even get more than $5.43. Do you think Fed and State would like this scenario? Of course not, so what are they going to do? They are going to approve merger with OC, bingo!  So why CEO talked down the company at shareholder meeting? To make Trump think he got a good deal for America by selling GNW to Chinese.",
"I don’t think the Ocean deal happens based on CIF issues.  While I do believe that gnw has many options to cover debt and create more equity value, this management team is doing a horrible job articulating a plan B detail of options.  Just a horrible circumstance that we have to wait for the inevitable no from CIF and management has articulated no other plans.  Ocean could buy a minority stake in gnw or just buy Australia division, or Canadian, or Life division.  I do note that very large and sophisticated shareholders are not making any noise to the negative and have voted for the deal.  Also, from a GAPP accounting basis, if management clearly says that the market value of the stock is $5.43, then how can they get away w not writing off $15 share of book value? How can they keep the book equity at $20 share when they clearly say that the equity has been severely impaired?",
"Genworth stakeholders have waited far too long for management to act on a strategic plan which allows for the failure of the China deal to materialize. If there is such a plan, it should be presented in detail and evidence provided of its execution. Failure to provide a plan would (and in my opinion, should) open the door for a proxy fight to oust the management team.",
"I don't buy this sum of the parts argument for reasons I covered in other threads, but I respect your opinion. Until GNW totally sheds LTC/Life and disavows it, investors will never assume the other parts are separate.I see you put a 12x operating on US MI, debatable i'm assuming.MI could see weakness in the future, the stock valuations could be unreliable or they might have to take a discount if liquidating 50%+. Debt payments due are not certain could pose risk for shareholders due to muddled structure etc.The gap of a mere 1 billion between market price and best possible upside is way too thin to assume any risks imo. But by all means if you love it at $3, I hope you do well.",
"Thanks for the read SCCM. My interest is not as an investor but as a person with an elderly parent who holds one of those Long Term Care policies.

"Beyond Jan18, the highest open interest call volume is Jan20 5.5.  What to make of that?",
"It is interesting that the 2018, 2020, and 2021 GNW bonds are trading at par. If the situation was dire price action would be telling a much different story. Whenever I consider taking an equity position regardless if its an investment or a binary event scenario, one of the first things I do is look at where debt traders have pinned the bonds since this is a most telling attribute for future prospects.The bonds are saying that GNW will be fine in the short term regardless if this deal falls apart or not.",
as always good point of view seven,
"I'm glad you included the RAD case in your article.  I think it's a great comparison.  I got burned slightly with that trade.  For GNW, instead of the equity, I've taken positions in three of the bonds maturing prior to 2022.  They provide decent yield (better that most dividends).  I'm not sure if you had a position on this.",
"The accountants are in now for the audit report.  We will soon see if LTC takes another big hit.  If it does, then it will be clear LTC has negative value.  I started my career working for the OTS a former bank regulator.  The bank regulators almost always tried to force bank holding companies to inject money into their bank subs if capital was inadequate.  The bank holding companies could fight back legally but they would likely eventually lose. I would be surprised if it wasn’t the same case for insurance holding companies.  GNW’s only way off the hook is to get someone like the Chinese or other moneybags to inject money in return for no future liability.  That appears to be the deal.  If the deal falls through things get dicey.",
"9543151,That actually is A$52mm which is about $40mm USD. Also, 45% of the buyback was already completed at the date of the last quarterly financials.

The most recent one I saw was end of November which only put the buy-back at 50.5% complete. So, you will likely only see a few million more cash at 12/31 from the Australian buyback.",
"Can Shareholders oust the CEO in the next vote? Before, being the majority, the institutional holders were lazy and were betting on the easy BO route. But this time, they should show some responsibilities towards their shareholders.",
I sure want to know what the holding company cash level is on 12/31/2017.  Also note that the Australian mortgage company has a $100M share repurchase plan in place.  This would allow the holding company to sell approximately half as many shares and still maintain its respective ownership position.  Another way to bring $50M to the holding company.  They could do the same thing with Canada and let these foreign mortgage companies go into a sort of runoff to create liquidity.,
"I am pretty confident (and there is good evidence to believe) CFIUS will not clear this deal - hence China Oceanwide is irrelevant.On the SOTP analysis - it boils down to whether you believe regulators believe shareholder equity belongs to the LTC policy holders or not, in the event the doodoo hits the fan.  LTC is an enormously difficult business to value - if you read the 10K, you'll see that a 25bps reduction in the discount rate applied to LTC liabilities is worth about $2bn, or to put it anouther way 25% more than the entire market cap today.  Anyone that does SOTP analysis must be confident of the LTC liability discount rate to way better than 25bps, OR they believe the regulators will let the shareholders off the hook.  Both of these seem doubtful to me.And to be clear, I am not saying GNW is over or undervalued - I'm saying anyone who says confidently one or the other is doing so by making what to me seem questionable assumptions.  Good luck to all.",
"Excellent point about the C-Suite executives being incentivized to take this deal via golden parachutes, payouts, and continued ""consultant"" work at the new company if merger goes through. Total conflict of interest.",
"There's another reason why the CEO badmouthed the value of the company x the merger. It is an attempt to convince the regulators that policy holders could be in jeopardy. This is probably not a mere bluff, but a realistic concern for regulators.",

"""If this is not possible, GNW could simply let these subsidiaries run off over time and shareholders would receive any residual value remaining once the claims are fully paid.""You do realize that GLIC and GLAIC have LTC liabilities that will be running off over the next 50 or so years, right?

"Gino, my distinct recollection is the CFO said in the Q4 conference call that they do NOT see opportunities for refinancing debt in fiscal 2018.  That delays things another year, until the next call adjustments in spring of 2019, for them to “show what they are made of,” and reduce interest rates.   And that is going to be a considerably less advantageous interest rate market.  I like the stock, but I like it less than I did at $2, and have a considerably smaller position than I did, owing to opportunity cost in other situations.  Also, I found the Q4 release modestly disappointing.  I thought the acquisition would have helped them a tad more.   Meanwhile, I think you are a bit optimistic on your revenue estimates, and your FCF numbers, going forward.  The company paying cash taxes is not something to sneeze at either (debt paydowns will be considerably slower)....and the Trump tax plan also modestly disadvantages the company.",

Great article.  Been watching LEE for a long time and have been long for more than a year under generally the same thesis.,
"I've held LEE since late 2008 when it was selling for 33 cents. It has taken the patience of Job to hang in there, not to mention a near-miraculous shareholder escape from bankruptcy, but here we are, with the debt reduced by nearly two-thirds from the disastrous Pulitzer purchase. It's been bloody, but the company, as noted in the analysis, has kept the cash flowing, and the debt declining, even as the business has faded. Some have characterized LEE's plight as a race to get the debt paid off before the cash flow and business dries up. I disagree with that analysis. There will be a bottoming out of revenue. LEE still operates mostly in smaller markets where the newspapers matter more to their communities, plus the company is aggressively pursuing digital gains and alternate streams of income. Sooner or later, and I think it's sooner, Mr. Market will recognize this and realize the ""Newspaper are dead"" narrative is premature, if not just plain wrong in many smaller markets.",
Stephen Spicer called LEE a buy too.Its a buy at these levels.,
"Gino, thanks for your writeup.  I held LEE for two decades both before and after the Pulitzer deal.  The reason I held after the Pulitzer transaction - which in hindsight, was clearly a mistake - was for exactly the reasons you laid out in your article.  Basically, this is a publicly traded LBO.  As the debt gets paid down, the stock price should move dramatically upwards.  Unfortunately, the market hasn't reflected that and the stock has been stuck in the low single digits.  I got tired of waiting and took my loss last year.  I have a fond place in my heart for small town newspapers but despite heroic efforts by management to cut costs and pay down debt, the secular trends against them are just too big to overcome.

One can cruise for substantially less than that... and the cruise ship provides INFINITELY better food, entertainment, and socialization.

"BOA?  It is an organization that plays fast and loose with the law and it's fiduciary responsibilities to Americans.  William Bossen has had a two year long journey in trying to get redemption on a Bank Note that his Grandfather bought for him in 1980, in commemoration of Will’s birth and for future savings. The existence of this Bank Bond was not disclosed to Will, until he found it several years ago it in a safe deposit box when settling his mother’s estate. The bank that issued the note was inevitably acquired by Bank of America. By legal banking standards Bank of America acquired the liabilities of the bank it assumed and is responsible for the payment of the obligation, however they are refusing to pay based on not having any record of the original transaction in 1980. The note clearly states that all that is needed is the original Bank Bill in order to redeem. Outside of the financial repercussions to William and having his Grandfather’s wish honored, this is another personal example to all of us that the financial industry is not upholding its legal obligations. Not only is Bank of America not paying the accrued interest of this debt obligation, but they essentially have stolen the $20K ($50K in today’s money) principal that was used to secure it.This is an individual representation of us as the “retail public” being taken advantage of and happens to many of us all of the time. http://bit.ly/2F67ZFH http://kng5.tv/2qubCBK http://bit.ly/2F96kiE",

"Hey Fun, what's your take on DO price action? do you see a sustained break over $20 or a pullback?",
"Hi Fun,Good article on DO!  While DO does have the 2nd strongest BS in the industry (after RDC), I think any investor has to discount that strength to some degree due to their poor fleet.  What I mean by that is that you pointed out in this article that other OSD’s such as RIG and ESV (and I would add even NE) have already spent capital to upgrade their fleets, while DO has not.Thus eventually DO is going to have to spend $$ to either build new rigs or make an acquisition.  Their management team seems to be in no hurry to do so, as I feel they believe that the industry is going to take longer to turn (based on management comments).  However, to be a survivor, DO will eventually had to add more modern DS’s or semis.In reality, DO is taking a big haircut on the Ocean Valor’s original day rates in order to keep this rig working.  I understand the desire to keep a customer relationship, and to keep the rig “hot” till 2020.  By being a working rig, the OV will be in a better position to get a new, and hopefully higher day rate contract when it rolls off this one.Best regards, and hope your 2018 is off to a great start!",

The only reason why preferred shareholders haven't hit the dirt as hard as common shareholders is because they lack liquidity. So day traders do not trade preferreds cause they cannot manipulate the stock price as easily as they can with the common. Day traders know nothing about the courts or what is really going on behind the scenes in the government. They follow charts and that is why you never see traders checking the charts for preferred shares. There just is not enough liquidity there.The propaganda against the common shareholders is coming from the banksters who want to shut down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They want to bring the common PPS back to pennies so that they can argue in court that most Americans are no longer interested in saving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholders. If the banksters get what they want the courts will feel that they won't hurt anyone by reissuing new stock and deleting the old stock. This is what happened in the energy sector.The preferred shareholders who tell you that these shares will be converted into the new shares. Won't tell you that they will receive something like .03% of the shares. Its highly unlikely that these people own the amount of shares they claim they own by using leverage cause the case of FNMA FMCC has dragged on long enough to create a margin call. Ask these people to show you a screen shot of their holdings. They can block all important information and just show what they own. They will never do it.So what is the logic behind the constant attacks on the common. They want to either shut down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or they want new shares issued to the banksters. Why? Isn't it obvious by now that these people work for them. Why else would they remove anyone who posts something contrary to what they post? They are becoming desperate which is why they are censoring those voices who oppose their will. Never give up and become as active as you can. Also bring others on board since the stock price is now low enough to bring in a ton of people into this fight. If the banksters win this one they will control the entire housing market and turn us all into slaves. Look at how cold its been in America lately. Do you really want the banksters to control the entire housing industry? There won't be enough shelters to accommodate all the homelessness if the banksters do get to control the entire housing market.,

"Let's give the Feds the benefit of the doubt and assume that the 2008-09 conservatorship was made in good faith in a moment of crisis. Under that assumption, at that time the Feds' goals were to reassure the markets of the creditworthiness of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) while not explicitly taking control of the GSEs. Taking control would have necessitated the inclusion of the GSEs liabilities on the Federal balance sheet and risked all of the political repercussions thereof during that moment of crisis.The Feds did this by (a) placing the GSEs in conservatorship under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), thereby removing the common shareholders board representation, voting rights and claims on the GSEs assets; (b) providing a line of credit in exchange for warrants amounting to 79.9 percent of the ownership of the GSEs (an amount just under the control threshold under government accounting rules); and (c) using the line of credit to purchase preferred shares that would be senior to all other securities to ensure the repayment of the capital yet not be counted as ownership equity; and (d) barring the GSEs from raising any non-Fed capital, foreclosing any chance of displacing the SP shareholder. In addition to the warrants the Feds would be compensated by a 10 percent interest payment on the value of the preferred shares.  Draconian terms, but so far so good and goals achieved. The initial structure of the senior preferred shares (SP) could be interpreted as debt and not equity as the SP shares hold no voting rights; have an agreed upon return; do not participate in the economic benefits of the business; and have no claim on GSE assets beyond their notional value. Further, the Feds not consolidating the GSE financials is an implicit claim that though they have effectively seized control of the GSE shareholders' discretion over the company through the FHA under HERA, they have not taken over economic control as the common shareholders may still be able to participate in economic gains beyond the SP interest and principal payments. Move to August 2012. A moment of calm and not crisis. Even as Federal officials politically prep for a national election they institute the ""net worth sweep"" which requires that the GSEs pay all of their earnings to the SP holders as a dividend; retain limited capital; not credit any of the payment beyond the 10 percent contractual interest to principal and instead credit excess payments as interest. In short the GSEs were placed in ""debt bondage""; The debt could not be repaid and that would forever bar the non-SP holders from seeing any economic gains through their ownership in the GSEs. Through the NW sweep actions the Feds had taken effective ownership of both the shareholder rights to have a voice in the management of the GSEs and the control of the GSE assets through that management and all economic benefits that the two GSEs accrued through their operations. Through the NW sweep the Feds now -- in fact, if not in name -- owned 100 percent of the GSEs by taking 100 percent of the rights and privileges of the common shareholders based upon centuries of common and corporate law.Logically, because of the terms of the NW sweep, the GSEs should have been consolidated into the Federal budget at the time of the NW sweep implementation. The fact that the consolidation did not happen and that the GSEs continued to file independent financial statements is either (a) an admission by the Federal government that the common shareholders still own the company and will eventually have their voting, management and economic rights restored (including the right to repay the SP loans and raise new capital) when the conservatorship is ended, or (b) a political fraud perpetrated on the GSE shareholders, U.S. bondholders and voters intended to hide the actual indebtedness of the U.S. government in order for those committing the fraud to retain control of both the GSE cash flows and their elected offices in the 2012, 2014 and 2016 elections along with the pay, perks and privileges of those positions. Further, if (b) is true and shareholders and U.S. bondholders relied on the Treasury's lack of consolidation of the GSEs as a good faith statement as part of their decision to purchase shares and Federal debt, the Sec. of the Treasury may have violated New York's Martin Act and committed criminal fraud. Most recently, the Treasury Sec and conservator agreed to allow the GSEs to retain part of their Q4 sweep payment to maintain some capital. In this case the sweep was not waived, instead the capital is being exchanged for additional SP shares. The Feds are stating that common shareholders continue to have no economic benefits and rights in the GSE businesses and no say in how the businesses are governed and that they remain barred from repaying the SP loans. In short, their debt bondage continues. An alternative course of action would have been for the NW sweep to be ended and any earnings beyond the 10 percent interest to be retained by the GSEs. Importantly, the alternate course was not taken.The decision by Sec. Mnuchin to continue the NW sweep at this juncture and also to continue to not consolidate the GSEs  financials with those of the U.S. Treasury suggests that the Martin Act fraud is continuing and evolving to this day. Further, that the Treasury continues to not redeem any existing SP shares for payments beyond the 10 percent coupon though the change in administrations implicate the new administration in the fraudulent claim the the GSEs are not owned by the Feds each time financial statements are filed with the SEC and each time the U.S. budget is published for the people's review.As the NY attorney general Eric Schneiderman is a Democrat and devout anti-Trumper, I do not expect he is investigating the case under the Martin Act as it has heretofore involved only the Obama administration, Jack Lew and Timothy Geithner. Yet, with the new amendment and publication of the U.S. government's books this year, Schneiderman's seemingly has a golden opportunity to one-up Mueller and be the first to charge Trump and Co. with something criminal. Schneiderman's attempt to use the Martin Act against Exxon is proof that he knows of the laws existence and that it is not a dead letter. Of course, I have as much faith in Schneiderman's ability to see the opportunity and act as I do in his impartiality in the enforcement of the law so far during his tenure.  For Mnuchin, the only ethical way to end the fraud would either be to state that the Geithner, Lew decisions were incorrect and restore the pre-NW sweep status properly crediting past payments to the Treasury as interest and principal and stating the true value of the SP shares on the Federal balance sheet; or to acknowledge the Fed ownership of the GSEs and consolidate their financials. This is a test of ethics and I do not see anyone passing.",

Hey Glenn how about a follow up to your article (this one).  You hit the mother nerve cord with this one,
"The 2016 Balance Sheet shows Assets of $3.29 Trillion. Liabilities of $3.287 Trillion, leaving the equity at $.03 Trillion ($3 billion). If these numbers are accurate, there is nothing there for common shareholders. I have to question the accuracy of the numbers, as when I added the individual assets I came with only $177.598 billion. I would also note that whatever the assets are there is little chance of getting the $3.29 trillion as the supply will overwhelm the demand for what may be some doggy assets. Thus the problem with receivership. The liabilities are real and won't be covered by sale of the assets. The losers here are the debt holders. Liquidate the assets and only a percentage of the liabilities will be covered. If so, the junior preferred are toast too. Forget receivership. Conservatorship is the right course. From there, year by year, interest on debt and debt maturity need be honored, the senior preferred paid a reasonable return, with junior preferreds paid and if  anything is lefftover to retained equity.",

"With a little time to digest this here are some additional thoughts:1. Glen provided a very telling audio clip of Secretary Watt answering questions from Corker in testimony several months ago where Corker was blatantly trying to goad Watt into forcing Fannie and Freddy to take on a few billion in additional capital ""just to be safe"". With the knowledge that Corker despises their existence his motive was clear, in taking a draw from Treasury a decade after the GSE's were put in conservatorship he would argue they are still wards of the state not worthy of existing. IE: Corker was POSTURING in his debate about forcing the GSE's to draw from Treasury. 2. This thumbnail sketch of kill the GSE's off and re-distribute their functions to the pure(er) free market banks is Corker POSTURING to create a sense of this being the inevitable plan.3. Per my previous post on this article this is ALL about an ideological battle over the governments role in the housing market and there IS a sound ""long term"" case for doing away with the GSE's. Without the GSE's guarantees the 30 year mortgage would not exist. With a 15 year mortgage being the only option home prices would crash to the point where they would equalize with home owners ability to make monthly payments on a 15 year mortgage. For arguments sake lets say home prices get cut in half going from 30 year mortgages to 15 year (more complicated than this but good enough for discussion). The argument is under pure free market forces lifetime housing expense would be substantially less and that money could be spent elsewhere in the economy. Since rents have to compete with home ownership they would also come way down.4. We just had a real life experience with how a drastic downward re-set in home prices affects the over all economy and it was unbelievably painful. So let's look at what information we have about how Corker plans to handle the transition from GSE's to purer(er) free market force banks or the 30 year mortgage to the 15 year mortgage. I can't copy and paste the quote from Glen's article so here is a paraphrase version: Wipe out the GSE's existing capital structure and re-IPO them to raise new capitalThey will be ""under government control"" until new competitors enter the mortgage-finance market.Their Federal Charters are to be repealed (when?)So the GSE's can guarantee 30 year mortgages because of their implied backing from the U.S. government. When their charter is repealed so is their implied backing and the 30 year mortgage. So based on the information above after wiping out current GSE shareholders the newco will seek to raise capital from new shareholders in a company that will be under government control until there is enough competition from big banks that they have no competitive advantage. Good luck with that. More importantly the grand plan to transition the economy from a 30 year mortgage based housing market to a 15 year mortgage based housing market depends on the unanswered question of whether the newco will be structured to continue backing the 30 year mortgage in which case we just went through a Rube Goldberg restructuring to wind up exactly where we started or if it will only be able to guarantee a 15 year mortgage and we let the chips fall where they may in this MASSIVE restructuring of a significant portion of the nations economy.Finally Mnuchin has already weighed in on this topic stating that the GSE's have provided a vital function in the housing market over their history and something to the effect the issues that lead to their conservatorship should not obscure their longer term record. The ""Plan"" being discussed is Corker posturing to create a sense of inevitability for this plan. Based on Mnuchin's praise for the GSE's long term role in the housing market he understands the basic issue how do you go from a 30 year mortgage based housing market to a 15 year mortgage based housing market without wreaking havoc on the economy in the short and mid terms. If you were to start a housing market from scratch Corkers is probably the way to go. Unfortunately that ship sailed long ago.",
Let me give you my perspective:1. CW 2.0 does protect tax payers by spinning off $5T balance sheet 2. It resolves all lawsuits by paying PFD in full 3. Maintains 30 year mortgage with explicit gov backing 4. Maintains securitization platform 6. Protects GSE employees 7. Makes money for tax payers 8. End conservatorship What it has not done is caring for the commons by explaining how it supports the new skeleton GSEs with a new name. That remains to be seenWhat it,
Glen - Technical question of the economics - Do the Preferred's have a $195 billion liquidation preference or just a $ 1 billion dollar liquidation preference? The initial 2008 bailout fact sheet only shows a $ 1 billion dollar liquidation preference but this is confusing as we know the government claims the GSEs have not paid off the $195 billion bailout (link below).  Can u clarify?http://bit.ly/2F3uNWx,
Does someone expected something different from Corker and Warner?,
"Ppl need to wake up. 280B balance with the treasury. 190B for govt, 33B for the preferred. 57B remains for common. In liquidation that amounts to $24/share. Plus have to compensate for all intellectual property.  Plus plenty of lawsuits dealing with fraud as the govt isn’t even acting in the best interest of citizens who have 80% stake in GSE. GSE are a safe investment",
I hear the 360 pound woman  warming up her vocals,
Who owned the senior preferreds ? Please list all the owner and volume here.,
"I have 2 questionswhy Corker/Warner? why the reform bill be written by these two guys?""In one the commons fall in price to $1.85 and the preferred rise to 65% of par. ""and how can be $1.85 in commons? I'm curious about the commons wouldn't be 0 in the worst situation. thank you!",
"My understanding is that Corker and Warner want to zero out the value of the commons and pay the preferreds out at par.  As a holder of commons this scares me.Here's my 2 other issues, though, and I'd love feedback from any of you on this.   1) when Mnuchin says he wants to make sure the taxpayers are never again at risk, I read that as bearish for the stock, as if he wants to see the market go to private banks.  I don't trust the guy.  Am I misinterpreting his comments?  I said months ago that I didn't trust him and he's done nothing to date to change my mind.  He's a Goldman alum so I wouldn't be surprised to see him screw the shareholders to benefit his buddies/former colleagues.  2) What's to stop Corker, his congressional allies and the government from paying the preferred shareholders out at par and zero the commons.  There are 1.2 billion  shares of commons outstanding and govt. has warrants equal to about 80% of them, so about 1 billion shares.  At $10 per share value, that's $10 billion they are giving up but they get paid the value of their senior preferreds ($1 billion I believe) and they are done with the Frannie saga.  Plus Corker and his cronies get paid back by their TBTF big bank masters like Uncle Warren when they retire.  As the government has already been paid (or stolen if you choose to say it that way) $200 billion, forsaking $10 billion in potential profit from the commons seems like a drop in the bucket to kill Frannie off and be done with it.  What am I missing, if anything?  Does my math hold up?  Please let me know.  I hope I'm wrong as I hold commons in both Fannie and Freddie but I'm not feeling too comfortable right now.  At this point with Corker set to not seek re-election later this year, its possible the best thing that could happen for common shareholders is that nothing gets done in 2018 and hope that some new incoming congressional leaders are more friendly to us.  What say all of you?",

This one seems way more fair: https://bloom.bg/2qwNOgF,
"“The original takeover wasn’t the ‘bailout’ it purported to be; it was a stick-up,” Hindes says.He notes that while both companies had been incurring losses due to the housing downturn, they still had the highest capital ratios in their histories, were flush with cash, and had successfully tapped the public securities markets just three days earlier. The debt was unsecured, and the offering was oversubscribed.Shortly after taking control and ousting their CEOs, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA ordered the companies to book several non-cash accounting charges, ultimately resulting in the U.S. Treasury purchasing $187 billion of preferred shares (bearing a 10 percent dividend rate) so they could maintain a positive net worth.AIG and the banks which received federal assistance under the Troubled Asset Relief Program would be charged half that much.By the summer of 2012, however, the housing market had turned around, the accounting entries had to be reversed, and Fannie and Freddie suddenly became massively profitable.“It was a mafia-type ‘loan’ from the beginning,” Hindes says. “What responsible board of directors – or in this case, a ‘conservator’, no less – would borrow $187 billion and agree that no matter how much money they repay the lender, not a dime can be applied towards principal? I mean, who does that? And here’s a reality check for you: who borrows that kind of money and pays it all back in just four years? Answer: someone who never needed it in the first place. It was ‘cookie jar accounting’.”",
"I think the current administration knows what they need to do. They”will not” own this mess, period. I believe they are waiting to see if they can repeal Obama care before they make any further decisions about the GSE’s. Obama care is a huge political divide that is being funded to a certain degree with these quarterly payments. It will implode on its own like Trump says.  However he knows he has the golden keys with this GSE saga to kill it himself. He does not want to do that unless he has to. No way he lets former government officials take private property without fair compensation, screw the shareholders, then turn around and tell the tax payers we have something of value, but we are going to screw you too though. This would totally derail  the economy and turn Trumps “Pro Growth” agenda upside down.  Rule of law will prevail or our whole financial system is tainted and we should sell every stock we own because it’s the end of America as we know it. Either this administration will handle it, Swinney will rule in favor of shareholders or lastly SCOTUS will. I personally hope theIr will be an independent Investigation of some of the current and previous DOJ officials. You are seeing a wall street roller coaster at its finest right now with all the news being thrown around to lower the price intentionally and scare weak hands, which are primarily traders at this point. Many thanks to Glen and this whole community for keeping thoughts flowing.",
"With 100k shares and holding strong I agree...but recognizing with morons like Corker and Warner, it could go to zero.",
"Ultimately this will boil down to how greedy government is and who is willing to steal from the people.The government is smart enough to know what they've done and laughing at toying with share holders.  What is the value of a business that creates $20B a year in after tax profits?  What entity, or group of entities has the ability to pay at fair value the price you'd have to pay to honestly afford to ""buy"" the operating assets of FandF?At some point a settlement has to occur that relieves the government of the lawsuits.  Once the government takes overt action to give the entities away, this taking will have to judged against fair value.  Then, everything comes into play and all of their actions become discoverable.  Again, not what they want to occur, its not pretty, only time and people dying of old age protects them.  A money grab of the warrants will tank any possibility of the commons and be a ""taking"".  The best way to recap the companies is to cancel the warrants, consider the money paid back as in full.  And allow the value of the stock to float to fair value.  Then convert all the preferred to common (at this fair value - letting the market decide what the price)  and finally, issue new common shares at this offer price to raise some additional capital.  By far, the best thing is to lay out this type plan, then let the market set the respective value for common shares.  The last thing will be for the government to use some of the $$ taken from the entities and do a settlement (while in conservatorship) for all investors common and preferred.  This would be something like x dollars per share / by years of conservatorship and time held.   Doing this would force a settlement on the shareholders, and the larger holders would pre-cut the deal and ""agree"" if they knew what was good for them.....  Then, once the entities were public again congress could cut them up and do so allowing the market forces to work.  Othewise, you've got more lawsuits and more questions of self-dealing. Only a transparent above board solution, get the government out of their own mess and its all, about how greedy they are.Keep in mind, all this value to shareholders would come with tax consequences to the investors (when sold) and economic stimulus associated with the $$ in the hands of the people.  Its really a win win. Is the government smart enough to do the right thing or are they to greedy?",
"I’ve held 10k shares of each since last February. If it keeps dropping I’m going to grab more. I’m not buying commons betting on amazing dividends, but that the return on investment even if it’s 10-12 a share, will still be worth it.",
Any plans or proposals that will destabilize economy and create economic uncertainty are DOA for simple reason that DJT and GOP would not want to become one term president or party.For the same reasons Obama administration never tried to liquidate FnF. Instead Obama used massive cash flow from FnF for his pet projects and keep the wall street vultures happy.,
I just realized most people are clueless about the difference between commons vs PFD and the statements about protecting tax payers vs recap. Without understanding these fundamentals issues will affect your investment in a negative way,
Receivership will never happen. The reason for the government only taking 79.9% ownership was to avoid adding $5T to the National Debt (currently $20.6T).,
"What most here don't like is the time factor. And that plays into TBTF. The gov's delaying tactics in Sweeney's Chicago courtroom aren't helping to promote reasonable legislation. Those delaying tactics are promoting the plans of radicals like the TBTF legislators, Corker-Warner. Sweeney's courtroom & justice are being played for a sucker. In the meantime, anything goes.I would not have any hopes about a GSE case before SCOTUS. That seems like the longest shot to me.So it looks like another wasted year of ""dead money"" unless something comes out of Sweeney's court, and the 11k emails, etc. For once I'd like to see a judgement against FHFA: I'd like to see the defense on the ropes for a change.",
Comons will go over $100.00 per share. Here is why. There is more money to be made by freeing F and F. More Billions with the commons than any other way. As of today they stold over  15 Million shares that equals to a profit of $$$ 1.5 Billion Dollars $$$. They can make more money by freeing the stock. I predict that the stock will eventually be free and when she is allowed to run she will run and fly to the top of the sky like a rocket to $100.00 per share.It's more profitable to go with the commons and they know that. However before they allow her to be free they will play this game. Steal shares from the lemins when they scare them into selling and then sell them back to them when they allow her to move up a little. It's a game they love to play. A game that I to know how to play and that I'm also playing. I LOADED UP TODAY!  100 per share is in our future.,

This is just totally wrong. Remember that the PPS started going down before the article came out which suggests Corker is trading on inside information which makes it even more wrong. He should be forced to sign a document with the SEC.http://bit.ly/2F6I1BWWhat is even more interesting is the Naked short report which is not showing anything. I guess after all the complaints the government feels that its best that we do not see how they illegally trade against us the common people.http://bit.ly/2qwoHL1If we have any lawyers here I suggest you talk to your firm and establish a class action lawsuit against all of this and what the government is doing to shareholders.

Start submitting to Bloomberg, WSJ, The Post, The Times, news anchors in your areas, Maria Bartiromero, MS NBC News, (please not Fox Entertainment though... they can't get anything right except to be incendiary dullards).

I don't know what's going to happen either but I'm still sticking with my thesis that because all of the proposals go no where, congress just returns F&F and allows private capital back in, similar to the moelis plan.

"Glen, Good summary and especially very well laid out about what you know and what you don't.  Not a shock really. If Corker, Warner, et al couldn't get a plan done b4 with a favorable Obama regime, then it seems unlikely they could get it done now. The only thing gnawing at me is that if Paulson, Berkowitz, et al were offered some type of Sweetheart deal/incentive to back off to get this done. Until I see the $$$$ in my account, it is the skeptic in me.Corker is a POS extremis. So is Hank Paulson, Crapo, Warner, Warren Buffet, et al.....don't underestimate these folks. If Soros were younger, he'd have a major hand playing the Insider Game on this. It is becoming painfully clear that F&F are too hot to handle in 2018, due to the 'optics' of Hedgies making out like Railroad Robber Barons during a mid-term election cycle and $$$ needed for infrastructure. We therefore have to wait it out until 2019 when Trump and Mnuchin will have a freer hand. This makes trading the securities critical, however I am petrified at losing any 'record date' status and have allowed such considerations (as well as tax) to trade as freely as I would like.So what to do? Given the options, wait it out. Wait until that asp/snake 'dog catching' Corker leaves the Senate and hopefully some other of the Gang is forced out as well. THEN we can implement something close to Moelis. Of course, what petrifies me is that F&F are on the downside of peak profitability NOW. A year from now could be a whole new ballgame, especially with the unfavorable tax treatment of housing. Better to obtain an agreement while profitability is relatively high IMHO, but I don't make the rules. Like Forrest Gump, I am a feather on the wind.

Glen - You mentioned the Perry Capital remand for breach of contract.  Where does that stand currently? Haven't heard anything lately.  Thanks.,
Here's my 2 cents (pure speculation) under the alleged Warner/Corker liquidation scenario:1) Gov't converts it's warrant into 79.99% of the newly created entities instead of the legacy common FNMA/FMCC2) Junior preferred's are converted into the newly created entities shares (at a rate of 65%-100%) of par as a means to settle the lawsuits & give comfort to new institutional investors to commit additional capital to the new entities3) Common shareholders get anything from $0 to a token amount of the newly created entities shares,
"BTW, the older the PFD the stronger it is in this process",
Corker is a self righteous piece of garbage and Warner is his puppet.  Why the GSEs aren’t being treated like the other “bailed” out private companies post-conservatorship is mind numbing. So much for the legal system in keeping rogue elements within Congress from abusing their power. Porker is blinded with rage over Hedge fund billionaires making any profits off the GSEs. Such a silly little man...always on his tiptoes trying to measure up to the smart money.  An amazing blatant abuse of power.,
"It’s about protecting tax payers. I’m sure the assets will be transferred to Ginnie Mae. For this process to go through, Junior PFD must be whole to settle lawsuits since taking away $5T and past profits without compensation to junior PFDS won’t stand in any court. These PFDs are owned by bank/pension fund/retirement fund and their rights are protected if assets are being taken away from the GSES. Also hedge funds seem to successfully lobbied crooked politicians.Ackman/Ichan are the only two major common shareholders and have no lawsuits and have no sayings in the process. Common shareholders will own the two spun off GSEs. This is where the next opportunity will come if common shareholders willing to double down. But it will take time since political optic will linger for sometime as conservatorship continues.",
Corker gets this done. He will have a consulting job with banks waiting for him.,
Personally I find the silence coming out of Treasury somewhat comforting. I guess they are waiting for all the cards to be placed on the table before committing their own plan. I’m sure they have one. Mnuchin knows more about mbs and fnma than Corker and Warner combined ever will. Corker and Warner could well end up looking foolish,

If not, why not act?",
"I don't fully understand the Corker Warner plan; however as I've stated ad nausea it has NOTHING to do with maximizing investment and EVERYTHING to do with a philosophical view of the governments role in the housing market. This looks like the far rights initial salvo, break em up and sell off their functions to the pure(er) free market banks. My understanding of the underpinnings of this philosophy is that it would eliminate the 30 year mortgage which would tank home values which in the long run would be good for consumers as they would plow substantially less money into their lifetime home ownership (and renters) expense that could be used elsewhere in the economy. I don't see a way this doesn't wreak havoc on the economy in the short to mid term which I would expect will eventually kill this idea. Mnuchin also stated he wanted buy in from both sides of the political aisle and there has been mention lately that this is expected to be a bipartisan bill. The left is not going to like relinquishing their ability to manipulate the housing market through the GSE's and this will also bring the final bill back to the middle and probably a simple re-cap and release. Commons still likely get whacked in the re-cap.",
"Both those articles seem to have ZERO reasoning behind them. absolute garbage. Solution will be: 1.) the easiest solution 2.) safest for housing mkt 3.) allow all parties to have most return on investment.these scenarios pushed by benzinga and joe light dont fit any of those objectives. If the Treasury wants most money, they will release/ recap in private mkts and exercise warrants, which is easy and safe(companies have already been reformed).The closest plan to that is MOELIS.Treasury and FHFA wouldnt allow $3B in capital to be retained just to put in receivership, and fannie just built an insane new building talking about their future: these things dont happen if they just plan on killing them.  Also anything in a plan like that would cause the law suits to go on for the next decade and have the potential of having to pay shareholder MUCH MUCH more than they would get out of receivership, which is an un-necessary risk that they will not take.I assume jr pref get par(esp anything over 5%) and they will re issue new preferred to raise cap at low interest ratesCommons- yes COULD get higher return, but i assume the treasury will be greedy and exercise warrants(its just good reasoning to keep the companies around), so with a dilution rate of the warrants and raising capital, your $10 is reasonable, i had it valued around 9-12 but either way",

Corker doesn’t know anything but what his Wells Fargo lobbyists are telling him. I wish someone would investigate corker and how He mad millions in office shorting this stock.

Why go through all the work for new charters and reinvent the wheel, when the wheel is the most efficient wheel, per employee, in the United States.I see the Corker-Warner plan possibly making it to vote, but laughed out of Congress.  This will allow Mnuchin, Trump and Co, to execute a strategical plan that will protect the 30 year mortgage, 20% of the US GDP and send little Bob on his way to retirement without his rattle.I am still clueless as to how the best Senate Leadership we can come up with wants to destroy such a simple reform and mess with the basic integrity and merit of the Unites States Housing Industry?",

This may be the reason that the P/E is low.I also do not see how ""working to expand manufacturing capacity in Europe"" does contribute to increased cash flow/profits in the near future. ... the biggest HIV market is in the ""emerging"" markets Africa and Asia.That said, I share the view that GILD has better share value growth  potential than the more established names.",
"The above comments by me were due to error in transmission ( from my old cell phone)What I meant to say was buying back shares by itself may not help. GILD already bought back more than $ 20b worth of shares over the last 2 1/2 years, during that time the P/E was close to 8 but the stock plummeted to as low as the mid 60’s. The reason of course is with a decrease in earnings from DAA franchise in Hep C nothing one can do can help reverse the trend. They wasted $ 20 b for nothing. With the KITE purchase the  market sentiment was temporary reversed. They need to radically reverse their strategy and buy something that is at least revenue neutral, preferably with robust income. It would take at least 3 years for products from KITE  to generate a acceptable income. Meanwhile someone else may come out with an allogenic CAR-T product which does not require clumsy product preparation. The GILD team may be great scientists in small molecules ( as in the case in Rx for HIV, HCV ) but they are lacking in biologic or cellular therapies. They need to tune their ears to the Street !",
"I'm back into GILD at ~$72.50, from last week.  I am attracted by the forward 10% ROI of the business as a whole (PE ~10), with almost no net debt.  So the PE is real.  Most peers have considerable debt, and still have PE's more than double that of GILD.I like the KITE acquisition, for good will on top of economic reasons.  Curing Cancer - I like to be an investor of this movement.  It's a good cause, and I think this sort of sentiment will grow, as more patients become cured of cancer via Yescarta.  A good portion of the Market is sentimental, and likes to be invested into things that ""make the world a better place"".GILD's upside remains stronger than it's downside from here, as no one seems to believe that GILD is headed for PE > 12.... and so the current price will be supported; stagnant seems to be the worst case, but with good promise for upside back to the $90's this year, IMO.",

In the short term GILD (the stock) will probably not do much, which is pretty hard to take in this strongly rising market.

"I feel that the science is very good.  I also feel that management's focus on enhancing shareholder value is non-existent and the evidence is the performance of the shares over the last 3 years.  The old adage that a Bull market lifts all boats is generally true.  In that vein, the GILD boat hasn't moved and the thing that is most deafening about Management is its Silence.  Patience is a virtue but Sentiment is THE MARKET.  Market sentiment is bullish; GILD's sentiment is neutral (at best).  Being neutral in a roaring Bull market says clearly, Imo, that there is something amiss with this organization.Why will anything change in the share price if it hasn't already changed vis a vis this strong Bull market?  The pipeline has been the same, other than Oncology, for the last few years.  Prospective successes in Oncology, HIV, HCV, HBV, NASH sound great on paper but why would any of these 'golden opportunities' change sentiment when the current Fundamentals say that, in relation to the rest of the Market, these shares are dirt cheap?   What will suddenly change to positively impact the share price.  IMO, the answer is:  Nothing due to the fact that the management and BOD could care less.  Shareholders, if we matter at all, are at the bottom rung of the ladder in terms of importance.Again, this company needs some activists to get on the Board to change the dynamic and current sentiment.  The BOD have duties to the shareholders that seems to have gotten lost in the deafening silence.",

From what I can understand here is the people out there assigning a $100 price by year end on this stock are not providing the complete picture. The P/E as mentioned by you in high and the earnings will have to grow at a good pace to keep the momentum going in the upward direction.

"Nice article!  Notes1) Gartner updated their forecast in Oct upping the growth rates http://gtnr.it/2qu2GN02) The trailing numbers would be more useful if they excluded the exited phone business which significantly impacted each analysis area.  Hard to compare future w/o vs past with.  Likely the primary reason why the 18 vs 19 growth rates differ so much.3) Your reference to significant R&D spending is inconsistent with your projected FCF projections which ultimately drive your valuation conclusion.  It appears you are concluding the R&D investment in Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, etc will have no future value which is largely inconsistent with my view.  The size of these markets as defined by analyst forecasts is quite large which is why Microsoft is investing so much.  Are you ultimately making a call on their ability to achieve any market share?4) No mention of taxes is a bit of a problem.  I view this as a headwind as their effective tax rate is likely to increase along with a tax hit in this quarter that is in the $20b range.  Nice to have the cash movement flexibility but the PE will have to increase just to maintain valuation in short term.",
I have been reading seeking alpha for the past year or so and I appreciate your analysis. You did some great work here. I bought this stock at 71 earlier last year and have no regrets. I don’t think this is expensive either in comparison to the rate of growth. I also believe your percentages of 8% and 5% for the latter years were a little too pessimistic/conservative. I believe at worst we are looking at 10-12% for the 2020. Cloud is growing and not slowing down anytime soon. I suggest everyone to buy this stock. It will soon be the #1 cloud company,
Great piece; thanks for your analysis.  I entered recently with long call options.  MSFT is a solid company...it's growth this year is the big question.  MSFT is a very safe investment from a downside risk standpoint...very little if any there.

"The loan and equity raise from november appear to me to be a sign of desperation.The loan by itself seemed a good idea when announced until they disclosed the terms and made the offering To have an up to 40% prepayment penalty when you are hoping to sell the company makes no sense. And to have to have $128m in cash to borrow another $100m makes no sense to me and the terms for the last 2 tranches don't seem realistic. Their GIA strategy may be because they have no other option, not because they choose to.BP may have no interest or not willing to pay the price Jacob thought it was worth.Would love to know if there were any discussions of sale or partnering that fell thru because the terms were only agreeable to Jacob.Hoping for, but not expecting, a rise around approval to $5 or so so i can exit.

"The company which I intended to cite was the privately held Iroko pharmaceuticals, which imploded right after CRG extended a loan. In fairness, I should note that several of CRG's loans have apparently been successful.  In addition to Omeros, which has roughly doubled, Viewray, has done well and Biodelivery Systems moderately well.  However, two of their larger commitments - $100m to Valeritas and $80m to Tandem Diabetes - have been disastrous and both companies have carried out 1-for-10 stock splits.",
"I suggest that you go to CRG's website, where they post their portfolio.  With the exception of Omeros, it's hard to find a single recipient of their loans which has succeeded.  There are numerous flops, including Ryoku (sp?), their largest single loan recipient before SGYP.  Shortly after taking a loan from CRG, they laid off 122 of their 140 or so employees (I am working from memory here, but feel free to check and correct me.) Later in 2017, a generic version of their pricey NSAIDs was approved, which seems to put the nail in their coffin.  So either they are very bad evaluators of pharma companies, or these numerous failures are their MO.  I think the latter.",
"What everyone here seems oblivious to is the fact that the company has already been sold to CRG.  The terms of that $300m loan ( really just $100m - $9.5m interest for the first year) were so onerous that they were hidden until they appeared in the 3'rd quarter 10k.  The ""R"" in CRG is for ""royalty"".  They lend money to faltering drug companies with existing products.  The aim is to call the loan, take possession of the drug, and license it out on a royalty basis.  Even if SGYP somehow dodged the bullet and managed to scrape together enough cash to qualify for the second $100m tranche, they would be on the hook for $19m interest in 2018.  This is like a restaurant owner who borrows money from the mob.  They don't want the interest; they want your restaurant.",

"Too many individuals here are making a big deal out of the upcoming PDUFA for Trulance.  In real life, prescribers don’t really care if the constipation is idiopathic or IBS-C.  Constipation is constipation: and will Rx the medication if it works. The biggest hurdle is insurance coverage, especially Medicare.  If they can secure coverage at equal tier level as Linzess then Rx numbers will improve, until then, doctors can write all they can but the medicine will not be filled.",
"The author is basing his analysis on the wrong numbers. Trulance scripts could well increase 10 fold or more in just a few quarters. Currently available drugs in this space all have undesirable side effects. (Unless you've had IBS, you have no idea how debilitating severe diarrhea can be -- the most common and severe side effect of the leading drug in this category.)  Docs and patients are eager for a good alternative, which is why scripts of Trulance are growing so quickly and, third-party payers are jumping on approving reimbursement.  Everyone in GI wants to solve this problem. Trulance is in a very unusual position. My advice: watch prescription growth over the next 3+ quarters. The early prescription growth might be signaling the beginning of a huge disruption in the category; a nice healthy cash flow will drive stock prices higher for several years to come. Don't think this can happen? Look back at SUPN four years ago. Similar situation: new drug with better side effect profile overtook existing prescriptions -- with script growth roaring ahead in less than three years. I made 600% on SUPN before it stopped marching higher in the middle of last year when I got out. SGYP looks to be on a similar path. And, FDA approval for its second indication is looking good for later this month. Great buying opportunity caused by this article and added to my position late today. GLTA.",

"Read this from yesterday:With Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:SGYP) looking at exciting new leadership along with IBS-C treatment indication approval for Trulance by the end of this month and Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNX) prospectively garnering an FDA nod by the end of April for its orphan status asset for treatment of rare tumors, BTIG analyst Tim Chiang spotlights two biotech companies worth the bullish bet. (To watch Chiang's track record, click here)Let's dive in:Synergy Approaching a New and Improved Year for 2018With Synergy cherry-picking its once Chief Commercial Officer Troy Hamilton as the new effective CEO, Chiang takes the news in bullish stride. Considering Synergy's top priority storming into the new year eyes a ramp up of chronic constipation asset Trulance (plecanatide), with fresh new leadership, the analyst is now ""expecting a better year in 2018"" for the drug maker.In reaction, the analyst maintains a Buy rating on SGYP with a price target of $7, which implies a 188% upside from current levels.Chiang writes, ""Heading into 2018, we think there are several key items to focus on including increased payor access for Trulance, with major insurers like Aetna […] moving to Tier 2 preferred status, UnitedHealthCare […] removing its new to market block, and Cigna […] removing its prior authorization requirement for Medicare Part D Plans. In addition, major PBM’s including CVS Caremark […] and Prime Therapeutics will also be adding Trulance to their formularies.""With a prospective FDA approval decision waiting in the wings on the 24th of this month for the IBS-C treatment indication, the analyst believes this could prove to be a share driver for Synergy. Keep in mind, back in October, Synergy unleashed successful pooled data at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) meeting. Plecanatide's results showcased statistically significant results reached 12 weeks in against the placebo arm, which translates to two wins: both primary and secondary endpoints.Moving forward, Chiang projects roughly $175 to $180 million of cash following Synergy's equity raise in November, which should assist the biotech company in realizing its ""Second Tranche Borrowing Milesone"" under the term loan agreement in place with CRG LP.TipRanks highlights a strong bullish camp on Wall Street betting on Synergy stock, with all 5 analysts polled in the last 3 months unanimously rating a Buy on the biotech stock. With a whopping return potential of nearly 250%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $8.60.",

"While at the time of the article posted above by C/CI I disagreed with him and found GNC overvalued versus VSI (GNC was trading at 5.8 and VSI at 3.85), now I agree with CCI that VSI is not undervalued versus GNC because they corrected the share price (GNC at 3.57 and VSI at 5.30.

If you want a stock with a very strong balance sheet(much more cash than debt) and that has a very large appreciation potential, look at TAHO. Here TAHO is listed as having an average analyst price target of Canadian $16.83=US$13.56, even though the stock is just $4.92 US. http://bit.ly/2qDZONIIf you say that TAHO looks unattractive now, consider that when diamonds are mined from the ground they don't come in a pretty Tiffany box, but look like garbage and are all covered with dirt. The negative news about TAHO is what makes the stock price low. Too many look at it emotionally(bad news in the press) but not logically(What is the stock worth in worst case scenario, in which their silver mine never reopens?

Wow...I know that the Carl Icahn's of the world generally attempt to buyout companies with strong balance sheets, but shouldn't some activist or private equity company offer to buyout a company with this much FCF?

I have a vsi and gnc with 100 yards of each other in NYC and very common in urban areas.  Slowly allow leases to unwind and more bargaining power for vsi locations.2). Substantial SG&A symmetries3).

Bears aren't having it both ways. Both are garbage businesses. But the debt creates GNC's bankruptcy risk. VSI will plod along as a mediocre biz cranking out $20M+ in free cash flows setting a $125M valuation as pretty cheap. GNC will wipe out shareholders of common stock. They have no option in the debt markets.You can be 100% correct about the business quality difference but 100% wrong about the common stock due to the X factor that will bury GNC - its MASSIVE DEBT,

So when a minister opens their mouth, we get a move; when Cu swings we get a move; when major holders change position we get a move; when we hear about infrastrucure legislation ...........Investors dream of the gradual stock appreciation well into the future based upon sustained financial performance, while traders only focus on this moments drivers and how to make a buck right now.So I ask, which investment strategy makes the most sense for an FCX play where almost everyone on this board sees the price going up.",

This stock has been a long and frustrating ride.  My initial buy was at 35 back in 2012.  I bought more at 25 when oil starting crashing.  Held because they have/had world class assets with Grasberg the crown jewel.  Almost bought more when Ichan announced a stake but held off.  Did add at 7.5 and was shocked as it continued to drop.........low was 3.5 or so.  I was too scared but did get some more at 5 on the way up and more in late 2015 at 10.  Traded it a few times and still holding 3 K shares.I think we see mid 20's again.  Sold some at 16 recently which I mistook for the top of the trading range.

"Hi Benjamin Rowles.I like $FANG too, have been well run from an equity holders perspective, a rarity among the independent shale E&P's.A couple of things about your article I have questions on.First, with regard to dividends or shareholder buybacks, I think what that the quote of CEO makes it clear just the opposite of what you propose IMHO.  Basically, they will not achieve generate free cash flow until up and running on 15-18 rigs which will be some years off.Second, with regard to your revenue build:  What net price are you using for oil in 2018?If $57.50, that would imply an average crude oil price realized of about $64.00 in 2018 which is not what I believe you intend or at all likely (certainly not what the current strip is showing).With hedges of:  Q1 2018 = 27,000@$51.33, Q2 2018 = 28,000 @ $51.08, Q3 2018 = 23,000 @ $50.51, Q4 2018 = 23,000 @ $50.48 much of the existing production is hedged in the very low $50's.Let us use $51.  If we use your 50% hedged in 2018, that would mean in order to achieve $57.50, prices would need to average $64 for the year (0.5 x $51 + 0.5 x $64).Actually, if we assume a $2 differential to WTI, that would mean WTI would have to average $66 in 2018 for the model to be correct.What do you think?  Am I missing something?Peace,FRR",

"Thank god someone actually did analysis on SA. I agree this is a fantastic company, but I would caution some historical performance is likely not to be as strong in the future. Diamondback is an extreme low cost operator. Their Cwc (complete well cost) is much lower than average peers, as a company gets bigger and activity level rises small local service companies and companies with just a handful of rigs are unable to keep pace with the needs of the company. This will ultimately show up in higher f&d/boe and then dd&a/boe. The lowest g&a/boe is also more likely to mean revert vs stay extremely low. As a company grows more emphasis begins to be placed on non direct operating activities such as compliance, audit, technology, investor relations, legal, etc. The loe could decrease, but the only way I see that happening is through investment, so again higher f&d/boe. For example Delaware basin has much higher operating cost than midland basin driven in large part by the lack of available water infrastructure. Oil cuts are around 25% meaning water is 75% of the production. Diamondback will need to build water infrastructure or will pay $3-$4/bbl water hauled ($14 loe/bbl net!). As Delaware becomes a larger part of Diamondback results I would expect LOE/boe to increase unless there is significant capital investment. Additionally, some component of LOE is fixed so usually long run you would expect the unit measure to increase as boed decrease on a lease.Don’t get me wrong I think Diamondback is a great company but will have a hard time keeping a lid on these extreme low unit costs.",
"Like your article. One concern, you seem to think LOE and well costs will be flat to falling. In the Permian labor is very tight. Labor costs to service companies are the number one driver of increased service costs. In a rising oil price environment, I do not think additional rigs and frac spreads will remain flat to lower cost wise. I think they will increase.

"I want to believe the bull case for AGN. Klarman has a position that he acquired following the Restasis LOE.A couple people mention the Morningstar price target of $263 in various comment posts. I can't get over $185 in my analysis. I'm going off management 2018 guidance of $15.3 B in sales.

That leaves you with operating income of $6.829.Management guides 15% as a tax rate, so you are left with $5.8 B after taxes. I divided that by 6.5% for the weighted average cost of capital and arrived at a $92 B gross value. Subtract debt and preferreds of $30 B and I arrive at $62B or $185 per share.Seriously, what am I missing? Is it just a simple multiple issue? Management's own guidance is for 2018 is non-GAAP EPS of $15.25 per share. AGN's income statement is so full of one-offs that its hard to decipher.

I have been trying to get an understanding as to how tanker companies reserve for replacement cost.

I believe tanker companies have a replacement pool and this money is not included in DCF but i really don't know how it works.  Any thoughts?,
"I believe the unit price around $22 more or less excludes LNG tanker dropdowns.  Petrobras will require 4 shuttle tankers in a couple years and KNOP is having enough trouble issuing units for shuttle tankers in this environment.  If in the next year the unit price strengthened to $27, they may use the strength to finance an LNG tanker but until then its unlikely",

"Very nice overview of the shuttle tanker market Joeri.  Thanks for pulling everything together and making it easy to follow.I don't have much to add to what others have already posted.  I'm long KNOP since late summer 2015 with a cost around $19.43 (before distributions - around $15 after distributions), and I couldn't be much happier.  I do wish they would bump the distribution up a tad, but they'll get to it eventually at the rate they are expanding recently.  Sooner or later Mr. Market will realize the amount of free cash flow being generated is significantly above their operational and shareholder needs.  When that realization sinks in the price should move up nicely.",

Excellent article and easy to understand... TY for sharing this info.  Hope many read it and get a better understanding of the shuttle tanker business... very long knop!,
i assume a shuttle tankers strategy to extract oil from project is the lower cost setup? As opposed to piping back to shore. i would think that going forward offshore oil would choose this setup given uncertain outlook on price of oil.,
"All the above being said about KNOP, I would be cautious about buying it at a price above 23 until they do the last dropdown from KNOT or raise the distribution. Costain seems to view a distribution yield of 9=>9.5% as an appropriate level to do a secondary recently. He also views the distribution yield as a cost of capital. As a limited partner in the MLP, I have issues with that, but that is what is going to happen for a while.",
"If i eyeball the fleet growth chart, we are talking between 2 to 3 additional vessels per year for the last 7 years and that is split amongst the various industry players. Not exactly a needle mover especially for TOO with its huge investments in FPSO. Also, while there might be an upcoming temporary supply/demand imbalance, i would suspect that will close quite quickly with new orders over the next year or two. Regardless, shuttles trade on long term fixed contracts (including coa) and so its not like trading spot where there could be a surprise windfall.

One question: if the supply / demand imbalances appear as you predict and pricing of shuttle tankers goes up, how will this benefit the current fleet of TOO and KNOP? Will it have any impact on the part of the fleet that is contracted under time charters or bare boat charters, often for very long periods of time, or will it only have impact on the CoA fleet, which I guess earns spot rates?",

"PS  Bill, do you ever talk to Mr Costain of KNOP.  I am a retired CFO.  Look at GLOP compared to KNOP and how they have managed the debt to equity, the dividend, and the equity raises.  I much prefer GLOP's style.  I prefer their lower debt to equity, and I prefer their gentle dividend increases.  Investing is not all business; part of it is fun.  Investors (like us) could just put our money in indexes like VTI and live fine.  If KNOP were to signal even 3 or 5 percent annual dividend increases, their stock would probably rise, and they could raise equity, as needed, much easier.  The recent raise was poorly done.  I compute that their debt to equity is ~1.6 and coverage is running at ~1.40.  I prefer slightly lower D/E and will accept slightly lower coverage with some forward-looking optimism regarding future dividends; I believe this will solve the STUCK share price conundrum.",

For growth & income portfolios KNOP is a no-brainer: ~9.5% yield and for US taxable accounts that is a qualified dividend that appears on a 1099 form.  NO K-1 complications to deal with.It is amazing that near the end of DEC 2017 you could pick it up for less than $20.  Still an excellent entry at 21.5.

The only negative is that they stubbornly refuse to raise the distribution at these market yields (whereas I think a series of small increases would cure that).  They only have four contracts coming up this decade, and it's not likely those ships are going anywhere, they all have extensive option periods. I think it should be a core holding in anyone's yield portfolio, at least for the next couple years.

"Leo:I agree with your assessment about analyst upgrades in the first quarter.  At least 60 days ago, analysts’ estimates for Ford’s E.P.S. in 2018 were under $1.60.  At that time, analysts should have been using an income tax rate in the low 30 percent because this is what Ford signaled at its 1Q17 Earnings Call.  Today, analysts still forecast Ford’s E.P.S. in 2018 to be under $1.60 as analysts have not made any adjustment for the reduced income tax rate.  As a result of the tax plan, Ford’s income tax rate should see a drop of at least 10 percentage points.  At $8.0bn of pre-tax profit, Ford’s after-tax profit would increase at least $800mn due to the reduced income tax rate, at least $100mn increase in after-tax profit per $1.0bn of pre-tax profit.  This should add at least 20 cents to analysts’ estimates for Ford’s E.P.S. in 2018.  This is what is at the heart of Ford’s recent rise in its stock price.",

I’ll continue to point out that Ford is a value stock at these levels.  The beauty of that is that it doesn’t have to grow earnings for its price to go up.  It just has to beat the ultra low expectations so many investors have of it.  Something as simple as used cars maintaining a level of residual value and successfully matching production with demand will make the price go up.  My big concern is that Ford’s price could plummet just because the economy as a whole falls into recession.  As the fed continues to hike rates I’m increasingly at a loss to understand what props up this economy.  But for all the negative articles on Ford I have yet to read anyone say that Ford is a bad investment because the economy itself is going bad.  It makes no sense.,

McG paid a company (also cronies of his) $250,000 to send a mass e-mail promoting their launcher, in order to raise $3.7 million in capital. At the same time of these mass e-mails and aggressive fundraising, an internal employee email stated: ""all bullshit and smoke and mirrors aside... the IM-5 was basically ineffective and useless.""

Starting in October their second facility in Iceland was online, almost doubling their megawatt consumption (from 2 to 3.8 MegaWatts). And their plans through March of 2018 are to magnify that number x6 (getting up to 24MW!). Also, having a strategic partnership with the current largest miner in the world, Genesis, is also a gigantic competitive advantage but that's already been covered.Some of these Tea makers, womens apparel makers, patent trolls etc. that have gone into Blockchain/Crypto are indeed a joke...

"Concerning PRELF - HIVE will be operating approximately 17,211 rigs with 6 GPUs per rig, with each GPU likely having a hashrate of 30–35 MH/s. Moreover, under the MSA, GENESIS (which has the dominant marketshare) guarantees a 93% uptime to HIVE.Secondly, Hive's revenues will really be based upon ETH issuance - and the real value for HIVE is its unique positioning and first-mover advantage as a validator of the transactions on that blockchain. Moreover, missing from missive is that the costs for the company are simple to understand...HIVE’s current and future facilities will be located Iceland and Sweden which have an abundance of cheap electricity (under the MSA, HIVE pays GENESIS $144,650/month to operate the initial facility (2,301 rigs). So, as HIVE expands, it'll incur greater costs in order to be able to run its planned 17,211 mining rigs. Therefore, the key to understanding HIVE’s costs lies in estimating the cost to operate its 17,211 mining rigs...but you knew that, right??? No, you didn't.

It is as simple as that and quite natural, I would say. Like using racing cars to drive your children around to violin lessons.When one thinks of being super smart by inventing virtual servers, maybe he should be prepared to recognize that virtual servers can create added risks. And if you - as a user - don't like those risks, then just don't have your sensitive processing jobs run on virtual servers. Period.I don't understand, frankly, why anybody who does not understand these few fundamental facts, tries to confuse us all, by delivering minute details on how these ""flaws"" funtion.

"UH, OH!  Looks like your AMD might be in trouble:http://cnb.cx/2qHXkgY",
"The Semiaccurate link is worth reading before anybody comments with ignorant tosh. Intel cut corners for a slight edge in performance using sloppy architecture design, which Linus Torvald referred to as stupid. AMD did the common sensical RIGHT thing in architectural design and therefore is not vulnerable.http://bit.ly/2qllYnq""What AMD didn’t spell out in detail is a minor difference in microarchitecture between Intel and AMD CPUs. When a CPU speculatively executes and crosses a privilege level boundary, any idiot would probably say that the CPU should see this crossing and not execute the following instructions that are out of it’s privilege level. This isn’t rocket science, just basic common sense.AMD’s microarchitecture sees this privilege level change and throws the microarchitectural equivalent of a hissy fit and doesn’t execute the code. Common sense wins out. Intel’s implementation does execute the following code across privilege levels which sounds on the surface like a bit of a face-palm implementation but it really isn’t.What saves Intel is that the speculative execution goes on but, to the best of our knowledge, is unwound when the privilege level changes a few instructions later. Since Intel CPUs in the wild don’t crash or violate privilege levels, it looks like that mechanism works properly in practice. What these new exploits do is slip a few very short instructions in that can read data from the other user or privilege level before the context change happens. If crafted correctly the instructions are unwound but the data can be stashed in a place that is persistent.Intel probably get a slight performance gain from doing this ‘sloppy’ method but AMD seems to have have done the right thing for the right reasons. That extra bounds check probably take a bit of time but in retrospect, doing the right thing was worth it. Since both are fundamental ‘correct’ behaviors for their respective microarchitectures, there is no possible fix, just code that avoids scenarios where it can be abused.For Intel this avoidance comes with a 30% performance hit on server type workloads, less on desktop workloads. For AMD the problem was avoided by design and the performance hit is zero. Doing the right thing for the right reasons even if it is marginally slower seems to have paid off in this circumstance. Mother was right, AMD listened, Intel didn’t.""",
"Also, I don't think most of the people harping about ""minimal impact"" has any technical clue about the problem.This is a CPU/memory security issue, which affects VMs most particularly as they share CPU/memory resources. Cloud and server applications are exactly the ""workload dependent"" segment that will be most heavily hit.What it means is that a lot more AMD EPYCC systems will be deployed in order to shift the Intel VMs over from and to take up the slack. This will form a long term risk diversification strategy by cloud vendors so that they will not be completely dependent on Intel hardware. Previously, it was an iron rice bowl decision by IT hardware purchasers to just buy 1 brand citing homogeneous platform and hardware compatibility concerns. No more.This issue will surely accelerate EPYCC adoption. Cloud/data center operators will now ensure that they operate VMs on both AMD and Intel. If AMD becomes a mandatory purchase as risk mitigation... this will be huge for AMD. In case you missed it... EPYC is the highest margin product for AMD.",

"EnerTuition, thanks for the write-up.I agree on the seriousness of the flaw but I have a different take on the impact.I shorted INTC on The Reg's report, but I've already covered the short at a modest profit. Intel is now in control of the public narrative. The idea that this is all a big nothingburger is becoming consensus. Most home users are not seeing any noticeable slowdown, and while server customers are not that lucky (especially those using virtualization, i.e. most of them), Intel can appease them individually without doing a massive product recall or anything drastic like that. Similarly Intel will keep selling its flawed current CPUs on the narrative that there is in fact no flaw.Is the flaw more serious than Intel lets on? Definitely. Will it have a big negative financial impact on Intel? I am doubtful.In principle this could be very positive for AMD's prospects in the server room, but consider this. Most customers that pick an Intel for their server today are already choosing the technically inferior product (as measured by the cost/performance ratio) vs. the AMD alternative because they prefer the strong brand of Intel.

"Like virtually all pieces of information today, most especially in the tech area where some of us have deep knowledge and others not at all, I (in the latter category) have found that owning AAPL, MSFT, MU, INTC for example exposes me to almost daily articles that predict the near end of the world or, at a minimum, the partial or full destruction of the above company's core business. Enough experiences in the tech area as well as in the news headlines area has taught me not to react immediately and not to form an immutable conclusion that some story is or is not accurate.  The above is included in that heuristic.  On its face, the article makes conclusions and seemingly supports them rationally.  Me, I am not selling or buying and certainly not shorting in a market that is six standard deviations away from a rational valuation standard.",

Saying that the CPU is flawed is absolutely correct. It's the text-book definition of a flaw regardless if it wasn't seen as a flaw to begin with. It's a flaw in the architectural design TODAY. So all of Intel's CPU's are flawed making this statement technically correct. Furthermore, since AMD is not affected by Meltdown this further re-enforces the fact that Intel's chips are flawed because we have a working example of a CPU architecture that is not flawed in this respect. So go ahead and shout to the world that Intel's CPU's are flawed, because it's true. To say it isn't flawed is a Trump-like statement that tries to re-invent reality by ignoring the classical definitions of words or concepts.",

"Hello,Playing online poker is an interesting background for investing in stocks. I play a lot of Texas Holdem, not for money, but I've learned a lot from it. A favorite movie, Rounders, caught my interest to begin with. I do see the connection.That said, I'm a very conservative investor, and fully committed to the investment game. It's plan A for an otherwise unfunded retirement. I don't have a plan B.Anyway, oil is a highly cyclical industry and very dependent on demand. There are periods of broad economic build outs like now, and demand for oil is high. However, when the build out is done, demand diminishes and the price tanks. We've had three major lows since 2000. For WTI, these are Dec. 2001, Dec. 2008, and Dec. 2015 roughly as well as two unsustainable highs of over $100. If we are talking about risk management, and we want to be in oil at all, it would be better to to own two or three oil majors and not bicker about one. I'm long BP and RDS.B, but mainly for the dividend. Dividends do cushion the bad times, since a dividend is always a positive return. I'm long BP and RDS.B and feel the dividends are sustainable if not actually secure. I have my finger on the enter key when Exxon was $68 last year but failed to push it. Lack of nerve I guess.",

"A major reason why I think Macy's will prosper is that they have learned to be wiser with their use of the money that does come in the door. They were smart to stop repurchasing shares when they did and concentrate on paying off high coupon bonds instead. Bed Bath and Beyond spent over $6 BILLION dollars buying back their shares and are close to if not already bankrupt and starved themselves of cash needed to run and focus on their business. Macy's does not need to spin off anything, they now have a separate division that just focuses on their real estate assets. I do not think they will anyway. They did take on board much of what Starboard said back in 2015 concerning their real estate assets, but are monetising it carefully and thoughtfully.

"An otherwise positive report from Macy´s was interpreted by WS as negative. The company put so much info in the report that most of the press only highlighted the 11 stores closures and the 5.000 layoffs, despite the closures were announced a year ago and are part of an ongoing process. The turnaround in sales, better earnings projections, the progress in online sales and the cost cuts were all lost in the press reports, what for wasted PR!",

"I agree with 1. A special 'in-store' experience and 2. Unique or hard to replicate products. This is why I believe Bluemercury has so much potential for ongoing success. I know Macy's has way too many stores in their present format long-term, however, if some more marginal stores just provide positive cash flow enabling Macy's to continue paying down their debt load until other uses are found for them be it in redevelopment or outright selling them, this would be very beneficial. Of course, the retail landscape is changing so rapidly these days that Macy's may not have the luxury of time in terms of pulling this off in their preferred timeframe . Atlantic51 your last statement IMO is spot on. Macy's will succeed long term.",
"Good analysis, although a bit optimistic in my view. M’s CFO said that if he had a magic wand, he would cut down the number of stores to around 250.  To compete with online sellers and reduce discounts, M needs to offer unique products and a special in-store experience.  There is a long way to go, but they can make it.",
"Because Bluemercury offers an experiential concept as well, and is growing rapidly. Amazon cannot duplicate this and this draws traffic in what otherwise would be a non-draw situation store wise without a Bluemercury. They now have two very competent e-commerce people in Bob Lawton a former Ebay executive hired in September 2017 and Jill Ramsey, excellent in her own right, who has enough regard for him, worked with him, now has come to Macy's from Ebay. She starts next Monday. Remember, Macy's is a venerable name in retail, naturally conservative. It takes time to change a culture, but Jeff Gennette is doing just that and in a hurry. They are trying a very large number of concepts, seeing which ones work and which do not. They are serious about continuing to strengthen their on-line operation, growing it quarter-by-quarter at double-digit rates, they are closing underperforming stores, getting 'leaner and meaner' as it were. Brookfield is an extremely well-regarded property developer and redeveloper. Done right, this will pay huge dividends down the road. Remember, Macy's already owns these assets, once developed these will pay a very steady stream of cash to the company. So what if they 'bought' the Bluemercury concept, it is succeeding because Macy's opened stores in large SMSA's with decent disposable incomes and is synergising this business with store densification in these large metropolitan areas. Women in particular want 'hands-on' experiences a bit of pampering if you will and Bluemercury offers this. Good for you lot who 'bought, sold and ran' and made your quick buck, for me this is a longer-term holding with potential for tremendous gains over a longer time frame. Short-term a lot of 'digestion' still taking place with a rapid price gain. I doubt you'll see the low of $17.41 any time soon, if ever again, however.",
"How does the author hold bluemercury up as some ""growth"" story. I think it has only 125 stores at 1500 sq foot each so it's just a rounding error for M. Also, they didn't create the concept, they bought it in 2015, so where's the value added. Grasping at straws!",

"Any shorts should do the quick math on Q4 EBITDAX so as not to get stung. Street consensus is $191 mm. Q3 EBITDAX was $181 mm. Brent pricing went up on average $9.30 per barrel from Q3 to Q4.

This leaves 80,400 barrels unhedged for the $9.30 pick up. They realize at about 90% of Brent, so let’s take $8 of realized pick up on 80,000 unhedged barrels. That’s $64 mm increase in profit from Q3 to Q4, which IF it all fell to the bottom line, you’d have a massive beat to analyst projections ($245 mm versus $191 mm).

"Thanks for ur article. Pls consider that the plant nutrient investment case is all about the supply side of the story, even  if we take the demand story for granted.

"Potash is a lot like oil:  the price was formerly controlled by a cartel (OPEC in the case of oil, the Belarusian Potash company in the case of potash: 2 large Asian companies controlling 30% of the world's supply fixed their prices).

Google ""potash cartel breakup"" or something like that and you can read all about it.  The profitability of the industry collapsed, and the dividends too.

same sort of experience.   I will bet about anything for a dividend increase in near future to around 3%.   My 16K investment in 86 pays a 16K dividend even after cut today including PSX,

"Sold 1000 COP on 12/28 after holding it for 11 years.  IRR over that entire period was 4.5%  Still got the PSX spinoff though....  Bought 800 CVS the same day. COP was OK, but in hindsight I should'a bailed several years ago.  So far CVS is working out OK.",
A number of energy experts are touting CVX as being their top pick. How do you compare this to COP?,
"I would feel much better if they weren't at an operating loss. However, now that price is approaching 2016 levels it could be the right time. One caveat: there is heavy resistance right where yesterday closed going back to 2015, and it is off about 3/8 today.Thanks for bringing COP to my attention..it is kind of the sleeper of the group but a great performer normally. I held it in the past but got out when crude prices fell.For now, I'll take a wait and see...watch and wait?",

Great article.  Glad to see you are long COP as am I.,
"A.R.Found the article very interesting but am a little bit puzzled by something. Your strongest reasoning is that COP is basically a true pure play on rising oil prices, so they should benefit far more than most. Agreed. You are long, which implies that you believe higher prices are here to stay. I’m not convinced that will hold true and actually expect quite a bit of volatility, where oil prices could easily range between $50-70.

"Well I live in Oregon and not everyone is delighted with the effects of legalization. The politicians love anything they can tax. I have no problem with people smoking weed but they are making a mess of my rural neighborhood. First, it takes a huge amount of water. The land values of anything with access to water have skyrocketed, driving out other agriculture producing things like food. There are already fights between neighbors and the County has had to enforce irrigation sharing. Second, the landscape is now dotted with ugly fenced in facilities that look like junk yards. Third, the smell in the fall is pretty awful. Forth, the neighborhood is lit up by illuminated greenhouses 24/7. I can see 4 pot operations from my house on a hill. Fifth, at harvest time the pot operations go into full security mode with untrained guards armed to the teeth. Why rob a bank? The crime in the industry comes with smuggling pot to the East Coast, which can get you prosecuted. On the positive side, the local trades are coinng money to set up these operations. But that is one time. Money is also being recycled into other businesses. You have to do something with the money because you can't open a bank account for an illegal business. My point is that one should not assume a political victory for the pot industry. That may happen but certainly not in the next 3 years. My pot neighbors have been heavy on the PR front but some are stupid and give neighbors the middle finger.

"Cannabis is very young. The contributors and analysts(none really exist) are discussing the current industry from an anecdotal and backward looking (historical)perspective drawing conclusions based upon their known information.Here are the missing pieces of this puzzle and the more important and valuable elements in this industry.MJ will be more important to the food industry than it is to the alcohol replacement industry. Infusion of THC will become a staple in the future. Currently, Cannabis is being much more aggressively converted to THC distillates industry wide. You will see whole small industries built onto the THC isolets. THC will be added to coffee ( isodiol) and infusion in candies, chocolate, tea, and etc.Beyond these issues, the industry is also spreading into Hemp. Hemp has over 5000 uses. Hemp is illegal in the US because it contains .7% THC. CBD,the active ingredient in Hemp,  is believed to be an excellent anti inflammatory agent as well a being developed to become an active source in a number of other medications.Needles to say, both THC and CBD, if found to be effective medications, will take the lid off the international and US legalities.Nevertheless, the opportunities are expansive and trying to quantify these expansions will require evaluation by industry experts which do not exist at this time in the securities business.I suggest that all investors learn as much as they can and make decisions based on their own research.",

"Clearly, the author is pumping up his own interests. Additionally, he doesn't understand the nature of the cannabis trade, its economics and consequently a cannabis investment: ""Use a loose comparison to Amazon, these companies are spending crazily on R&D, building capacity and infrastructure for the legalization."" This past weeks news of Sessions Federal marijuana prosecution direction renewal will logically - if eventually and sooner than later douse the cannabis trade enthusiasm significantly. It will also give some time for critical thinking and rational thought to enter the current frenetic trade:1. There is no loose comparison to Amazon - there is no comparison at all in discussing legal commercial marijuana producers - unless you have a marijuana retail distribution company that is developing warehousing, distribution, and robotics software - coupled with brix and mortar support and distribution centers across most developed international markets. That scale is not likely to exist any time soon. Cannabis is essentially a very limited health supplement market and or competition to tobacco and liquor as a recreational drug.2. What the author and most cannabis investors are missing is that  cannabis is moving from an illegal and high value niche/artificial market status - to (maybe or not in the US) partially legalized and taxed status. I will be most comparative to the tobacco industry model. The tobacco industry production model is a highly regulated agricultural commodity production model and its economics are well documented and understood. Legalization of cannabis production effectively shatters the non-sensitive production economies seen producing illegal marijuana and replacing them with an agricultural production economics model.3. With legalization comes regulation - and not just of sales, but of production methods, product quality, consistency standards and all the various liabilities for health and social costs that come with legalization. Like other commodity farmers marijuana producers have a new partner - local and federal regulators and their enforcement agencies.  4. If Sessions continues his historic puritanical US Federal prosecution of marijuana - it means that the current legalization trade is greatly reduced in market potential - if not completely dead in the water. Most traders don't understand that Canada has 1/10 the population of the US and if US legalization of cannabis stalls and or stops - there is 1/10 of the original projected income potential of the US/Canada cannabis markets. Prudent traders and investors should not underestimate Trump's backward and bizarre little Attorneys General - Sessions and his ability to completely cloud and or stop marijuana legalization in the US indefinitely.5. Legalized (if - in the US) cannabis is now and agricultural commodity product. By definition ag. commodity products are very production cost and consequently economy-of-scale sensitive. These two economic sensitivities generally encourage producers to become as vertically integrated as possible to minimize cost, become more competitive and to capture margins and increase profits. The current cannabis equity market is entirely a sentiment (naivete) driven trade. If you are looking for a long term investment - cannabis is little to no different, or better - than tobacco or liquor. If you are a trader - you should become more aware of the context of marijuana and understand that it will conform to existing commodity models.",
First: Excellent article!  Second: For those not familiar with US government operations : Stand by for this: The President has the discretion to fire and replace state  US attorneys.  Trump hates California as they are constantly disobedient to his immigration policies and did not vote for him and the two CA Senators don't like him either. He can easily appoint prosecutors who will come down on cannibis producers and distributors.   Trump is not someone who shys away from controversy.  He may even issue warnings to Canada this year.,

Not saying cost is unimportant, just that many pot users, both medical and recreational, are very picky about what they want to smoke or vape.

"Based on the commentary on many of the cannabis related SA discussions, it seems many investors are unaware of the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF [MJX] which launched December 26. The ETF constituents include many of the most investable names in the cannabis space including Canopy. It seems reasonable that the Market Maker for the ETF would have been busy acquiring units of the constituents and may have contributed to the rally in prices in the waning days of December. It would also seem reasonable that the ETF Market Maker would be a significant seller of constituent units to satisfy redemptions triggered by Jeff Sessions announcement yesterday. Hence, the price pressure on the Canadian constituents of the ETF. I suspect that the Canadian names will be bid back up and that the next few days may represent a brief buying opportunity for some names, particularly those trading on the CSE (Canadian Securities Exchange).",

"Aphria, Inc. (APH) is the best play on the Canadian cannabis sector...100% greenhouse grown cannabis means their cost of production is far, far below that of any competitor, including Canopy Growth. Under $1 per gram in fact. Nobody operating an artificial light grow operation can come close to that kind of production cost.

"All these multi-billion dollar market cap penny stocks with a marijuana angle but no clear path to profitability will be bankrupt or making razor thin profit margins five years from now. The key will be distribution and producing at extremely low cost in order to survive what will quickly become an industry drowning in OVER supply.  We are evaluating these marijuana companies as if they will enjoy the kind of profit margins that organized crime enjoyed when marijuana was illegal. Newsflash: this industry will disintegrate into a commodity business with razor thin margins.The safest bet among marijuana stocks is The Hydropothecary Corporation (the only Quebec based marijuana stock/company with a market cap Around $450 million). It trades as THCX.v on the venture exchange in Canada and as  HYYDF over the counter in America.In short, benefiting from a lack of home based competition and benefiting from Quebec's lowest electricity rates in the country... The Hydropothecary's path to profitability is clear. They will make Quebec their fiefdom, become the lowest cost producer and go on to dominate the market. It all comes down to production costs and distribution . To make local, national, and international distribution down the road a bit easier, The Hydropothecary corporation has invited a member of the board of directors of  a $37 Billion market cap, 12,000 store Quebec based convenience store empire onto their Board of Directors. When the day finally comes that pot can be bought at your local convenience store, they will be good to go all over the planet. Until then, the Quebec government will always favor a Quebec based company when buying anything. Quebec practices an intense economic nationalism and will succeed at propping up the best Quebec company by doing business mostly with them.",

"scorpionWhat you are saying above makes a lot of sense to me.   I also think that Discovery is somewhat unique in that it can produce content much cheaper than anyone else.  If a topic is popular, they can get writers and directors  a produce a show cheaply and get it on the air quickly and  this is very profitable.  The fads come and go and they adjust to them.  The kind of content that Netflix is producing is expensive and a much bigger bet.Because of streaming technolgy, I think the consumption of content has grown in terms of a market size.  Melinnials who would not have sat down and watched stuff on a TV set are now glued to smaller devices and big consumers of some of these shows.   I am guessing that 15 years ago, the same age group would have not been watching anything and doing something  else.DISCA also has a considerable opportunity around the world as the older shows that are worn out in the USA can be shown in many obscure nations where any type of decent contrent is a big deal.   The archives of DISCA likely have a lot of hidden value in that is yet to be used outside of the USA,....in my opinion.  Zaslev has said as much.",
"scorpionI appreciate your presenting another side of this business that the aurhor apparently overlooked with his cheerleader approach.No question about it, investing in DISCA is a big bet on Zaslav.   It's a company driven by creative firepower.  A very different creature that what might  be found in most investments.  All of these creative companies are relying on a strong person at the top who calls most of the shots.  Is is and different at Disney or Fox?It is worth noting that DISCA once traded in the 70 to 80 price range.  Do they get back there?  I sure don't know, but Malone who knows a lot about this businses seems to think so and has personally invested lot of his money.The debt is huge.  The value of content that is distributed around the world is as well.   I don't think that GAAP accounting can capture a lot of the hidden value here.   This is not a company that one buys based on traditional financial analysis techniques in my view.My own guess is that Zaslav is working on and has a lot of deals pending that might be very much in demand since this business now needs a lot of content in the age of streaming.I tend to doubt that the zero growth is on the horizon or that IBM is the path of mediocrity here.  Discovery has a vast amount of business outside of the USA that is not widely known to US investors.And having said all that, I am reading your post basically outlining a contrary case (which offers good insights) and wondering why you would bother with taking a chance on Zaslav????If you invest in DISCA, it takes a leap of faith.

Even 1% on 20 billion in debt is $200 million or 10% of operating profits. However it can be paid down rather quickly. For those wanting a dividend think of it as a 4.5% dividend every time they pay down debt. I agree that content is valuable and if traditional distribution falls off it can try to make it up on their own digital platform or digital partners. However look at IBM...while building cloud it barely offsets traditional business decline therefore while -5% may be aggressive, it is entirely possible growth is zero for many years while this shift takes place.My experience is that past performance is very much an indicator of future results, despite what the mutal fund disclaimers say, but not in the way most think. Not at the level of stock picking, but definitely at the level of single company track record and management track record.Having said all that, it's cheap enough and likely declining - if declining at all - slow enough to warrant an investment at these prices but there are real headwinds with the debt and distribution challenges.",

"Thanks for the very interesting and informative discussion and subsequent thought provoking comments. Personally, I believe the biggest surprise for 2018 will come from the revival of Libigel though it maybe under a new name. In 2011 based on 4000 patient years of data, Biosante Pharmaceuticals discovered that by restoring testosterone level to premenopausal levels the reduced risk of experiencing cardiovascular events by at least 70% in women who were at higher risk of having a cardiovascular event. This was discovered in a two part larger Safety/ Efficacy trial involving 3656 patients. This discovery was never disclosed other than in patent applications.  The larger study called for 5 years of safety data and was under an FDA SPA . The first part of the trial was set up to collect at least 1 years worth of data on the last enrolled patient and could be used to submit an NDA for treating HSDD. The second part called for post marketing surveillance for a total from the two parts of 5 years of follow on each patient. Due to a very high placebo effect,Libigel failed to show efficacy over placebo. They could not submit an NDA. Biosante continued with the large Safety efficacy study and later merged with Ani Pharmaceuticals apparently completing the first part of the larger safety/efficacy study December 2012 with over 7,300 patient years of data collected.Since Biosante and Ani Pharmaceuticals have never disclosed anything about Libigel since the merger in June 2013, one could easily think Libigel is dead and there is no interest . However on December 19, 2015 Ani Pharmaceuticals added a claim to their patent application that in addition to reducing cardiovascular events restoring T-levels also reduced the number if breast cancer events. Just like with the cardiovascular event reduction the breast cancer reduction discovery was never publicly disclosed.If you look at the patent application (see link) and look at the specifications available through the public pair portal and compare how well they support the claim that testosterone restoration reduced cardiovascular events and compare it with the lack of supportive information for the claim that it reduces breast cancer events. It becomes evident that ANi Pharmaceuticals most likely did not make the breast cancer reduction discovery.http://bit.ly/2vQrq2HSince Dr Michael Snabes started working for AbbvIe and Biosante simultaneously in early 2013 and was later hired by AbbVie as their Sr Medical Director of Men and Women's Health around April 2013, it is quite likely that AbbvIe made the Breast Cancer reduction discovery. Especially since Dr Snabes was the Study Director for all Libigel trials and is listed as one of the inventors in the a/n patent. If, as I suspect,  Dr Snabes continued the second part of the trial at Abbvie. The trial would have been completed around August 2016 with approx. 18,200 patient years of cardiovascular and breast cancer data.    If I am correct in my findings, it would appear that Biosante entered into a non-disclosure agreement which Ani Pharmaceuticals has upheld through the merger. This would account for never disclosing the discoveries. Good luck to all.",
"I want to be friends with almost everyone in this comment section. Bar tab on me guys and gals!That said, GALT extremely interesting as I loved watching market overreact down to 1.50 early December to levels at $5 now. While not statistically significant, still showed benefit in patients with esophageal varices and possibly after approval could go back and design a better study for those subset of patients.

"Like you Avisol Capital Partners, I am attracted to, as you state, “ As part of my newly-gained caution, what I look for nowadays are small companies with a revenue-generating product.” Considering that, you should look at Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI). Spectrum has six ‘boring’ niche cancer drugs on the market generating $125 - 135M in revenue per year which pays for most of their R&D expenses of  2 promising clinical drugs that will (should;)) have significant news coming out in the 1st Q. I’m most excited about poziotinib in NSCLC EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations, there is nothing on the market that can treat that particular mutation with patients progressing under 3 months. Preliminary data from 11 patients in the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center trial was reported at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in Japan in Oct 2017 showed an Objective Response Rate of 73%. Current patient population in the US is ~ 5 to 10,000. Just using a back of the envelope calculation, if the drug costs $100,000 and had 5000 pts it would take in $500M. Two things to think about in this calculation is that pts don’t really have an alternate choice in medicines and that other TKIs used in NSCLC and HER2 breast cancer cost considerable more than $100,000. Yes, the data is early but very promising and looking forward to hearing about more mature data/ possible BTD in the 1st half of the year. Spectrum has also started a much bigger phase 2 trial in October for that indication and has another Phase 2 in HER2 metastatic breast cancer.   We should also be hearing about Rolontis, a long-acting Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) that eliminates myelosuppression from chemo drugs.  It will compete with Neulasta which currently has $4B in sales in the US. It will have its own J code and is not considered a biosimilar. While management hypes it as a billion $ drug, I’ll be as happy as a clam if it grabs 5 – 10% of the market considering that a biosimilar may make it to the market next year. That by itself will double, triple current sales. Top-line data from a Phase 3 trial under a Special Protocol Assessment is expected in the 1st Q. Launch is expected in 2019. While, as I said, I am skeptical of  managements hype of it being a billion dollar drug, current top SPPI management were formerly from Amgen and are quite versed in what it takes to compete. Speaking of top management, the previous CEO, Dr. Raj, who is hated by many investors, was relieved of those duties last month. OK, nuff said. Really, you should take a look.",

This is a high unmet medical need with a large patient population. I realize that BLUE is making progress on gene Rx for this disease, but a safe and effective oral agent may make the market for BLUE quite small. With a market cap of 1.6bil, GBT is not undiscovered, but I see it as at least a double, more likely a 3-4X.",

"Very interesting article, timely and informative. My questions center on entering the Bio-tech space. If you were to begin the process of building a portfolio of Bio-tech companies for the longer term, what areas would offer the best long term potential? I tend to think that the areas of focus should center on major themes in the better understanding of the genome and the application of corrective fixes to cure or moderate disease. I can think of several areas like ZFN's and Crisper/Cas9 investments, RNAi investments, and the deployment of gene editing and/or replacement to correct some of the most devastating medical conditions afflicting humans. Is this not a good way to build a portfolio in the Bio-tech space and if not, why not? If so, which companies offer the best long-term potential? Sangamo in ZFN? Editas in Crisper/Cas9? Others? ALNY or ARWR in RNAi development?

now if their publicity team would just get off their collective ass ....     keeping shareholders better informed would not only help the folks pumping hard earned money into the stock .. it might also help the SP ... if a major asset sale is imminent .. say so ..  if nothing else it would be fun to watch the shorts squirm,

Some time ago Krol reported talking to investment bankers/ hedge funds/ whatever.   Since he knows a lot about RAD, they might be paying him for his knowlege and thus there is a conflict of interest.   Hedge funds do this all the time and research stocks by finding resource people who were inside or have extensive knowledge about a given company.)Krol could come out of the SHADOWS and post here, but I bet he doesn't.",
What is Popeye's take on this?  Has anyone heard from him? Is he OK?  He knows more about RAD than everyone else combined!,
"Who knows for sure what RAD management has learned or it if has received some ""feeler"" inquiries from certain investors and these could have been indiirect.  Whatever it was, something likely triggered a need to act and  since RAD has little to offer in shareholder value beyond some happy talk and hope, it appears that the NOL story was the best reason they could come up with.Perhaps someone with tax expertise can chirp in here, but I recall that if a buyer could preserve  NOL's  if the transaction is just about shares of RAD changing hands and the ""tax basis"" is really  the same as before.  What the IRS does not want to see is a company being bought up purely for its tax losses such as a empty shell, but this does not seem to be  the case with RAD. Perhaps this is now complicated by the sale of selected assets to WBA.  A tax expert should be able to verify it.   The RAD poison pill might be more smoke and mirrors where shareholders could possibly lose some value in certain circumstances.   Sure not clear to me.",
"vcRegardless of if other poison pills have worked for other companies or not, what matters is if the board strucutured it as irrovacable or not.   There could be justified cases where the value of assets in a company deserved protection from raiders.    A long time ago there was an obnoxious guy named Victor Pozner who terrorized companies just to get a settlement.   I don't blame companies for doing this stuff, it really depends on the circumstances. According to the RAD CFO this poison pill  is revocable at any time by the board,In effect, it is just a delaying tactic.  We don't know the reasons behind this action but chances are management is looking out for its interests here more than ours.  Why should a big investor be dicouraged from buying up more than 5% of the shares or about 5 million at current prices?   If you can come up with a good reason please tell us.",
Fred's put in a poison pill when the store deal fell apart - but that was at $9. Never cared for these type of arrangements. Better to let nature take its grisly course. Nice article though - thanks for pointing this out.,
Imo kingm2 nailed it. It's housekeeping move,
"Does anybody here really think that the management of RAD really cares if individual small investors can buy RAD shares on the cheap?   Of course they don't.  If you wanted to buy more RAD shares below $2, you could have done so for many weeks.  What did RAD  management do about it?  Nothing.  They went silent and had a lousy concall in late September.Now, all of a sudden, does RAD management really think that the price of the shares matters?This has nothing to do with an activist investor getting RAD shares at a low ball price.  It's not about the price, but what the activist is going to do with existing management and golden parachute offers when they get control.   RAD management had months to state a disappointment how the ""market"" was valuing shares but didn't even bother.  Now, all of a sudden, the rights deal is signed and shareholders had zero advance knowledge.   RAD management is protecting its interests not yours as a shareholder.Nonetheless, it does seem that the prospects for RAD shares going up seem a bit better since the management is going to present their case at an investment conference next week.  Chances are they are trying to interest some big investors and this could be a good thing, even though existing RAD management may not be running the company for long.  I see this investor conference as very bullish for RAD shareholders.You might recall not too long ago---August 9 and 10---  RAD management announced they were doing some investor roadshows and published presentation slides on the website for all investors to see in order to comply with Reg FD.  What happened in those meetings, I have no clue, but there was a ""reason"" for holding them.  It might be related to the need for the poison pill.  Plenty of unknowns here.",
Clearly they got wind of possible “low ball” hostile offers or activist investors coming their way and they wanted to cut them off at the pass. One must assume they think they can raise value perception over next 12 mths to create better floor for sale.,
"if i remember correctly one of the terms of their 300m+ settlement from Walgreens ,for not completing the entire transaction, is they can not merge with another party for a period of time . i think the poison pill, which is only 1 year in duration, was to protect that settlement",
"""fear that the business will get taken over at a price that is not justified.""I wonder what fear/not justified entails?..   $2 PPS? $3- $4?",
"I don’t like this company as the board had protected Standley for years and he has been a horrible CEO. Now with this poison pill, it gives Standley carte blanche. Standley should be taken to the back of the barn and shot as he is a useless horse. We need a new stud to run this company. RAD is worth at least 4$ but it won’t get there with Standley and the current inept board.",

Each Right will permit the shareholder in possession of it to buy one share at a “significant discount” to the current market price, but only if specific events are triggered",
Thank you Daniel. What do you think about buying more shares before January 16?,
"This poison pill is designed to stop activists, not a takeover.  If company X showed up with a $2.50 offer price, mgmt could recommend against it and the mutual funds and ETFs that own most of the stock would follow in line.  What they are avoiding is a situation like DEPO, where an activist bought 10-15% and got seats on the Board and ultimately their guy as CEO [unlike DEPO, the activists in that case wanted to force mgmt to sell the company].As such, this poison pill is really a Standley and crew employment protection plan, with the excuse of isolating the NOLs.  Personally, I would have loved to have seen an Icahn or Peltz and activist PE house get in there and kick a little tail.  Won't happen now.",

"Some people think tax reform already priced in, some including me think ""you've seen nothing yet"" but we all know it all end up in huge crash rather later then sooner this time around.Next 3 month and first report session of 2018 would be interesting to watch. I am not sure but I think a lot multinationals start bringing home money they used to hide in countries with lower corporate taxes. It might significantly impact earnings.  We are already in huge bubble. I think most important thing to watch is consumer spending.  Tax reform did a lot for corporations and almost nothing for individuals.  We are paying X2 in some places X3 times for our homes, transportation, utilities and basic food comparing to 2000. At same time middle class income increased insignificantly and in some fields even decreased comparing to 2000. Even with tax cut disposable income probably go toward repaying debt and savings rather then spending spree and it will bring next crash. Hard crash.Check your facts regarding VRX. Lowest point May 2017. $8 and some change. I picked it up at 13 after Pershing sold at 14. Now I sit back and watch. With good report  and guidance we might see 30 soon, 40 before year end.

And how about the high short interest—recently over 10%--does that make you nervous?Athena: I am aware of the debt load, but honestly I’ll be out of this trade in a few months, long before most of the debt story plays out. And regarding the short-interest—I don’t mind. In fact, sometimes a good short-squeeze works out well in my favor.""VRX was trading as if the stock was headed for imminent bankruptcy - but anyone reading financials could see that actual bankruptcy, if it came was years away. It seemed very likely that, even if the company eventually went belly-up in, say, 2022, that a) there was quite a bit of upside potential and b) there was not a lot of near-term downside risk, not with the company's earnings and cash flows. Even if it went under there would be plenty of time to get out. Here we have an investor proposing the downside - debt risk - with Athena's response that there's plenty of time to get out before it becomes a problem.Whether it's a long-term hold is a completely different question and takes different calculations. And no matter why it's owned, investors need to stay on top of this one.It is interesting that this article puts it forward as a short-term investment. To me, the near-term rewards are starting to become less compelling.",

Just one question: What does these comments have to do with the article on Duke?,
"Callum,Good article about Duke. Apart from the progress in the Sunshine State it would be nice to mention that:""""""03/2016: Duke Energy has secured approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) to replace its 376MW Asheville coal-fired power plant with a new $1bn natural gas facility.""""Work under the project includes construction of two combined cycle natural gas-fuelled electric generating units, which each have a capacity of 280MW (total 560 MW)""""Approximately $750m has been planned for construction of a 650MW natural gas-fired power plant, and a solar facility at the site.More than $320m will be spent on constructing a transmission substation, a 40-mile transmission line and modernising electrical infrastructure, to eventually reduce environmental impacts and long-term costs to customers.Construction of the natural gas-fired combined-cycle power plant is planned to start this year and be completed by late-2019.""""""The above project is probably conditional on the success of Atlantic Coast Pipeline. This pipeline, supported and invested in by Duke, is facing opposition, similar to Sabal Trail which was heavily opposed before, during and even after construction.I guess, you were trying not to cause a political debate here when you only 'softly' mentioned fierce, or very enthusiastic, opposition to natural gas by writing: ""Sure, coal producers have to deal with a lot of regulatory hurdles and production taxes, but a similar story can be said about natural gas producers and gas pipeline operators. When it comes to other sources of electricity generation (excluding nuclear power plants) versus coal and the fossil fuel industry at large, regulations tend to asymmetrically hurt the fossil fuel space.""",

Thanks for the update on Duke energy.  These changes are all part of a global energy revolution that began years ago when the debate over global warming ended and the world decided to act on the fact that things had to change.,
"Yes, why be in the Accord when the US is doing their part but China and India are not?",
"The future will include more modern, efficient and less expensive forms of nuclear power generation. Such as thorium fueled molten salt reactors and eventually fusion power.Smaller standardized design nuclear power plants can be built faster and cheaper.It is government that is standing in the way of progress in nuclear power.",
"This is a great article on DUK, a stock I have invested for over 20 years.  In my opinion  the article's contents (especially future growth) also applies to other electric utilities (e.g., D).  Thank you  foor expanding my knowledge of DUK and the domestic electric utility industry.",

"Those who believe that we can in this world immediately stop the use of coal mainly do not understand or refuse to understand that it is not an immediate switch. While we in the United States   There is a market for Coal and mainly t those countries who for whatever reason subscribe to  the Paris Climate Accord get all upset because the US under the Trump Administration rejected it.  It is not because the US rejects that standard it is because the US in many cases already meet or exceed the standards set forth and many countries such as China and India are not held to the same standard and do not have to meet that standard for several years.  All the present administration wanted was the same standards applied to everyone and of course countries like China and India said they could not.  Beyond that it becomes a political mess that will not be settled during my lifetime.U.S. coal exports have jumped more than 60 percent this year due to soaring demand from Europe and Asia, according to a Reuters review of government data, allowing President Donald Trump’s administration to claim that efforts to revive the battered industry are working.The increased shipments came as the European Union and other U.S. allies heaped criticism on the Trump administration for its rejection of the Paris Climate Accord, a deal agreed by nearly 200 countries to cut carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels like coal. If for whatever reason one is dissatisfied with the progress or the steps such as  DUK and other Utility companies to reduce or is some case eliminate pollution, they can choose to not invest in those companies.Allday",
"Government intervention wasn't needed to push this change along as market forces did what they do best, allocate capital.The management's decision was influenced in large part by the generous investment tax credit in America (for both solar and wind projects) and specifically for wind, the production tax credit.So a tax credit policy is not “government intervention”? Good to know.",
"- wait, wait, wait, here comes the supporters of coal.  We will hear how renewables are unreliable.  We will hear how there is no human induced climate change.  We will hear how T administration support for coal will create jobs.  We may even hear comments about how foolish companies like Duke are acting.  We may see 'math' that coal is cost effective.  All nonsense.  The best place for coal is underground.  Nearly any alternative is better for electrical generation.  Clean coal doesn't exist.  We cannot continue to pollute.  We should not continue to borrow from the future to raise our standard of living.  Duke should be rewarded for working toward a better sustainable business plan.","Duke Energy Says Goodbye To Coal And Hello To Gas, Wind And Solar"

Anyways my point is that for anyone to travel SAS well, this business elite person, leather cache case and us poor people we had to take the train to Copenhagen, SAS was for the rich and famous. Anyways, SAS got clobbered for years and years, just could not adjust, think they had to restructure its management structure up to 23 times, still could not get in line with Norwegian, Ryan Air and other discount carriers. We still have a class system here in DK as you are aware of but over the years it took SAS many years, millions in losses and so on, but when you have class involved and this HO syndrome of - bit of the rich and famous, well it is tough to change even when competition is taking over.OK, now I will get onto my point and purpose here;",
"FT.. we should not use WTI 60 as the base now. ESV has a so diversified portfolio. North sea and middle east, shouldn't follow Brent?",
I'm a small young investor and put all my money (around 10k) into ESV a few months ago at 5.5 usd. No brainer. I'm not looking for 7-8 usd but more like 16-25usd per share. Not in hurry :),
My oil call is 109 by Dec 2018. Oil wars rage on and I see 3 major geopolitical shifts driving oil up this year. IMHO,
I'm temped to take some profits again on ESV while keeping a decent amount of shares long..,
"The bonds look like a good play here as well, especially those due in '21 and '24 IMO. Thanks for the article.",
"Long ESV, we are just in the early innings of this very long-term recovery.",
Wow oil at $40-60 per barrel...wish my boss would take a +/- 35% forecast,
When I wrote on SA and year ago that Jack up segment is already recovering you did banned me on negative Seadrill comment.  I have been bearish on Seadrill 3 years ago warning that they are in bad business model and a shape. You has been so deep water offshore believer 😂,
The caution on the stock is warranted but the reward potential is there. Once again I encourage readers to look at the bonds. I find it interesting that investors would prefer speculation over common sense investing. There is a public corporate bond market. Make a decision to find your optimal risk/reward and marry it with the optimal opportunity in the capital structure. In ESV it is in the bonds and has been for a year. With the help of the analysis from FT you can make lots of money with less risk. Buy the way the company is buying them back...do you need a bigger clue?,
Thanks for the write up FT.. Still long ESV with most of my shares.. As you know I did sell some of my OSDs just in case 477 is right.. GL Longs..,
FT - good and insightful article as usual is $5 the new floor for NE currently?  Seemed as if $4 was for a long time and is $6-$7 new floor for ESV (seemed like $5 before).  Things seem positive for OSD but real rally starts when solid contracts and day rates emerge IMO.  The floor is important to me as I like to accumulate and trade options on these names and make good money and lower cost basis doing so.  Thanks again for the contribution.  GLTA,
"I hope next week we see additional gains as short sellers rethink their position over the weekend, albeit OSD is still very volatile and may correct to the downside first...",
Long ESV. Thanks for your research.,
"FT & user: Myself (I could be wrong) but I don't see any bubble here. We should remember that these cycles can last a Long time. I remember the ""95 to '97 up cycle Quite well.

"I own Ensco but for longer term Investment I recommend you have a look at Borr Drilling (Norwegian). Former Seadrill/Frederickson employees put it up recently with 150mn own capital, bought HEAVILY discounted rigs from Hercules and RIG. Will be high quality / low cost player, therefore last man standing in the industry. Industry view: yes, I also see recovery and low replacement. Higher oil price helps (function of increased US demand and strong inventoryy reduction - check Art Berman's work) but short term overbought IMHO. Would buy more in pullbacks. Happy trading!",
"Great input as always and am always happy to see an article published by you. I am long NE and ESV also. I am down about $30,000 in NE but I did buy 8200 shares of ESV at 4.85 so I hope your right on about it. I can certainly make up that loss and more if ESV continues to run. I am in for the long term also.",
"FT,Do you not see a bubble soon forming within the OSD sector? Not because they are great companies (far from it), but because oil-addicts (of which there are many) seek a place for profit:- many oil coys are already 'fairly priced' in the current environment - some 'overly fairly priced';- many/most of the shale companies (or at least the medium and smaller ones) are killing investors - and what happens if the banks and bond holders have the absurd audacity to request their funds back and to stop refinancing?- even the obvious winners of 'quantity over profit' such as the US sand companies remain very poor investments when looking at their prior 52 week highs - SND $9 v $$21, SLCA $36 v $61 etc etc..So where to go for a speculative punt? OSDs. Already Rowan has gone from about $9 to $17, but based on what rational (apart from the fact that I don't hold it)? Ensco, NE etc may follow with significant rises, until finally someone realises that investors are actually 3 - 5 years too early and that, from a fundamental viewpoint, the sums invested are actually dead money in companies still gasping for air. And then they will collapse again.",

ill buy if it hits the $50's i dealt with this stock before and i sold out. good luck to everyone and be careful it may seem cheap because it is beaten down but i believe this stock has more to fall. the company has to flip a profit for me to even reconsider going long it is funny how my perspective on a company can change from just the summer when i thought it was a solid business model with growing revenues and cash flows. now i simply just feel like this stock is a loser and why waste my time on it when anyone can find a solid winner in this bull market. cheers and seriously good luck to all investing.,

Before there can be any acquisitions they need to save some retained earnings. From this quarter and the next and store some away to cover August and November seasonal shortfalls. So calling for a dividend increase or an acquisition seems very premature at this point. I like your spirit though.,
"I doubt it, this business is tough. Each year 10-15 percent of customers jump ship or convert to electricity or natural gas. Propane has been around along time and is a very mature industry.

"Also, you estimate current year EBITDA required of $300MM, but I am reading the annual report that lays out cash need of only $253MM, not including changes in working capital accounts. With FY’17 reported adjusted EBITDA of $243MM and record warm temps, it seems they should have no problem hitting that number and paying down the revolver. How did you come up with $300MM?Thanks!",
Surprised how SPH and it’s peers are having a such a muted reaction to the current and forecasted weather events which are driving improved heating days in the partnership’s primary markets.,

Fortress uses  NHLD as its investment banking arm. Obviously FBIO controls NHLD, fir better or worse. The question is what are they going to do with all that cash. A broker dealer might need $1 a share of this to operate so we have a redundancy of $2 a share (in a $3.98 stock) There’s no activist investor here to make them return it to shareholders so hopefully they will use it to acquire more broker dealer agents. The cherry on top of the sundae comes if Fortress Biotech has a winner which will give credibility to NHLD’s offerings.",

"With all the attention on NHLD now (at least with the smallcap community), I don't see NHLD sliding below $3/share again.   And as I keep saying... people are lifting every stone trying to find undervalued gems... as almost every stock has already gone up significantly.  With just a little communication/effort, management should be able to get NHLD properly valued.  P/E of 10 would be welcome!  And there is no reason that shouldn't be coming.",
"Great article on this bargain. I bought the common and then found warrants with a strike price of $3.25. They have 4 years til expiration and a gearing of 4 to 1. That is, for every dollar NHLD moves, NHLDW moves 4 dollars. So if the common returns to a 10 PE and is worth $10-$12, the warrants move up accordingly. I bought 17,001 wts last week. If FBIO, which owns 62% of NHLD pumps its IPO,s thru NHLD (which is why they bought it, there will be earnings. Anyway, thanks for the great article.",

"Hi Richard interesting name with all that cash on the books, but looking back I have seen that revenues, profits/losses, and cash flow have been quite lumpy/volatile over past years, but it does sound like management is interested in expanding their business strategy to try and bring in steadier/growing work.  If they can continue to grow their revenue and cash flow, share price should rise accordingly but their past history does not indicate this is a lock, so this looks like a stock to trade, not necessarily hold long term (especially as business could dry up in a recession), does that seem right? thx for shining light on hidden corners of the stock market",
Richard I agree you bring interesting items to the table. My question is could you expand more on the warrants. Since the stock does not pay any dividend your not missing any return. Would the warrants bring a higher rate of return? Maybe more leverage?,
"Concur... on the quality of the writing/research!  I'd rather take my chances buying NHLD... with an apparent low floor... vs. buying something up a zillion % already like (insert any large tech stock name here).   I sense NHLD is about to make some announcements regarding their new website/logo/new areas of business, etc..  It appears they want to change the way the company is being perceived by the markets.  My opinion, anyway.  Obviously, it will take more than a new website to make the leap from being smallcap financial company to a more recognizable name in the market.  Would like to see them start winning business with some larger companies.  And, yes, bring on the dividend!",

"Morgan Stanley contributed to Square drop and ROKU's drop. But trade continues to push Square upward.""Square stock falls after Morgan Stanley cites 'balanced' risk/reward10:11 AM ET 12/19/17 | MarketWatch""Square stock falls after Morgan Stanley cites 'balanced' risk/reward Shares of Square Inc. (SQ) fell 0.8% in Tuesday morning trading after analysts at Morgan Stanley reiterated their equal-weight rating but raised their price target from $26 to $40. The analysts, led by James Faucette, model Square's revenue growing by 36% annually through 2020, above consensus figures. Faucette sees room for upside if Square has better-than-expected success moving upmarket, to larger sellers, but he notes that there are also a number of potential downsides. These include the possibility of volatility in the credit markets, which could hurt Square Capital, the company's lending business, as well as the potential for larger players to adopt more competitive pricing, which could limit further share gains for Square. ""A narrowing gap between the base case and bull case limits further upside and keeps risk/reward balanced,"" he wrote. Shares have gained 175% so far this year, compared with a 20% rise for the S&P 500 Index. ""-Emily Bary, Dow Jones Newswires",

I was recently talking to a restaurant owner in New Orleans who is a test sight for the new Square Register ( a beautiful system by the way). He was ecstatic about Square. He said that his bank wouldn't even give him $50K but he was able to get $300K from Square to help expand his business.I see three big advantages that Square offers to businesses at the moment, 1. Access to cash through Square Capital, 2.The ability for businesses to get paid right away and be mobile, and 3. The integrated services of the back office functions, i.e., payroll, invoices, reporting, etc.I'm long on Square. My wife has a small jewelry business and has been using Square for about five years.

"Everyone has the right to have his-her own opinion. However, claiming that SQ (Founded in 2008-2009? and IPO in 2015) is still a start-up with a “business model that still needs to be proven…” seems to be a gratuitous comment, since this comment could be applied to any small or large companies in the current global and changing economy. Moreover, it seems to say that the VC investors and Analysts who recently still recommend SQ look naive or simply cannot assess SQ’s business model !",

"Regarding the author's complaint that the Model 3 production didn't ramp as quickly in the first 2 quarters as the Model S & X. That's the difference between hand-built assembly lines vs automated lines. It should be obvious hand-built will ramp faster in the early stages but then quickly get eclipsed by an automated process, once that process is fully engaged.",
"One thing that hasn't been mentioned is that the fervor of current Tesla owners for the Model 3 is actually hindering the development of a wider customer base for the Model 3.  In the pro-Tesla forums one notices how many current Tesla owners proclaim they have reserved 1, 2, and even 3 Model 3s.  If a large part of the Model 3 reservations are from current Tesla owners, it does not bode well for a continued support for a large demand for the Model 3.  After all, there has to be a limit on how many Tesla cars even the most fervent supporter can buy, just from a physical space standpoint.  If a prospective new buyer tries to order a Model 3 and is presented with a 1, 2 and even 3 year waiting period, there is a good chance he/she may look for an alternate offering, of which there will be many soon in those time periods.",

"I think the premise of this article is not correct.  The premise is that Tesla really, really wants to blow the doors off production, but they keep shooting themselves in the foot.It is true that they keep shooting themselves in the foot, but it is not true they want to achieve the production levels they continuously boast about.  There is no market for that volume, especially after the $7500 vaporizes.  The game here is to make it look like they are just about to blow the roof off production without ever doing so.It is really no different from what they did with the S and X.  Tesla boosters generally maintained there was no practical limit to demand, only limits to production.  But we know that the demand got flat almost 2 years ago and they are having to lose boatloads of money (by discounting) just to keep deliveries flat.The problem is much more severe in the case of the Model 3 because, although nobody was happy about those huge S/X losses, the expectation was always that the real action happened with the Model 3.  Well, they now can see that there will be no profits from the Model 3, and it will prove extraordinarily difficult to sustain sales of 200,000 a year, let alone 500,000.Delaying the ramp is not as unwelcome as you might think.  It buys time, and that is the one thing the company needs more than anything else.  In other words, they would rather make excuses about production failures than actually have a real 300,000 unit production capability that loses $4 billion a year.  The company fails either way, but they delay the final implosion by delaying the ramp.",

I won't lose any sleep over it though. The SP cannot ignore the gravity of this latest bombshell for long.One point that has not been raised above is the impact on the credit rating. Since the conditions for the existing rating were conditional upon M3 production rates and maintaining a significant balance of the current reservations, they risk a downgrade before they return to the markets for more funding unless they do so in the very near future. Until the next financials are published, it will be difficult to estimate their cash on hand, but I don't think they will take the risk and would expect another offering in the coming weeks.",

"DB, thanks for an excellent article. IMO, your bullet point on the ""big red flag"" of revenue shortfall caused by the M3 production problems is the crux of the matter: the cash burn at Tesla rages like a California wildfire but the corresponding revenue always comes up short ... way, way short ... in the case of 1550 Q4 M3 deliveries. It should be clear to even an 'accidental accountant' that Tesla's 2018 newly revised production and sales guidance will not support their capital structure beyond Q1 2018. But it may be difficult to to float new debt or equity on 2018 production numbers that will be straining to reach 200K cars. Financial restructuring is now stalking TSLA and my guess is that we see a credit downgrade real soon....",
You are jumping to many wrong conclusions. The model 3 is new and coming up slower than you expected and Elon hoped but they are moving ahead with the most popular car in history. Please take some lithium and give them a little time. We have had all the Malibu's and dodge foreign parts gas burners we can stand. When our model 3 gets here it will be the perfect time.,

"My point is I think they will want to move to bankruptcy protection sooner rather than later, while they still have a little (very little) leverage.

"@Donn Bailey - ""The rumors of Tesla making end-of-quarter, last-minute sales to Chinese resellers may not be so crazy after all. It is either that or some rental company could be stepping in at the last minute to swallow batches of units each quarter.""There has been ZERO substantiation of either of those conjectures by you.Let me offer another explanation. I know you don't believe it, but Model S & X production is constrained to approximately 25K per quarter. Since those vehicles share the final assembly line, every X they make is an S that they can't make in a quarter. Tesla creates a production plan for the quarter with a mix of S & X vehicles that they believe they can sell. A sizable portion of production is typically put into inventory cars available for off the lot. The rest is custom configurations and the lead time for those incoming orders are adjusted based on where they are in the build plan for the quarter.. It's that simple, and there's nothing under the table.",
"Thanks for another interesting article Donn.  Very short Tesla.  This sucker is going down.  Gosh, I should shut up, I'm sounding like a Tesla bull saying $400 by the end of 2017.  Little bit late,aren't they?",
Do you think Tesla will run out of cash in Q1?  I thought they would need a capital raise in Dec/Jan but maybe deposits on other vehicles delayed that day of reckoning.  The delay in ramp may have also delayed when bills come due.  I am very surprised the stock was down so little today.,
Musk said he doesn't expect to need any more money(where have I heard that before) until the model 3 reaches the 5000/week run rate. That would put it out about 6 more months which they do not have the money to survive thru.,
The truly horrible thing for shorts is Tesla still making cars.,
"@Donn Bailey - ""Investors are going to be taking a big hit when the market opens Thursday. ""Do you define down .83% as a big hit? Because that is what happened to TSLA on Thursday.",
"This shortfall in production is a BIG DEAL and investors need to pay attention.Not only will this put a lot of stress on Tesla financially, it will hurt them strategically. This time was supposed to be different. But it isn't different. It looks very much like as the projects (not the car, but car, factories, volumns) get more complex, Tesla is running short of 'management' and things are falling through the cracks.Model 3 is Tesla's key product for gaining market share and the 'high ground' in the BEV disruption of cars. If they don't get there with Model 3 before the legacy players arrive - that is establish volume and market share and convert a lot of those reservations into customers - the company's future will be significantly diminished. And with a diminished future, the value of Tesla will also be diminished. Tesla is priced as though the company will be a dominant player in the overall, world wide car market. If they miss this one, that won't happen.",

Yes it’s all about network technology but not just tower to devise but also increasing capacity from tower to central facilities that connect to long haul fiber networks for data and voice transmission.

The outperforming sectors for 2018 will be the beaten down sectors... energy, restaurants, retail, healthcare (besides healthcare you have no exposure) with tech and semi’s to continue to outperform due to obvious tailwinds and companies flush with cash investing in their businesses.My 2018 picks are BABA, Tencent, CTRP, CMG, KMI, UA, CVS, CAH, OMI, GILD, CELG, IBM, TXN, CY, SKWS, M, SKT, MPW, IRM, WHR, HD, JPM, BAC, C",

Enjoyable article Nick !Thanks for revealing your portfolio and the moves.I also probably will be trimming some BA this year.Happy New Year and Investing :)) Rose.,
"Thanks, Nick.  If you don't mind, I'll save your picks onto a spreadsheet for further review & DD.  My recently published portfolio update aligns with your thoughts concerning financial stocks in 2018.  From your article: ""I also maintained my exposure to the financials, for the most part. I still believe these names are cheap, on a relative basis, when looking at the broader markets. And, now that their capital restrictions are being reduced, the big banks are quickly turning into very shareholder friendly companies regarding their capital returns. What’s more, I expect the Fed to raise rates another 3-4 times in 2018, which should bolster the big banks’ bottom lines, allowing them to return even more capital to shareholders which should be a boon for their share prices in general""Have a happy/prosperous 2018 and thank you for all you do at SA!",

"@michael Do you still have the same investment thesis now that SCG is down to $42.5 today with D at $75.80? While SCG provides quite a bit a premium opportunity, D could be the better value whether the deal goes through or fails. Thoughts?",
Wow!  Just went to look at a previous article from this author and found that you can no longer go back and read articles that were previously available here for free without a pro membership.  I used to use this a lot when I was building our portfolio and researching a possible new position.When did this happen?,
"Bought D today. Continuing to dig for  ""why the SCG failed nuclear plants""  ? Reading that ""the legislators made this mess"". Can anyone share accurate information please.",
Another way to look at it (assuming you believe the merger goes through) is you can get shares of D for  SCG price = $45 / .669 = $67.25 for a share of D today.  D is trading at $77.  Actually getting D for $67.25 (close to the lowest it's been in 3 years) would give you a current yield of 4.6% growing by 10% a year.  Sounds pretty good to me!,
Heard the D CEO on with Jim Cramer this AM.  Was very positive on this proposed merger.  I was persuaded that D has done all the necessary homework and that this deal will be universally seen as a great move in the coming year or two.  I’m glad I added to D yesterday at $77.,
SCG will most likely continue to pay its dividend until the merger is completed.  In addition SCG shareholders are likely to receive over $50 per share or up to $55 per share in D stock once merger is completed.   Looks like SCG is still a buy with about a 90 percent chance the merger is completed.,
"The failed nuc plant is ~ 70% complete overall (engineering ~ 100% completed, modules ~ 100% procured, 36% of construction completed) --- this may be the gem in the deal longer term.",
Who gets the bill for the defunct nuclear reactor???????,
"I own both D and DM, am thinking of adding.  Should I add to D or buy discounted SCG shares?  Or should I add to DM on the basis that it likely has more near-term upside potential and is free of any risks associated with the proposed merger?",
I agree with the author and have put my money where my mouth is this morning by adding to my already ample D holdings.  I can't see a downside to this merger and think that in a couple of years we will view D at $77 as a screaming BUY.,
"If SCANA dips back down below 44, I am in for more SCANA. The SC legislators will be bloodied by the whole affair no matter what, but if they fail to approve a decent deal that preserves people's jobs and offers most SCEG customers a significant one time rebate, they are going to need to have an even better deal in hand. There will be some negotiating and gamesmanship over the coming months, but screwing up this deal without something better in hand would be political suicide.",
Thank you for this article on D and SCG.  I have an investment in D (fairly large) and SCG (more modest).  I don't plan to do anything with either stock (just hold and see what happens),
Nice recap. Thanks for your efforts.,
I own both D and SCG. Look forward to the future with these two stocks.,
I just hope Dominion didn't pay good money for a damn anchor.,
Isnt SCANA the buy for the merger premium?,
What about the risks/liabilities from all the inevitable lawsuits???,"Buy Dominion Energy, Hold On To SCANA"
"My concern is the high valuation of the stock market in U.S. but also in Europe. The bull market lasts already for 94 months, which is almost a record. In a bear market, you can lose as much as 50% of the stock market value. Gold often goes up when stocks go down. So are resource stocks and in particular gold miners a good “hedge” against a bear market? I think they are but I do not have good data supporting this.",

@Peter A. Any thoughts why Sun Valley resumed selling Victoria Gold  shares? Regards.,
"Peter:I hope that VITFF does not sell out, because I believe they have more potential to develop all the additional gold on their property that will make it worth more in the future.Why take 80 cents to $1 now, when they can get over $2 by waiting a few years",
"Interesting analysis, thank you.I'm long VIT at ave.C$0.48 and may add when/if equity raise weakens price below C$0.41.",

I would very much like to agree on an acquisition but I dont see it happening until some type of Aeco price recovery or a substancial liquids increase - I cant believe how cheap this stock when you look at risk reward but although I plan on holding this stock for 3-5 years I think AAV should do a share buyback for a quick pop in the stock,

Does anyone have a good source for daily AECO prices (including history)? Thanks in advance,
http://bit.ly/2FosJs910% stake,
AAV is well managed but it produces mostly dry gas despite having properties with liquids potential. Management guidance is for 2018 liquids production to be +500bbls per day. I personally don't feel that's enough to move the needle. Even at $70/bbl it's only $6m in revenue over 2018. The move to sell 20% production at Dawn should help as the Dawn price has been holding up much better than AECO but that may change as the Marcellus pipelines come on line. It's extremely tough on any predominately dry gas producers as condensate prices are high and it seems many liquids producers don't seem to care what the gas price is a long as the condensate prices remain high.,
"Maybe today is bottom, I took august calls today.http://bit.ly/2Fl6lzYFibonacci 161% down level 3,54, lets see. Because lot of fixed priced over 55% and 3,30, low cost 1-1.20 I think big jump will coming.11.01 we see gas storage in usa.",
One information is missing. The low stock price of Canadian gas producers results from low AECO gas price. This results from lack of pipelines and subsequent oversupply. And this is a critical information.,
agreed - sentiment for these guys is just so ugly.AAV is best in class for a hated sector.  Eric Nuttall mentioned back in September on BNN that AAV is considering several options bc of the option of Cash they have coming in with evens today's prices.A buyback or some type of midstream opportunity seems like a good play.,
"AAV down every day on average daily trading volume  ..looking forward to 4th q report to see what their full yr plans are... liquids or no liquids, dry gas is just too plentiful in N. Am. period.  Bea",

Yes but not where Canadian Nat Gas prices are - everyone is in survival mode.However if something happens where their liquids production goes up from a new well that could certainly be a game changer.Not to mention if Canada decides to provide more infrastructure.,

"""but because of the cost overruns, gold's got to soar in value for management to ever achieve a reasonable IRR.""That seems to be the repeated bear thesis on this name, and it's a backwards looking perspective.

What matters today, at 3.44, is the returns and valuation as the equity stands now. If the company can deliver on RR at the projected production and costs, the stock is considerably discounted to comparably sized and positioned peers, and offers a lot of upside even with a static gold price.Blackwater is still years out - mgmt has stated the cash flow will be focused on debt repayments first.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the details in relation to Rainy River, but I think I saw that its projected reserves are larger, so it could be an even more massive project.  Sure, we're in a good place now with Rainy River, but because of the cost overruns, gold's got to soar in value for management to ever achieve a reasonable IRR.Why should I be confident that the free cash flow coming from Rainy River won't just be wasted in the development of Blackwater?",

Good piece on New Gold. My expectations are too that a repricing will happen once RR has shown it influence in the quarterly reports.,
"The feasibility study production level from RR has since been increased by the company. From the more recent releases I've read, the company is calling for 325,000 toz out of the mine.This will bring total production ex peak to ~ 570 oz of gold. New Afton will also deliver 90-92 mm lbs of copper (23 / qtr), and although the company reports on a byproduct basis, the effect of the copper is an extra 223,000 toz of gold at $3.15 cu and $1300 au converted. Cu is 60% hedged above $3 - $3.30 for 2018. With New Afton reported on a co-product basis, the mine has a high 700's AISC, which translates into Company total production is close to 795k toz gold of equivalent at a mid 700's AISC.This company really is the Rodney Dangerfield of the miners. It's going to be a cash flow powerhouse with over 500mm in EBITDA, and should generate 300+ mm of FCF... all coming from safe CDN located properties. Yet we're still stuck in the lower 3's at 6x EV/EBITDA, and 6x P/ FCF. Sure is a shirt- collar puller of a stock.",

"Summary of my thoughts on FB.I think Facebook (along with Twitter) has gotten the best free publicity - media promotion campaign any corporation has in the world during the last 10 years. The message all global media has been telling - when you filter out the political side of it - for about a year, has been ""FB ads are so powerful you can win elections with them"". I think there are not very many political leaders, funders and CEOs who have missed the message. That's one of the reasons which makes me optimistic about FB getting an extra share of political ad spending all over the globe in the future elections.Right now, this looks to me - everything considered - pretty much the perfect company. The price looks surprisingly cheap for a company with such growth rates. The business moat is massive and they have new projects on the way. Political risk is really the only big risk I see in the foreseeable future for this company. But, while politicians often bully companies, they are hesitant of actually taking them down. For FB's political risk, I count on politicians typically being more interested in creating an appearance of being tough on corporations, rather than actually, in fact, being tough on them.Accordingly, long FB.",

"BRK.B: With the tax cuts, I expect the Book Value per share to reach the mid $140s, so the 1.2x Book Value threshold for BRK.B buybacks to rise to about 170-180 once the 2017 year-end figures are released in late February 2018 and that Book Value and this threshold are likely to rise about 10% per year compounded on average after that. I think this keeps the short term downside risk acceptable and probably eliminates it within about 12-18 months, short of a deep market crash.As for AAPL, it's not exactly expensive in comparison to the S&P, even if it was really dirt cheap 18 months ago. I don't know what it will do this year, but it doesn't look too pricey in the long run to me.And WFC seems moderately cheap to me unless the scandals really hurt it long term.I'm long all three of these shares at the moment, and listed them in order of my position size.

"Interesting article. Though I always take important insider’s comments with a (large) “grain of salt”, I value their perspective, having been there myself in the past. I won’t be too worried about the tax cut +/-‘s and agree with ours who see this category as the end of the tail of a big dog. OEM suppliers do well if they diversify their markets and customers and keep investing in new technologies so they are positioned to implement them when the opportunity presents itself. It looks like LRCX does that. I guess I’ll stay invested for a while and, since I’m a little under water right now may add a little to my holdings. Thanks for providing some hope.",
I think the point could be made that these companies are more secular growers as cyclicality has diminished with the explosive growth of IOT and AI.,
"There are several critical points mentioned already in the comment section the most important one seems to be the question if there is a permanent higher valuation justified because the chip supplier industry is getting less cyclical because of permanent higher demand which would be a structural shift or if it's business a usual like Kirk suggests and the below market valuation just reflects the fact that a cyclical company has to be sold when it looks ""cheap"". I have a sizable position but I will only keep it as long as the SOX index and major components remain technically sound. I think LRCX currently deserves the benefit of the doubt.",
"I think that all of the semiconductor equipment manufacturers have been valued lower than semiconductor equipment manufacturers ""forever"" since they had been the tail wagged by the dog, experiencing deeper and higher swings (more cyclical) in demand than their end customers, semi producers.  That is all changing before our eyes.  As semiconductors now permeate many new end markets (cell phones, AI devices, Self driving car technology, more advanced robotics, etc., etc.), the prior cyclical nature of the computer market has already faded.  In some sense, we have begun to see the number of dogs multiply (end markets/uses) and therefore some of the end users will become more cyclical than the semiconductor equipment manufactures as there will be steady and significant demand for their equipment due to the myriad of new applications for semiconductors.  As the market realizes the semi companies are no longer cyclical, their p/e's will expand.  And, Lam Research, in my opinion, is the premier semi equipment manufacturer.",
"I've owned Lam personally nearly 20 years and it was one of the five stocks I started my Newsletter Explore Portfolio with shortly after in October 1998.   I trade the ups and down around a core position and it is by far my most profitable investment when you add in all the trading gains.With that said, it is hard to value at market tops since everyone comes out of the woodwork to write about and recommend it as it attracts eyeballs when making new highs.I agree it MAY continue on for years if there is no recession but one of my leading indicators of a recession is Lam's price falling while ""fundamentals"" for it look great.  You didn't mention that the ability to expense capital equipment investments in US could be a huge positive factor, especially if some large US companies decide they don't want their product lines to rely on chips made in China, Taiwan or Korea.  Apple has already made the move to help Finisar build a plant in the US to make VCSEL arrays even as Finisar starts to outfil their third plant in China, probably to supply VCSELs to Samsung and Chinese phone makers....Out of curiosity, LCRX was up over 100% at one point last year and then had a huge correction.

Unless GE invites person like Jack Welch - even we don't know what he can do at this moment but market believes GE is doing SOMETHING, GE's bottom would stay lower and longer than expectation. Of course, I will be long between 8-15 area. If 15 broken, it can be low to break another 5. Sad forecast but it means that lots of people are disappointed at GE. Disappointment cannot get over just couple of weeks.",
"Update, Victor.Visual evidence of why GE has not bottomed.https://seekingalpha.c...",
"GE's management fooled a great many people over 16 years ,some expert investors so it appears. How were they able to do so is beyond my comprehension . One thing is certain : the element of corruption if not crime is there. Why watchdog agencies don't investigate on account that millions of people and pensions got swindled",
"Victor, refreshing to read your statement about being wrong above, good for you. As I wrote at the time, I think we're still at least 20% away from a bottom that will surely see 15s, maybe even lower. After avoiding paying any taxes for all those years, GE still failed to keep up and turns out now that we find that arcane financial engineering was at it's core and real earnings have been meager. GE has been a 16, now 17 year scam and it's unraveling before our eyes. A once great corporation is now on the verge of becoming a corpse.",
"Do you know how many times we have been told that ""the bottom is in"" on GE?  We have been told this for the last 15 years.  This article now says the bottom is in at $18.50.  Maybe, but I am reading that GE is now at 16.77.  There will be a time when the soothsayers will be right.  But, not now.  My guess is the bottom is somewhere around $12.  That would give you a 4% yield which would just barely cover the risk.  But, one more piece of bad news and who knows where the bottom may be",
"If it trades into the 15s, I will be happy to sell some puts. There is still value here, but there needs to be somebody with a brain to sort it all out. There are a couple such people working on Wall Street; I'm guessing one or two will come along.",

"GE is laying off employees, selling off divisions, and cut the divi in half. What will you get out of the various sales? Same as you got when shyster Immelt spun off of Synchrony Financial, NOTHING. Why would you expect GE's stock value to increase? This company is shrinking not growing. I see lower lows in the next 6 months at least.In my opinion GE is a lousy investment, they do not appreciate their investors nor do they work for them.  When Conagra spun off Lamb Weston we got 100 shares (at no cost outlay) for every 300 Conagra shares we owned. My cost basis for Lamb Weston is $20.38/share, it's trading at $58.28 as of yesterdays close. Thank you Conagra. Screw GE.",
future of the financial industry?,
GE hasn't grown earnings in 20 years.  Now that Victor has penned his view earnings are SURE to advance rapidly.  Thanks!,
"I would like the compliment the author for his positive read on GE.  As a retired attorney-CPA that fought many battles over the years with the government, I can tell you that GE has many negatives that are not given the same attention as the positives either in your article or by management.  GE has to dispose of many businesses and each time it dumps one it has to deal with two balance sheet assets that will hurt them:  Goodwill and Intangible Assets.  These are carried at almost $100 billion dollars on the balance sheet of GE.  I use to tell my students that Goodwill and Intangibles are assets you do not see (which is an interesting concept).  When businesses are acquired and you overpaid for them, accountants throw those numbers onto the balance sheet, most often as Goodwill.  It is not something that can be picked up or seen as I said.  I suspect that all the businesses sold over the next year or two by GE will be sold at losses and those losses will be reported and increased by the write-offs of Goodwill.  The sales will be reported and stock will be impacted each quarter.  There will be employees that will be terminated as they are in any troubled business environment and that is expensive in the termination year.Also, something I have noticed in my half a century of investing.  When something goes up and up and up in price as have real estate prices and stock market indexes, they take a correction.  It really does not matter if it is a stock or real estate or oil which went up well over $100 a barrel and all the analysts said it was going to $150-200, or if it was gold that went from $400 per ounce and climbed to around $1900 per ounce and analysts said it was going to $5,000 per ounce.  The current stock indexes around the world have gone straight up for almost a decade.  It will not keep going.  When they correct GE will not be immune.  The correction might be small 10%-20% but some corrections fall 40% or more.  Hopefully, we will have a normal correction, but happens if the unstable Middle East that has been at war for more than a decade becomes something bigger such as Iran vs. Saudi Arabia or North Korea vs. South Korea?Stocks will correct in 2018 or 2019, GE can sit at this price for the next 6-12 months as many stocks have gone sideways for a year, but when that correction hits, it will probably go lower.  Is that $17 or $15 or $10.  GE has some good divisions no doubt about that, but it has years of poor acquisitions and that is not going to be pretty as they unload 25% of the empire at discount prices.",
"Technically if you look at a 10 year chart I see no reason why it can’t retest $10 a share, especially if the overall market sees a decent size pullback.",
"GE is just exactly where  you don't want to be.  Bought some in IRA made a few bucks and got out.

"To Victor Dergunov (author) –This article has a major, major, major error in it.  You have confused “Net Income” which is post-tax…….with “Segment Profit” which is pre-tax.When you post that GE Healthcare has a “Net Income” of $3.2 Billion, this is not correct.  This data is “Segment Profit” (pre-tax).And this same error applies to all of the “Net Income” (??) data you’ve posted.The valuations that you’ve presented, e.g., GE Aviation = $125 Billion, are overstated significantly since you’ve used “Segment Profit” data.  IMO the overstatement is probably by +25%.To verify what I’ve posted above, total GE company “Segment Profit” in 2016 was $16.4 Billion (pre-tax) and its “Net Income” (same as “Net Earnings”) = $9.2 Billion (post-tax).  This is shown in the 4Q16 “Press Release” (see page 6).  Here is the link to the report -  http://bit.ly/2k4oRGOWhen the above corrections are made to the article, the calculated value for GE’s “Enterprise Value” (EV) is then about $365 Billion * 75% (due to overstated income) = $275 Billion.  This is just about where EV currently is with a stock price at $18.In summary, the article’s conclusion that “GE is undervalued by at least 30%” is just not so and completely in error.",

How many times have I seen this headline? Just change the number at the end.,
I was in GE years ago and got out as soon as I realized that Immelt was poison for the company. He certainly was no Jack Welch.I started looking at it again after he stepped down.

"I’m not sure the “kitchen sinking” is completely over for GE, though unclear if the market has taken into account the sizeable charge GE will take in the fourth quarter related to their legacy insurance businesses.  You may recall that GE halted +/- $3B in dividends from GE Capital in anticipation that the capital, and perhaps more, would be needed to shore up insurance reserves after completion of review.  I believe in the 3Q call, in a response to a question Jamie Miller said the amount would be at least $3B.  When they do figure the number out, it will be a hit to net income.  Although it was telegraphed, I’ve seen surprisingly little discussion on SA or elsewhere about it, though I would hope the broader market gets it.  However, since GE is disproportionately a retail stock seems like there is some chance of a “surprise” in the earnings announcement with resultant at least temporary price drop.",
The precipitous fall of GE price has yet to reach my basic investment in the company.  And now it seems to be moving upward again.  I even got a nice dividend out of them.  So I am enjoying your article and hope the stock goes up a few more notches.  But I kind of doubt it will do so unless one gets a bigger dividend.  So it earnings go up then the dividend should rise and the price per share will follow along.  Takes a while to recover from Jeff Immelt's lack of leadership.,
"I'm 70% sure that more revelations will be coming out on the company's condition.Flannery & Mgmnt are still assessing the damage from Immelt's tenure.I'm pretty sure more write downs , chargeoffs, and loss allocations will be made to shore up the Pension , ge capital etc.GE does have $46,000,000,000 overseas but I doubt that will be re-patriated because GE actually does not pay any Corp Taxes due to shady accounting.  LOL LOL",
"Victor- I agree with your assessment. Sectors in which GE works are almost all up - Take example of industrials (BA/UTX/HON), oil has also stabilized, healthcare technology will be positive. Transport of GE will be unknown. But at this point, $18.50 - does seem to reflect very high degree of pessimism. FCF will obviously dictate lot of things. However, given 50% reduction in Div, I think CEO has good grasp of what FCF is going to be. long GE as of today",
I hope you are right because there are a lot of GE share owners that have experienced pain lately.GE is not a stock for me. Their volatility of earnings and dividends doesn't jive with companies I like. I like companies that grow their earnings consistency and grow their dividends consistency. Boring companies that evolve slowly over time. GE likes to gamble too much to be a dividend aristocrat. I like dividend aristocrats. Cutting dividends is a no-no. GE has cut it's dividend twice in the last 10 years.,
Multiple of earnings are too optimistic. How to apply a multiple of 33 to windmills and the other component included is a question. Changing the culture amounts to putting managers in charge that have successful operating experience in the businesses they lead instead of financial managers who have little understanding of technology change or product market dynamics would be a wonderful development. Understanding of trends and the conviction and ability to allocate discretionary resources to meet these trends successfully may be the biggest missing capability in the current culture.,

Well, F is still trading in the low teens.The reality is that once a dividend champion falls from grace, it takes a long, long time to regain investor confidence, let alone make the structural changes to the business that lead to growth.  I'm not saying the GE will be a bad investment going forward.  But I would only own it for current dividend return and eventual dividend growth, not for the expectation of appreciation in share price.  With GE's debt and pension obligations, it's likely that the stock price will remain in the teens and low 20s for a long while.BTW, I'm still long F and GE, but my positions are relatively small.",

"Good article. If market is bearish, I definitely put GE and UA(A) as my big part of portfolio and put the money and wait for 2~5 years which probably come back to more than $40/Share ONLY IF GE walks away from Jack Welch's shadow. Mr. Immelt is just shadow boxer of Jack Welch. After Jack Welch, what did GE do? I could not see any innovation which GE was on top of notch. Market would be extremely good for 1Q of 2018, 2Q-3Q would be good and 4Q we will see some adjustment. There would be no North Korea risk - it is political talk but concern would be China and GE. If GE cannot present solid restructuring plan with expected higher oil price, their stock will remain under 20. As a trader and investor, you will have two choices. Put your money and wait for GE stock goes up to somewhere $30 which makes about 67% return but no idea the volatility and time line. Or watch this stock carefully and put money into several stocks such as biotech relating to cannabis or oil and cannabis related ETF. However, who knows? Market move to buy GE stocks as many of analysts say this is the time to buy GE. Personally, I know GE because had some business relationship in Asia. In short, they will take MUCH LONGER time to get back. They are not GE under Jack Welch. They lost competitiveness in inside. They WERE the KING of the market, but now sinking ship. New Chairman?

"So, what is the ""significantly higher"" end price for GE at the end of 2018?  The full fair value of $23.50?  $20?While I felt the article did a fine job presenting its evidence for GE being undervalued, I was less persuaded to think that the turnaround will necessarily happen this year.  Changing a culture takes time for even internal improvements, let alone external/financial/asset based ones.  Now, just now, management is expected to perform?  Isn't it always expected to do so?  It's possible that the Market will treat any news short of a complete screw up by GE as a success, but GE's bad reputation might require it to have lots of good, successful stories until the Market is convinced that things are actually turning around rather than just a set up for another mistake.Even assuming the underperforming units/assets sale goes well (I'll ignore the issue of why others would be in a hurry to buy GE's underperforming units at a decent price for GE), investors - especially those burned by GE - might want to see how the slimmed down company actually performs for a few years rather than buying based on a hopefully improved appearance.At the moment, GE is neither a sexy name nor in a sexy industry such that the first sign of ok-good news would necessarily result in investors rushing back into the stock, at least to my eyes, and this article didn't convince me that it's going to be 2018.

"To me it is very important that G.E. have a good month of January and get off to a good start for the year.  It doesn't have to peak on the last day of the month.  It could move up 8-10% perhaps in the first 2-3 weeks, in the event of a sharp market pullback or something unforeseen item occurring in the last part of the month (not that I am expecting anything).  But the tax loss selling is out of the way.  G.E. is scheduled to announce earnings on the 19th per Yahoo! Finance.  I would expect that analysts would be much less likely to downgrade the stock now, as they might be criticized for being late to the party.  After earnings, well that is a different matter.Another thing in G.E.'s favor is that they are the worst house in a nice neighborhood (industrials like HON, UTX, etc.).  Also, the market is acting fine with very little fear.  This should help provide a tailwind for them.I don't think that G.E. going up only about 30% would make it the recovery stock of the year.

RE: 40% of sales from Apple - Every time I see someone say that SWKS has failed to diversify away from AAPL I have to say yes AAPL still accounts for 40% of their top line.  What never gets said is that they've grown sales considerably at other handset makers but their sales to AAPL continue to rise (higher content levels in each newer model).  It's not like they haven't diversified away from AAPL but because of the growth in sales to AAPL the percentage of total has stayed the same.

"It's easy to show Bolt outselling M-3 right now because production is so limited.  There is nothing new worthy here.  Everyone knows with half a million reservation holders waiting for their M-3 that once production ramps up, it will dwarf Bolt sales.  And the silver lining around this slow ramp is that the tax credits will be available to more people than if Tesla had met EElon's projections.  That they did not is also nothing new because he has been late on everything, preferring to prioritize quality over numbers.  The comment that Tesla should fire Elon is absurd until you understand that it is being made by bears who know TSLA would drop if Tesla ever did such a foolish thing.  Elon is one of the most brilliant and visionary people on the planet.  Tesla and its investors and customers are fortunate to have him at the helm, frustrating as that is for those betting against TSLA.  Remember how the bears predicted years ago that Tesla could never go up against the huge car makers of the world and survive?  Little did they ever expect that disruptive Tesla would not just survive but turn that industry on its head.",

"Tesla's ultimate problem is that they have to make a profit selling only EV's.  They are competing with other, bigger, car companies that make their profits selling mostly big ICE's (pickups, SUV's,...) but are forced by regulation, politicians and the media to also sell EV's in order to continue selling those profitable ICE vehicles.  In order to sell those EV's which few buyers want they are willing to sell them at a loss or marginal profit.  In other words Tesla is competing against companies that are willing to sell at a loss while Tesla has to make a profit..  It's no different than many companies who compete against Amazon.com which is perfectly willing to sell at a loss or negligible profit just to grab the business.",

Has a Bolt been driven across the USA yet? http://bit.ly/2EPUQQK,
why are you bears concerned with such archaic metrics? tsla is inventing a new paradigm and changing the world and the market has chosen to value that at a premium. when will you silly bears wake up from whatever fever dream you're caught in. tesla will ramp to 10k a month by next quarter and will likely have a semi and a pickup truck not far after and you'll will all be in for a grande spanking.go tesla!,
"It seems this article is more about Tesla than GM.  But the takeaway I get is how poorly GM has done with EVs.  Considering the hype and investment GM put into being ""first"" in mass producing EVs and that they are supposed to be the masters of efficient mass production of vehicles.  They only outsold the Model 3 by 3-1.  Are you kidding me?! Tesla was still reportedly building model 3s by hand going into October.  If GM were truly being successful in the EV market, that margin should be at least 10-1.",

Anton still comparing an established production line to a new ramping up production line.No news here.And why is GM giving the public employee discounts?Poor sales?,
"Trent, you’re not very good at reading doublespeak. The thousand car per month production was based on a few good days Converted into 30 days. That’s like saying if I get a T-shot 260 yards down the middle, I’ll do that on every par 4. So maybe they produce 60 or 65 cars onto given days, that doesn’t mean that those cars were deliverable the buyers.",
"Eventually TSLA losing money on every car they sell will catch up with them. They can only rely on the hope of future profitability for so long. Also, skipping limited production testing on the Model 3 is ridiculous. They burn through capital and cook the books. This is another ENRON. Oh, you can buy a special (imaginary)  sports car with a 300 mile range and 0 to 60 in under 2 seconds. Why not claim that the special sports car can go underwater and fly to the moon, either is as likely.",
"The Model 3 is currently at a production run rate of 1,000+ units per week, or 4,000+ per month. This is already higher than the Bolt’s monthly sales of 3,227. Bolt sales may continue to increase, but Model 3 production will increase faster.",

The fact that Tesla has no moat and the gigglefactories were always a con to raise $$ shall never be revealed until bankruptcy reorganization, and maybe not even then",
"Such a misleading article. First of all Chevy had to halt production of the Bolt because of unsold inventory, so much for high demand. Secondly, five thousand model 3's a week is not unrealistic at all, the only ones making a big deal out of it are the bears, continually pointing to quarter results instead of long term projections, which actually have been remarkably on track, The headline suggests that the Model 3 isn't selling, of course lets not forget to mention that the pre-orders are  not declining, hundreds of thousands ae still waiting and will continue to wait when the only other options are cars that most would describe as fugly!",

"Just a note of clarification. The Ampera is actually the Opel/Vauxhall EU version of the 2012 Volt (which also sold under the Chevrolet brand).

What happened to that 9:1 advantage the Bolt had last month? Sounds to me as though the Model 3 is going to blow the Bolt away as soon as the end of this month and completely run away with the EV crown in February.,

Model 3 already passed the Bolt’s run rate......,
"If one truly wants to understand the mentality of the Tesla long investor, I suggest reading ""The True Believers"" by Eric Hoffer.

The Bolt / M3 is not an apples to apples comparison so has little relevance to Teslas viability as a company.  Tesla has a serious cash burn issue and growing losses which are my main concern.    Their bankers/financiers are probably meeting next week to discuss how they minimize risk.  If they aren’t they are fools.  The extension of credit by trades will also come to roost soon.  It may be 1-2 quarters before this is disclosed to the general investment populous.,

"In all fairness, Elon Musk was right, and I was wrong. He's said all along that TSLA is not a car company. I now see he is correct. He's incapable of mass producing cars that work. Noteworthy is that, despite the large backlog of orders, the company produced substantially more M3s than they sold. The implication is that they are problem plagued.I'm revising my M3 total sales estimate to 50,000 for the 2018 year. Same as the Bolt. Downside to the former, upside to the latter.",
@Anton -high five-,
Anton's headline is meant to make you think there's a bigger demand for the Bolt than the Model 3.  I think even the most ardent bears know that's not true.,
"If Bolt averaged 800/week in December and Tesla has demonstrated 1000/week Model 3 production with a huge order list, it looks we may already have a new leader in the mid-priced sedan BEV category. Model 3 deliveries per week will soon pass the Model X and S.",
"Author: ""Let's put it this way: For all of those articles that were published only as little as days or weeks ago - let alone months - professing how Tesla was going to ramp up the Model 3 to 5,000 per week, they have zero credibility.""Indeed, several of those appeared here at Seeking Alpha.",
"I don't get all the bashing. Tesla is now selling 100k units of S and X per year at an ASP of 90k$. competition is nowhere near the same scale with Jaguar I pace and Audi q-tron targeting 10k units per year WW. Bolt EV will only sell at ~30k unit per year in USA, beyond that GM can't recoup enough ZEV credits to make a profit. Ampera EV is dead on arrival in Europe with PSA group now raising its price by a full 9keur to try to turn a profit, nice way to make reservations holders happy! 2018 Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, Golf GTe, BMW i3 are more serious contenders but the market for BEV will grow faster than the offering available as diesel sales quickly fade away and cities + companies build recharging infrastructures for BEVs. Altogether, BEV sales will probably top 2m units in 2018, with Tesla accounting for >10% of that total and all you talk about is GM selling 30k unit/year with no real commitment to raise this up? seriously who cares?",
"You are 100% correct to point out that reaching 5K M3 per week anytime in 2018 is looking highly speculative. And, under those circumstances, it appears that Tesla must restructure its finances sooner rather than later... as in Q1 2018 ... or in other words any day now .... Things could get ugly for TSLA equity.",
"Do you know what it means to run 5000 vehicles per week?  It means one assembly line running 20 hours per day with 50 vehicles per hour.  So give or take, this is one vehicle per minute coming off line.  Even a mature car company today cannot hit this target everyday.  Any quality issue, part shortage, machine down time and other interruptions, 50 cars per hour is just a beautiful dream.  It will be a long way away.More importantly, other OEM can hit 5000 cars per week way ahead of Tesla.",
Amazing. Especially given how butt-ugly the Bolt is. Think how many GM would sell if it didn't look like a reject from Marvel Comics.,
Where's the SEMI and that Pickup?  Rescue?,
"The ratio may be 1:1 in January and 1:3 by the end of March.  Still there is another key difference: GM has a sustainable business model.For GM the gradual increase must be encouraging as nobody, especially not Tesla bulls, expected one single model from GM to have a sales rate at the end of the year to be one third of Tesla's.",
Of course people will talk about percentages when discussing growth because a 17% growth sounds like a much bigger number compared to saying 3092 increase YOY.  At the end of the day Tesla US sale numbers have been stagnant thus allowing the competition to catch up and steal away market shares from Tesla. Tesla owned almost 30% of the EV market in the US at the end of 2016 but I will not be surprised if that number drops to around 20% once all the numbers come in.,

A great experience using the Tesla product and ecosystem.  Soon many more will experience it as Model 3 sales will increase greatly this year.  Long TSLA.",
Based on the guidance on production which I will take as a lie anyone who registered to buy a Model 3 should be asking for their money back as they won't see it for a very long time.Put an order down with a car company that can actually make cars,

"Great comments from all. I do not usually provide commentary on these message boards as it typically results in a back and forth as to why he/she is right or wrong, but thought i would share my thoughts on the SDLP distribution deferral announcement this morning. First of all, quarterly distribution decisions do not need creditor approval, provided that there are no covenant breaches, which at this point, there are none. So we are not dealing with a distribution discussion. They are certainly not wasting weeks/months discussing a $7MM per quarter liquidity hit.It was clear from Morris during the last conference call that the next step for the company is to reconstruct its debt profile to something more by 'design' than by what was constructed out of necessity. In other words, they are working on extending the maturity date of the big wall known as TLB. The other secured lines can be handled with cash flow, amoritization paydowns and liquidity - keep in mind that the Vela line was pushed from 2025 to 2027 (most people incorrectly assume that the line matures in 2020 with Polaris and T15/16) while Polaris and T15/16 are pushed from this year to 2020. Polaris outstanding balance should be below $300MM after the 20% paydown and T15/16 should be below $100MM after the required amendment paydown. IMHO, SDLP is in the process of extending TLB and obtaining some covenant relief. This will obviously cost some of the SDLP cashpile, similar to the previous amendments granted on the 3 secured lines that were completed in August (cost $150MM). Since a large chunk of cash will likely be required to extend TLB (guessing ~250 MM), this will require consent from the 3 other secured line creditors, as this obviously reduces the SDLP liquidity cushion. During this amendment process, financials are submitted and there is likely an agreement that distributions and some incremental payouts be suspended so that financial ratios do not become dynamic. This is similar to why the distribution deferrals occurred last year, I guess.It appears from the announcement today that they are at or near the required % of TLB creditors in favor of the amendment terms, however, SDLP it doesn't appear that they have received the necessary consent from the secured line creditors. Since those secured line lenders have already approved their amendments in August without any dividend restrictions, I do not believe that the $7MM per quarter payout is much of a discussion point. I do, however, believe that the amount of cash that will be applied to TLB for the maturity date extension/amendment is the sticking point. My belief is that since the TLB creditors consented to the secured line amendments in August (without any distribution restriction), that the secured line creditors will go along with the amendment/extension to the TLB. My thinking is SDLP will cough up another $250MM for the TLB extension and covenant relief, while the .10 quarterly distribution stays in tact. Whether it SHOULD be cut or eliminated is another discussion topic and i have my thoughts on that as well.  As a side note, it will be very difficult to cut/eliminate the distribution as each quarter where the distribution doesn't hit .375, the difference accrues, similar to how preferred share dividend accrues when skipped/reduced. The accrual over the last couple years has exceeded $2 per unit, and per the charter, will need to be paid out in order for the SDRL subordinated shares to convert to common units. In addition to the arrearage having to be paid prior to conversion, SDLP will also have to make the .375 quarterly distributions in 3 of 4 consecutive quarters for the subordinated shares to convert. SDLP could have escaped this liability had they not avoided chapter 11 with their parent.Once the SDRL BK has been completed and discharged, i would assume that SDRL (or the SDRL creditors) will want to get their hands on the subordinated SDLP shares and accompanying quarterly distributions/incentive rights payments as quickly as possible. So at some point, SDLP will need to pay the piper so to speak, and start cutting into the accrued arrearage. Similar to what CHK did recently on their preferred.In mid 2017, i was correct on the previous playout of SDLP escaping the SDRL web and completing the insulation/maturity extensions with no impact to distributions.  Guess we'll see if I am correct here. If so, I am expecting the SDLP unit price to touch $5 on the TLB maturity extension announcement and continue an upward movement with any new contracts, the SDRL BK completion and positive West Leo resolution, which i believe will be resolved prior to the summer, when Tullow decides to commit another rig to its Ivory Coast/Ghana explorations. Several strong catalysts here.  One major caveat, Brent price cannot crater, which is a big ?????",
">>Eliminating the distribution would save roughly $100-120 million until the debt is due for refinancing in 2020/2021. This is not an immaterial amount.IIRC, SDLP is not paying the ""subordinated"" shares anything right now.  This is going from memory but there are 75M total units/shares, and 16M of them are the ""subordinated"" ones owned by SDRL.  Leaving roughly 60M dividend paying shares x $0.40/year total dividend equals $24M/year total dividend expenditure.  To save $100M in dividend, SDLP would have to not pay one all the way through the beginning of 2023. Yes, its ""savings"". . .just, IMO not a huge one.  If, by the time 2021 comes around things aren't quite a bit better for offshore than they are now, I think SDLP is going to have a big problem that another $75M probably wouldn't fix!In the meantime, SDLP just put out the same exact verbiage on dividend that it did last time when it suspended then de-suspended the div over the SDRL Ch 11 runup.   Maybe this time will be different, we'll find out.",

"SDLP reminds me of RIGP. I once had a lot of RIGP but it was bought out by RIG & I needed the distributions so I let it all go with the buyout. I have been away from all oils since December of 2016 but now I am truly surprised at the price of oil, even if it doesn't last. Henrik you make a compelling case. I've missed the distributions of RIGP but looks like we're being offered a second chance. I'm going to start accumulating. Commodities move up with inflation. We have seen stocks, RE and oil move up.

In two rigs with profitable contracts, West Auriga and West Vela, SDLP has 51% interest.All rig-owning subsidiaries are consolidated in the balance sheet of SDLP, so the debt is also partially atributed to non-controlling interest. To make a valuation case, it is necessary to analyze debt arrangements for all subsidiaries. Depending on how the debt is distributed between subsidiaries, whether or not it is guaranteed by SDLP in each particular case, the fair value of SDLP shares may vary very considerably.",

I suspect there is going to be a big production pinch in late 2018 through 2020, and an accompanying price spike. Shale will try to fill the gap unsuccessfully.

"Good news -Strong delivery numbers for S and X. They sold about 6000 units from inventory so that should help cash flow by at least $500M - $600M.Bad NewsModel 3 (duh!!) Also, it is possible that Q4 numbers for S and X were temporarily inflated because of rebate revocation fears in both US and Norway. This would then cause a significant decline in Q1 numbers but we won't know that till April.Discounting (if used) may also reduce gross margins so we will have to watch out for that (although the model 3 ramp can be used as an excuse to cover any decline GMs)...Overall Model 3 issues outweigh S and X good news but I think they may show better cash flow numbers than expected (although still vastly negative)",
"Tesla really missed the boat by launching the Model 3 instead of a pickup truck...With December's numbers in the books, total sales of F-series trucks for all of 2017 came in just shy of 900K at 897K....Just think how many HIGH PRICED PREMIUM pickups Tesla could have sold similarly to his Model S and X sales...versus scrambling around for crumbs off Model 3 sales...AND he would still be a nice and safe niche manufacturer with the faithful throwing money at his company",
Fistker is showing their prototype EV at CES in vegas. Solid state batteries are the next generation of EV lithium batteries. I am sure Elon is aware and so is Panasonic.

He was not seriously doubting Tesla's ability to ramp up Model 3 production by the end of  2018; he simply felt a rational analysis of Tesla doesn't support a stock price above $170.

"In the long term the vehicle residual value is what matters.If you buy a mid-size ICE truck you get 60% of what you paid for it 3 years latter.If you buy EV you get 27%, that is why most EVs (other than TESLA) are leased, BMW i3 = 92% EV are leases for example.Model 3 is however predicted to be worth less than 21% in 36 months and that is based on the MSRP, as any extra options are nearly worthless on any used vehicle, and that is the highest depreciation of any EV, even FIAT 500 is worth 23%.When as OEM you get your vehicles back in 36 months and still pocket the ZEV credits, then there is no need for the 8 year battery warranty and thus no unexpected future expenses.",

Wonder what happens when Elon goes for a capital raise and there’s no takers?  No one in their right mind would lend a company money with this toxic of a balance sheet.  Investment banks that beat the drum to try and raise money on Tesla’s behalf will face increasing scrutiny and potential liability - perhaps enormous liability.  Tesla is a dead man walking.  You have Elon to blame for his manic behavior and pie in the sky (broken) promises.  I predict time of death around 6 months from now.,
lets all agree. these numbers are just ok. nothing great nothing really bad. The problem is the stock price reflects really great.,
Musk was busy buying his own cars.  Wonder where he parked them all?,
"The real question is will M3 production eventually ramp to a reasonable number (200k/yr) and will demand support that production? S and X may need a facelift soon, can't sell the same car forever. Not much incentive for existing customers to upgrade to the same car again. At some point revenue needs to exceed spending!",

TSLA has neither Profits nor adequate Debt control.",
"""Tesla Fails Again with Model 3""...I keep imagining what their neighbors must have said to the Wright Brothers each year when they returned having ""failed"" again at Kitty Hawk.  And of course in retrospect it's more accurate to say they were making incremental progress. The Model 3 isn't quite as dramatic as First Filght and a burgeoning flight industry, but it's close.  I think it's irrelevant whether it takes 6 months or 12 months or whatever to get up and running.  The effect of people seeing these driving down the road, all across America, is going to change things forever.  And a few Bolts won't do that...neither will a few Tata-Jaguars.",
Deliveries in Transit take a dive.I guess that by now everybody in Transit is already driving a Tesla,
"Tesla has a singular product, and I chalk up its delays to growing pains as it breaks new ground in a market that is still embryonic. As others have noted, if Tesla were cranking out cars by the tens of thousands, there would probably be insufficient demand for its products. Tesla has a superior brand in the EV market, and that will be its trump card as the market slowly grows. This is a company clearly going through a manufacturing learning curve. Progress is slow but steady, and if Tesla can continue to find the cash and financing needed to carry on--million dollar question--I for one think that it could yet become a big success.",
"Da Bears Win! Da bears Win!  No - they didn't.  They, the bears, are so busy doing their victory dance that they failed to acknowledge two simple facts.   In fact, the news from Tesla was as good as I expected and bulls should be encouraged.   Fact # 1: ""and 860 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter..""This is a highly significant number - in Q4 Tesla delivered 1550 Model 3s.   860 in transit + 1550 delivered = 2410.   So Q4 production was 2410.    So 36% of the Q4 production will not be delivered until Q1.    Obviously the delivery specialists were not able to handle a huge volume of cars in the last week of the year so deliveries were scheduled for 2018.   Guess what - people travel over the holidays and going to Fremont or MDR on three days notice isn't feasible for many if they are traveling.Fact # 2: ""In the last seven working days of the quarter, we made 793 Model 3’s, and in the last few days, we hit a production rate on each of our manufacturing lines that extrapolates to over 1,000 Model 3’s per week.""Now I ask you - imagine you're on a plane - speeding down a runway, about to take off.    Do you sit and fret over the speed in the first hundred yards of the take off runway, or do you hope that the current speed is ""V2""?    Exactly.   So when you look at December for Tesla do you focus on the first half or the month or the last seven days when it comes down to production speed.   You see 793 - which is a hundred and ten a day, and then you see that the Production line was ""clocked"" at 140/day (1000/7) at the end of the month.January 2018 will see a production of 3,500 plus Model 3s and deliveries of about 3000.Now what about this negative remark:""As we continue to focus on quality and efficiency rather than simply pushing for the highest possible volume in the shortest period of time, we expect to have a slightly more gradual ramp through Q1, likely ending the quarter at a weekly rate of about 2,500 Model 3 vehicles.""Isn't this the capitulation that the bears are celebrating?   If, so they are deluding themselves.   I'm stunned by the use of the two words: ""quality"" and ""efficiency"".     This is so unTesla!   When did Tesla care about quality and efficiency - after all - it's just a Ponzi scheme, right? So what is going on?  I think the answer is that the word ""quality"" means that  some of the robotic stations on the line are doing an adequate job, but Tesla has decided to replace them with better robots that are ""on order"" - probably from Germany.    In other words, they can't run fast enough to keep up with the rest of the line.   The production line runs at the speed of the most inefficient robot.""Efficiency"" - meaning production close to plan.   The answer here as to why this word ""efficiency"" is used is that Tesla doesn't want to pay massive amounts of overtime to achieve the 5000/week goal.   Having workers in Fremont seven days a week isn't sensible given the state's labor laws.  It's very expensive.   They would rather wait for the line to become more efficient first.   (The other question is this: how long can Tesla produce only the LR version of the Model 3 and not run ahead of demand?  Producing one version has to be the most efficient for the production line.  It makes sense to delay producing the second - standard version to mid- March so you can ramp up deliveries in Q2 and enjoy the full Federal Tax Credit.)",
"Adam Jonas from MS things this is a buy the dip opportunity.While he still leaves his Equal Weight rating and price target intact.I suspect the value of bullish comments has been diminishing over the past 6-8 months exactly as the value of fantastical projections/tweets by EM has been diminishing, vis-a-vis the stock price market action.it would be interesting to see if AJ and MS can garner interest over the next few days .Below are AJ freshly posted comments:"" Tesla posted Model S, Model X and Model 3 4Q delivery numbers aboveour forecast for each model line. Model S volume increased roughly 20%YoY (MS at +7.5%). Model X volume jumped nearly 40% (MS at +29%).Model 3 volume came in at 1,550 units vs. our 1,000 forecast.Model 3 production rate exiting 4Q17 easily 50% above our pace ofdelivery forecast for 1Q. Our 1Q Model 3 delivery forecast of 8k unitsimplies a pace of less than 700 per week. Tesla reported that it produced793 Model 3s in the last 7 days of 2017 and in the last few days hit a rateof over 1k per week. Both are well ahead of the weekly delivery rateimplied in our 1Q forecast. In other words, Tesla appears to be currentlyproducing the Model 3 at a pace is well ahead of the pace implied in ourearnings model.Tesla officially pushed out its target of 5,000 Model 3 per week by a fullquarter to the end of 2Q18. This should not at all be a surprise to themarket, in our opinion. While we do not forecast exit production levels inany individual quarter for any individual model, we believe the 2,500target of weekly Model 3 production by end of 1Q is roughly 2x ourforecast. For 2Q18, we forecast 24k Model 3 deliveries for the entirequarter for an average of 2k per week. Tesla expects to exit 2Q at 5k perweek.Our current forecasts do not imply reaching 5k Model 3 production perweek at any time in 2H18… yet their revised forecast has them startingout the quarter at that pace. We forecast 32,400 (2,700 per week) and45,600 (3,800 per week) Model 3 deliveries in 3Q and 4Q respectively.We continue to view Tesla as a high risk investment. The upside to our $379price target should be seen from the perspective of elevated risk. While there isa ton of attention around the ramp of Model 3 in early 2018, we continue tobelieve the greater risk to the stock involves encroachment from tech firms withadjacent data monetization opportunities in the mobility ecosystem. We expectTesla shares to be extremely volatile in 2018, divided into two stages: (1) Thealleviation of production bottlenecks with strong cash inflow, and (2) mountingconcerns over the sustainability of the competitive moat. See our November 21,2017 report: Tesla Inc: Tesla 2018: $400 then $200?""",

"Back in August TSLA announced good numbers and gave upbeat guidance on the Model 3 production outlook.

A down move in the $45 neighborhood would not surprise me at all.

"It looks so dangerous and risky, but I'm inclined to buy a little more TAHO here.   If they get that sorted out at Escobal I see it becoming a >10% yielding investment at this price and a cash flow machine that trades at $30 pps at $30/oz silver, and $50-100 pps at $50 silver when they get there again.   The mine is long life enough that it will see $50 silver again even if it takes many years.   If Guatamala becomes a total wash, then I still think these guys survive and turn into a decent little midtier gold miner that will recover the losses and be $10-20 again when gold makes an authoritative move back to $1500-2000.   By the end of Trumps second term certainly.   LOL     I think AAU would be a smart bolt-on acquisition that would be easy to buy and build.   But I prefer AG buys them out because I love Keith Neumayer and First Majestic for their history of operational excellence and management acumen.    But Taho management is top tier too.   They are Glamis which was one of the best performing management teams during the last cycle and built a powerhouse that was aquired by Goldcorp for a pretty penny.",
"I can't help liking AAU Almaden Minerals.   Their Ixhtaca deposit looks very robust and checks off a lot of the boxes 1) long life 2) low cost - both to build and to mine 3) half silver/half gold so huge extra silver leverage as silver will not be $17 for the next 15 years 4) decent cash position for a sub $100M market cap.   It seems like it would be a great fit for First Majestic, as it would be massively accretive.   It's right in their favored jurisdiction.  They could increase total silver equivalent production by 80% or more from current levels and could easily afford to build the mine.   It would also add a long life asset and lower their overall AISC.   Just my opinion.   The stock was peppy in 2016 and first half of 2017 but has been languishing for months.   Also love Leagold.   Superb management and an overlooked junior that could turn into a midtier producer with a couple smart tuck in acquisitions.   It's a one mine company, but its a good mine they bought from Goldcorp that can produce a lot of FCF for a long time.KL and SAND look like no brainer long term buy and holds for gold investors.   I think those stocks will act a lot like Randgold did back in the last bull market.    Another common thread - smart management.   You won't find me throwing away money on the likes of Yamana and Kinross with a history of destroying long term value by idiotic M&A.   IAG looks awfully sanguine.    With $1B in cash and reducing debt quickly how could they lose?   Gold goes under $1000?   Not likely, and if it happened would be short lived like 2008 when markets crashed and then the sector came screaming out of the hole like a Phoenix.  I like Bonterra as an early drill bit play.   Massively cashed up and have several prominent cornerstone investors who have ponied up.   I see it trading in a wide range, but in 2-3 years after they prove up a high grade multimillion oz deposit could see it becoming a ten bagger that is acquired by a major.   Enough has been said about Novo, but I'm not selling.   If a few guys can go out with metal detectors and a couple jackhammers and find a million dollars worth of gold in a day, I'm fairly sure they can build a small plant and bring in some heavy equipment and scoop up those right at the surface nuggets economically.   They have enough cash to mine, and no need to go to market again.   If their land wasn't in a sparsely populated region of a first world country it would look like Serra Pelada in the early 1980s right now.   LOL",

"2018 Top Pick (in my opinion): GCM, very high grade, producing over 16 g/t, current P/E of 2, EV/EBITDA under 2, extremely undervalued relative to peers. Compare the numbers to other gold producers. Catalysts: - Record production for 2018 with increased plant capacity, new high grade Providencia mine ramped up,- Guidance for 2018 will be a jump higher than 2017.- Debt drops by $46M mid 2018 from conversion of debentures at the option of the company at a higher price than current share price.- Positive FCF buying back debt.- PEA in 2018 for Marmato, a large >8M oz mountain of gold that is not given value yet, trading at $0/oz (because people think locals object to open pit, but they have now changed strategy to underground only, to bypass locals). NPV could be several times the current company valuation. Old 2012 PEA had NPV of $$485M for underground portion of 2.8Moz. Since then they added 4Moz+ from Marmato deeps.",

and server,
"I am a Tech, And I own a Tech company that builds in installs servers on contract with Companies like Microsoft. I also own stock in both  companies. In the last two days we have signed long term contracts to start building and deploying AMD Epic servers for Microsoft. This happening all over the tech world. And with many It consulting companies all in the later 72 hours. I know that my company and many others I have talked to in the tech world that build computers, servers, and recommend to customers all the equipment are saying the same thing, We are not going to recommend Intel to anyone, Why? We are selves do not want to ruin our reputation with our customers, or take on any type of liability due to this. Why would we?To the people who are saying AMD has the flaw too you are wrong and this is why! Take it from a MCSE.AMD is not affected by INTEL Flaw and this is why!"" Quote AMD"">>To be clear, the security research team identified three variants targeting speculative execution. The threat and the response to the three variants differ by microprocessor company, and AMD is not susceptible to all three variants. Due to differences in AMD's architecture, we believe there is a near zero risk to AMD processors at this time. And they are right.AMD processors are not subject to the types of attacks that the kernel page table isolation feature protects against,” Intel does not, seems they eliminated it to get more speed out of their chips.The AMD microarchitecture does not allow memory references, including speculative references, that access higher privileged data when running in a lesser privileged mode when that access would result in a page fault.”In this case, the issue reportedly has to do with an exploitable security flaw in the way that the kernel of the Microsoft Windows operating system interacts with Intel processors.A hacker could, hypothetically, take advantage of this undesirable interaction to bypass normal security measures. Microsoft's proposed fix could result in performance drops as high as 30% in PCs that run on Intel chips that were released as long as 10 years ago. The drop-in performance could lead to ""huge slowdowns in typical workloads, “according to the Python Sweetness developer blog. This will most likely affect Data Centers the most, and it has been said that it will not affect gaming, But the truth is no one knows for sure, since each application and game is coded differently if the game or application uses virtual memory it could be impacted greatly, most likely some programs and games will be affected and others will not. The fix requires a recode in how kernels and processors interact. The solution (Patch or Fix) requires processors to do more work in terms of security and isolating bits of the kernel, meaning a likely hit to performance.Additional overhead is introduced to maintain a barrier between memory address spaces, which can result in a performance handicap of 30 percent or more. Depending on your system and applications.The biggest problem is the companies that have virtualized environments, which is a lot of big name companies. They will see the performance hit the most.AMD processors aren't affected by the bug due to security protections that the company has in place. This also means that AMD processors shouldn't be affected by any performance hits.AMD""s latest EPYC data center server chips and Ryzen Pro enterprise desktop CPUs have Secure Memory Encryption technology on board, for additional protection against just these sorts of threat vectors.The problem with the INTEL software fix is in itself is a vulnerability. It is simply a band aid, to fix the problem short term. Since the problem is mostly hardware based, And Band Aids can be hacked too, and now the hackers know where to focus their efforts. The only real way for Intel to fix the issue is a total new hardware architecture, the problem is with that its it can take years to develop.This means even with the software temporary Band aid; Intel processors will still be venerable since sooner or later the band aid will be hacked too.Due to this problem I think we will be seeing many businesses move their server operations to AMD Epic over the next 24 to 36 months, they do not have the time to wait years for a new INTEL architecture to be developed. Their liability is here and now, and I am sure they are not willing to put their companies on the line with possible lawsuits due to this flaw that could have their customers personal data stolen. They simply will not take the chance. Also in the long term as far as INTEL reputation and trust have been tarnished with everyone, since they knew about this problem for a decade, and chose to cover it up, and from an outsider looking in view point the motivation seems to be greed, removing security features to obtain more speed out of their chips to enable them to justifying charging more for their product. This will now come back to haunt them. Now once the patch in place some people and systems will run much slower, and with a chip they paid much more for! I am sure this will result in many law suites, and could down the road devastate Intel as a company.",

"I found this article, written by an engineer and nuclear phycisit who seems to have more of a handle on these security issues than anyone else I have read, and he writes what is called the Arora Report.  He used algorithms to short both INTC and AMD, and he and his followers make a ton of money.  Read the article, as it is not only very interesting, but it finds that AMD also has security susceptibilities, despite the supposed denials by AMD.  He considers AMD highly over-priced with little upside.  Whereas, he finds INTC only briefly affected by the security breaches, and the company that will increase in value far more than AMD. http://on.mktw.net/2F6...Quoting some of the article pertinent to AMD:I am an electrical engineer who understands the matter at hand. There are a lot of “what this means” stories, but not many written for investors. That’s what I aim to do today.Dow Hits 25000: Here's Why It MattersAnalysis in advanceEarly in the morning when investors were panicking and selling Intel, The Arora Report wrote: “Intel cannot fix the flaw by simply upgrading the firmware. However, operating-systems vendors such as Microsoft MSFT, +1.24% and Apple AAPL, +0.04% have a work-around. In the end, it is not a big deal. ...”In our analysis, this incident is not likely to have material financial impact on Intel.Buy IntelSince this is not going to have a financial impact on Intel, the drop in the stock is likely to be a buying opportunity. At this time our algorithms need more data to determine the buy zone for another trade-around position and also to buy Intel for the long term for those who are not holding it. We will provide the buy zones to our subscribers as soon as they become available. Please note that Intel is an inexpensive stock in this expensive market. It is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of about 13, much below the overall market’s PE. The stock also has a nice dividend yield of 2.27%.Effect on AMDAMD has stated that, due to its different architecture, the probability of these flaws impacting its chips is near zero. On the other hand, Intel claimed that AMD chips also suffer from this situation. To get more insight into the conflicting statements, we look at an independent third party. The credible independent third party in this case is Google GOOG, +1.46% GOOGL, -0.03% Google discovered the flaws and explicitly mentioned AMD in the list of processors suffering from the flaws.In any case, AMD will slightly benefit from the situation.Our analysis is that, at best, AMD will gain about 5% in sales. The stock has already moved up more than that. At The Arora Report we took advantage of the situation and short-sold AMD for a very short-term trade. As a full disclosure the trade has already been closed profitably.Investors need to know that AMD is a high-beta stock, is fundamentally very expensive and mostly moves on sentiment. For this reason, at this time, it is a good trading stock but not a good very long-term investment unless something material changes. At The Arora Report we have completed several short-term trades on AMD but for long-term positions in the semiconductor sector, our positions include Intel, semiconductor ETF SMH, +0.65% Applied Materials AMAT, +0.16% Maxim Integrated Products MXIM, -2.08% Qorvo QRVO, -1.00% and Analog Devices ADI, +0.41%Nigam Arora is an investor, engineer and nuclear physicist by background, has founded two Inc. 500 fastest-growing companies, is the developer of the adaptive ZYX Global Multi Asset Allocation Model and the ZYX Change Method to profit from change in trading and investing. He is the founder of The Arora Report, which publishes four newsletters. Nigam can be reached at Nigam@TheAroraReport.c...So, I/we are sitting here convinced that INTC will be damaged beyond repair, and AMD has no issues.   An article like this needs careful consideration.  If the authors and posters who have written profusely in defense of AMD being immune to these issues cannot refute this man's claims with hard evidence, then it appears he is correct and others are wrong.Looking at the price drop in AMD today, after taking into serious consideration all that has been said by AMD and AMD supporters, is worrisome. IMO, it appears that all is not what it appears to be in AMD-land.  And, the demise of INTC perhaps completely misguided and wrong.",

These bugs (especially variant 3) is going to hurt the entire industry from a performance and possible sales standpoint.

Sorry, this positively drips with BS.Background (actually technical details, for the BS see the article above)The need to cross map the kernel and user space in x86 processors comes from the original architecture of the 80286 processor, which was carried forward into the 80386. These processors had hardware implemented tasking, meaning that you switch between tasks, or between the user and kernel, using ""gate"" instructions and the CPU does most of the heavy lifting.This includes swapping from a (completely different) set of user pages (its memory) and the kernel. With the kernel ""pages"" (its virtual memory) in a completely different space from the user pages, its like they live in two different universes, which any computer security analyst will tell you is ideal. Virtually all CPUs that implement virtual memory operate this way. The 80x86 processors just did way more of it in CPU hardware.Then the disaster hit: RISCRISC says that doing more and more in the hardware is the wrong design idea. Better to concentrate on making the CPU fast, and leave the rest to software. The 80x86 series embraced RISC (at last) in the 80586 series (yes, I know Intel stopped using that numbering system but that was the next logical number in that series).The result was nobody used the built in task switching in Intel CPUs, because it was... wait for it.... dirt slow. The problem then was that the isolated kernel pages and user pages went.... into... the dumpster as well. Note that other CPUs like ARM do not have this issue because they never had complex task management built into the CPU.The net problem is like this. You are standing HERE, on a page. You need to go THERE, to that page where the kernel is standing on. Think of it like you are standing on a tile floor. Each tile is a page. You want to LEAVE the user room, and ENTER the kernel room. You could swap all the user pages for kernel pages, but it would be like trying to retile the entire floor. Where are you going to stand while you are ripping up and replacing all those tiles?There are two answers: the first is, heck with it, just map the kernel and the user pages into the same group. You can reach anywhere. Its two rooms with a doorway. No issue.The second is to only map a FEW of those pages in common. Meaning, like any good retiler, you are going to reserve a few tiles to stand on while you rip up the floor and redo it.Now, why is any of this an issue? Because any good computer security guy (and any CIA dude as well) will tell you: security is: A. forbiding entry to stuff you want to secure and wait for it.... B. DON'T SHOW PEOPLE STUFF THEY SHOULDN'T ACCESS. Showing a classified document by holding it out and saying ""see, you can't look at this"", is not true security. Security is a wall. You can't go past it, you can't look through it. You could get the biggest bestest drill you can find, but you don't know where to drill, so you are hosed before you start.So Intel CPU OS designers woke up and realized that the simplistic idea of just mapping everything into a big ole ball of pages is not the right idea. Playing games with virtual pages like stepping onto the ""common area"" between the kernel and the user, then swapping to kernel pages and vice versa is costly, because you loose caching (memory optimization), but that is a well understood issue that we already solved. Modern virtualizable CPUs (and Intel) already support keeping different disjoint page sets cached to prevent this kind of swapping penalty.And lest we forget, being able to EXAMINE the kernel pages is not the same thing as breaking into them. That is two different steps.Thus, all this hysteria over ""my god its a CPU bug"", no, it is a decades old fact of OS design on 80x86 CPUs and it is easily dealt with.Sorry, much more fun to do ""sky is falling"" stuffs.",

I guess Intel CPU single core performance just took a hit!!! LOL,
"@Chris...Nobody who has a hypercenter online is going to rush out and replace it.  Intel may have to pony up some new silicon if the performance hit is major but likely Intel will just make a deal for upgrades that would limit AMD's participation.However new data centers will certainly look to AMD a little more favorably but again Intel can afford to take a hit on start up costs to again limit AMD's market penetration.Any data center who is now on the fence will likely make the switch to AMD, but I do not see much else happening with Intel houses or especially with Amazon or Google.Unless this exploit is truly a disaster and it is limited to Intel.  As far as the disaster part goes time will tell, however in all likelihood Intel QC is just spin.  They have had too many recent failures and they are connected as Microsoft started last November on a solution right after Homeland Security warned data centers to investigate.",

"Well, dear author, you have not got any clue what you are talking about here!Nor do I - or anyone for that matter at this very moment. We will have to wait for the official disclosure of what is going on.Intel has issued an official statement - read that. The other thing is that ARM might have a similar issue whatever that issue will turn out to be. Now what? Whatever might be the situation, Intel will do their best to rectify it. My take at the moment is that there is more of a general problem inflicting the industry. Chips are cost driven because of the markets they serve - and therefore have to strike a certain balance. The Intel Itanium (a big chip) was sort of laughed out of the market - nobody wanted to pay for any extra security and extra reliabilty. SPARC is a great architecture (like Itanium) and Oracle is killing it - too expensive and too expensive to maintain. Power 9 from IBM is gasping for air. And all those wonderful chips consume considerable more power - they have to. Nobody likes  that either. Also: All complex integrated circuits come with errors. Always. There is no single advanced chip on the market that has no error. Those errors are documented and usually are fixed or just stay in the silicon as known errors even across several generations. And when a successor comes to the market it has its own, new errors. What will happen is that the industry, including Intel, AMD and ARM will do their best to handle the what-ever-it-might-be security issue at hand. CIOs might consider to swap CPUs for an upgrade later 2018 or 2019 earlier that usual and Intel will might very well have an ""upgrade program"" in place offering better security features, yet another feature and a favorable price. All in all it will lead to additional sales for Intel in the corporate and cloud provider world. Intel will alsodesign even better server chips, this time incorporating FPGA technology and 3D XPoint memory. My current understanding is also that regular consumers and office PCs might not notice much of a difference if any. And yes, I think that AMD is a great company and their share price be beyond $20. Sometime in the future. And AMD will also greatly benefit from its business with graphics chips with Intel. That is additional business, weakens nvidia and AMD might even sell more to Intel than they sell to the OEMs who produce external graphics cards. .Sometimes it is better to shup up - especially if one has got a clue (yet). .",

ARM just announced that it's not an architectural flaw and they're working with Intel and AMD... why would they announce that if it's not true. I'm sure that the AMD fan boys will say it's a conspiracy.The real truth is that Intel continues to dominate because OEM's can rely on Intel to come out with new CPU's on a regular cadence and they have the capacity to supply the volumes that their customers need. AMD will at times have a superior product but shows no history of following up in the next generation. AMD will do OK in the consumer biz where there is little margin, Dell, HP, Lenovo will offer sku's to cover their bases just in case.

IMHO the Wilks brothers intend to get AREX making wells like you see on Linthicum.That is why they are getting in.  Look at the pattern of wells in far southeastern Reagan.Tons of doggy wells drilled by Devon and Enduring.  Only recently has Bold and Discovery put a 2017 designed frac on some wells and EUR is probably quadrupled.  Its a late blooming area that only a few that will sift individual well data will see coming,
correction: the NGL yield is around 150 bbl per 1mmcf,
"also NGL yield is around 50bbl/mmcf.so alot of the EUR is NGL barrels, which they count as equivalent to 1 barrel of oil.700 MBOE well is like 250 mbo + 2-3BCF and all those  NGLs",
These wells are TVD 6000-6500',
D&C 8 million is way too high.  More like $6.0 - 7.0 million.This is the cheap end of the basin.,
look at SEM wells couple miles into Irion... Linthicum wells.  These are the future for Crockett- depends on how long it takes AREX and EPE to adopt these practices.  Arex could be a $20 stock with wells like these,
"So AREX new reported type curve in earnings calls and other material is made up? The advancement of drilling and completion methods has changed much just in past two years = better results. This has been seen across the sector with some areas more than others. EPE has a sizable position in North Crockett adjacent to AREX. EPE did a joint venture with around 2/3 of it being Crockett county and completed  many more wells than AREX in 2017. Thus, you may try checking  EPE 2017 Crockett well results. On well results, we all know there is no comparison on oil % and results between central midland and southern midland... or the shale economics for any area at $45 vs $65. Due to oil geology, one cannot compare diamondback valuation to arex. However, southern midland has some things going in its favor such a) much improved type curve b) the depth is about half that of central and as such well cost is much much lower. It is kind of like crop ground ... i.e. central midland does have a much better yield. As such, at what discount should southern midland trade with lower yield? And of course like with crops.. a rising tide in crop prices lifts value of all fields for farmers, and the rising tide in oil will lift all the ships in energy. Wilks brothers are smart folks and time will tell who is correct about AREX - you or them? With a very high % of AREX true float sold short, you are not the only person that shares your position. However, just because you cannot find recent well results off a public website doesn't mean data released by a company is made up?",
Did AREX change the name of their operator entity? I can not find any information on recent completions. Their type curves are such BS as well. These wells need $90 oil for >15%IRR. Equity is worthless in this company as far as I can tell.,
How severe is the danger with oil at $40 till 2020?  ($1.50...or BK?),
Too late to buy more?,
Be nice to see  $4 handle!,
"There have been a few wells drilled and completed in the Wolfcamp D zone, a zone heretofore not tested on the AREX position.  the location of said wells are close enough to make me think the zone is viable across much of Arex acreage.  This would be a very much needed addition to inventory, especially if it is the most prolific in the Wolfcamp section.Other important developments will be drilling longer laterals and getting the rates and EUR up some more.  700 is good but they can do better.  If all these come together with oil prices rising AREX could be $10 stock in a year or 2",
"Thanks for the article. Agree, if oil continues upward slope, strong chance for a AREX short squeeze in 2018.  Much can happen in current upward path in energy and its impact on a small micro cap stock like arex between now and May, 7 2019.  Someone please correct me..... in January 27 2017 agreement, reference to ""$10"" floor  on any buyout offer (for wilks to vote shares) otherwise wilks have to vote with minority? It's been a year since I skimmed over agreement and could be wrong on this. Nonetheless, if that is the case ... mgt is indirectly saying $10 The only issue I see with arex currently is Liquidity to jump start new arex type curve in $60+ oil market. As arex share price goes up, I gather arex will need to issue some more shares or sell/lease back their mid stream water assets? Unlike most companies in shale, during the down cycle arex mgt did an excellent job of maintaining production while keeping arex capex within cash flow for the downturn years 2015, 2016, 2017.  During those years, I shake my head to understand why so many CEOs in oil borrowed money or issued shares to grow production while oil was in the $40's.  For 2018, is it time for arex to jump start the new well curve? Thus, hoping arex can up production in 2018 to take advantage of $60+ oil. The forecast for oil is looking very positive & 2018 has the ingredients to be a great year for energy sector. I would not be surprised if oil averaged $70 for 2018...",
"I also appreciate your article and am just trying to bring out what is an important and confusing issue.Arex has about 800 legacy wells, probably mainly gas and many doing less than 50 mcfd.  I’ve been to Farmington six times and seen their old gas wells where companies will do almost anything to avoid plugging them.The GAAP numbers are muddied when combined with the fabulous new 700 k type curve wells.",
There needs to be a discussion of the cost differential between the legacy wells vs new wells brought online since 2016.,
"Good article;How much more can Wilks buy in 2018? I am still unsure. But it looks like they are taking AREX private IMHO.

The reality is that these sw companies are working through this repositioning as we speak which could help Cloudera focus on the areas where they can excel.

"Great analysis. Both companies have to contend with competing products from cloud giants and we see that as significant long term risk to their businesses. The software industry is being disrupted by a gradual move to cloud computing, software-as-a-service in particular. This is the same challenge that older IT giants such as Oracle and IBM have and it will be interesting to observe if customers of big data software prefer Amazon (such as Amazon elastic map reduce, athena, redshift) and Microsoft cloud big data services in coming years or if they choose Cloudera and Hortonworks. Hortonworks has advantage of Microsoft cloud partnership but we see that the partnership was not exclusive as Microsoft also partnered with another big data cloud company (Databricks) for big data services on Microsoft Azure cloud. Both companies also have risk of operating under open source software model which is based on giving free software and charging for yearly support instead of software license. Cloudera has some licensed products but core Hadoop software is still free. It will also be very interesting to observe if free open software business is as profitable as license software business (such as the older software from Oracle, IBM or Tableau or Splunk in big data market).

I am not thrilled by this article and are you referring to data crunching or data crushing as you use both. This is a fast evolving market that will see all three companies disrupted. I find that Cloudera is more in favor for large enterprises like banks as they need the open source and proprietary software that is available to make it work in a practical world. Map R is a rounding error in today’s world so dont see them as a player. The big omission in this article are the Digital Giants such as Google and AWS. AWS is disrupting these companies as we speak as they declare themselves THE location for all Big Data. The future will be very “cloudy”,
"In contrast to HDP, CLDR does not position itself as a Hadoop company. It started off that way and Hadoop is a key component of their platform but their offerings are much broader than at that this point.  You barely even hear the word Hadoop in their conference calls now.  Another contrast with HDP is that CLDR has proprietary closed-source offerings whereas HDP strives to be 100% open source.The Feb 2017 Gartner report is really old and not relevant.  CLDR's newest data science offerings were all officially released after February.  It remains to be seen whether they will succeed against their competitors but it's only natural they were not evaluated in February because they did not have released products at that time. Much is made in this article about the Gartner ""magic quadrant"" but that is not only a dated data point, but also much less relevant than how the marketplace perceives Cloudera in terms of revenue and market share.Like many young, tech companies, CLDR does have spend a lot on stock based compensation, but it is in fact, LOWER, on a percentage basis than HDP.    For their last quarters respectively, CLDR's stock based comp was 33% of revenue ($31.1M out of $94.6M) vs HDP's 41% ($28.5M out of $69MM)CLDR also has a much stronger balance sheet than HDP and their CFO has guided to ""four to six quarters from estimated cash flow positive"" in their last call.  With a modest cash burn rate (only -$2.4MM operating cash flow last qtr) and $484MM in cash, cash equivalent, and marketable securities, they should have no trouble getting to cash flow positive without having to tap the public markets again.",

FYI WTI has a corp bond float that redeems June 2019. Original outstanding was $600M BUT currently only $189M. You can get these just under par for annualized yield of 9.5%. This would be a binary bet.,
We should get results the Mahogany A-17 well & an update on JV talks in the next conference call...WTI has been on a roll with regards to find oil & proving up reserves...,
I checked the options value On TOS and it’s more like 65 to 70,
"See Resolute Energy (REN) as an example of what can happen when a low-cap oil stock finally gets the attention it deserves.Very similar, except WTI has a lower ceiling at $15-18",
"I am a little bit surprised about that the excellent oilfield service company ARCHER.OL seems to pass below the radar of most oil and offshore analysts. The stock of this company has an upside of approx. 100% according to Pareto Securities analysts as is fairly clever on oil and offshore companies listed in Oslo, Norway.  The largest shareholder in Archer is shipping tycoon Fredriksen.",

Why was CRC halted today?,
At what rate do you see GXE growing beyond 2019 assuming WCS >$50? How scalable is their business model in your opinion?,
2 shares of BP per CRC share and I'd vote for that...effectively 43 x 2 for each share of CRC.,
"HFIR, have you considered a merger possibility with an oil super major? I have thought BP would be an ideal candidate. They recently spun out their midstream operations (elk hills and the like) and could gobble up CRC then spin off the midstream AND THE DEBT to BP’s midstream arm.. providing immediate accretion for their earnings to the tune of about 1b ebitda less the mid stream piece.. I believe BP experience with Brent pricing, as well with 3rd world country politics ( calif fits this bill) and their desperate need for increasing reserves they would be a very interesting fit... they could offer 1.5-2 shares of BP stock per CRC and the share count would barely budge for them.. the only question I’m still researching is the midstream ebitda contribution.. in any event if you have a thought I’m all ears",
Referring to CRC,

How much of CRC's rise has been a short squeeze or is that still to come?,
"Don't buy crap like CRC, buy quality driller like CRZO.",
"As I handicap CRC, the JV capital given the depth of inventory is a perfect remedy only in a rising oil price environment since it's like making a deal at $45 oil with oil at $65. Oh they did that.. so the payback and ownership of the future cash flows reverts back to CRC with greater speed and stem the declining production even more quite possibly reversing the decline. Secondly, the free cash that continues to build b4 the JV wells come back to CRC will be used to reduce debt whether the unsecured or even possibly the more expensive higher priority debt. thirdly, the little 100mm ATM equity piece will augment the speed of debt paydown.  I suspect CRC if oil holds $65-70, will likely get an offer. A Super Major trapped inside an E&P  per the CFO of CRC?  ANY solid integrated that is looking for reserves,low depletion rates and an ability to use its cash for the benefit of the shareholder is exactly what is going on these days with Return metrics front and center.. My guess is XOM or COP maybe BP would look to buy them given all 3 are in desperate need of reserve replacement without the capital destructive ways of the past. With the cash on the balance sheet of the super major's building, why not make an immediately accretive acquisition. short rates are paying zero and shale is a very capital intensive and crowded short cycle answer. SO you offer $35 a share for CRC and watch what happens next. I believe they sell at $51...the super major gets a world class reserve base, an immediate 1b in ebitda and it cost what again? PV-10 at $65 is closer to 6.5b?  and the best way for the super major to get in at an even greater discount is to start buying up all the debt at a discount... The only problem I see is the flaming idiots in the California legislature that want to ban gasoline powered autos by 2040...",

"Been a CRC shareholder off and on since spin. Bought huge position on day they got NYSE delist notice $3.xx, price post split. I think these guys have managed the environment/debt pretty much as well as anyone could have done. However, there has been a lot of damage done over last few years as declining production has been substantial. $60 Brent steady state they could die in next recession because they might not have enough firepower to bring on new production and take care of the debt. The 3x FCF is very deceiving as they are underinvesting and have the debts looming. That being said I do have a large position since I believe the optionality CRC has to Brent is an unbelievably favorable situation. $70 Brent is a huge win for them and I personally believe Brent will trade at large premium to WTI for foreseeable future, so CRC will start to look better and better vs its US peers. I also think you have a lot of natural buyers to the stock as the distressed debt guys close their trades by selling bonds and buying back the short stock. This could be a big help.",

"The article is a good start, but I think the estimated sales for Canada might be vastly underestimated, which would really change the numbers.  The article estimates future sales at only $600,000,000.  At a conservative $6 per gram, that is 100,000,000 grams.  Times 1,000 is only 100,000 kilos for all of Canada plus its exports.  If we assume a typical consumer would consume approximately an ounce a week with 35 ounces per kilo, then that $600,000,000 would only support a market of about 67,300 consumers.  That might be accurate for current medical sales but it is most certainly wrong for 2018's anticipated recreational sales.  Plus it excludes potential sales at higher price points - organics, for example.  I think the market in Canada has much more potential for a few years until supply catches up with demand.  If only 5% of the Canadian population purchases marijuana on a regular basis, that is more than 1.8mm consumers.  Also the comments regarding market maturity are vastly overgeneralized.  The US has several states with established recreational markets while Canada is expected to begin national recreational sales later in 2018.",
Roman do you have any thoughts on Diego Pellicer? (ticker DPWW) They are a real estate investment company. They lease properties to several MJ dispensaries in CO and WA.

With roughly $1.2 million in revenue for the previous 4 quarters and a market cap of $3.6 million (trading at 6 cents/share and 60 million outstanding shares) they seem slightly undervalued.

There is sovereign risk associated with US stocks because the activity of selling marijuana for recreational use is deemed illegal by the federal government. Secondly, the current Attorney General has expressed apprehension to easing off on enforcement.   By comparison, in July of 2018, the sale, possession, and consumption of recreational marijuana will be legal across Canada.  Current sales listed for Canadian companies do not yet reflect this new potential market.  The Canadian traded companies have just recently been included on the Toronto Stock Exchange Index and sub indexes of the exchange.  Thus, they have become illegible to be acquired by many, many, many institutional investors.  Finally, the ""legal"" status of the Canadian traded and Canadian based MJ companies allows them to take advantage of traditional tax avoidance strategies that their American counterparts cannot.  This provides significant lift to the bottom line now and in  the future.

My point is we have no idea what the language is in these contracts regarding deliveries, cancelation rules if any. I feel much too much weight is put on orders when Airbus has shown it will go to any length to book sales on paper.I once heard a respected sales professional at a seminar. One of his golden rules was never put a sales person in charge of sales - it's like putting unattended kids in a candy store. Sales and order discipline goes out the window.Ifthe Airbus backlog is as strong as Boeing's the delivery picture would be very different than what we are seeing. IMHO :)",

"Well, not to beat a dead horse on the Boeing/Airbus order numbers, but . . . ;-)Referencing:  http://bit.ly/1VFQj5hLeaving aside 2017, which appears to be a virtual tie, on the order front, in the years 2012 - 2016, Airbus' order totals were 5,602 vs. Boeing's 5,426 but the delivery numbers were Airbus: 3166; Boeing: 3842. Big difference in the deliveries, which is when the actual sale occurs. Airbus won four of those five yearly order races and it appears 2017 will make it five out of six years but with Boeing delivering more planes for the sixth straight year, although the delivery numbers are closing.As to investing, I am curious which exchange those of you who are investing in Airbus, are using, since Airbus is listed on four different exchanges - something I find confusing (with different stock symbols)? OK, so I'm not a sophisticated investor - guilty! ;-) But, one thing I look at being significant, is the PE ratio and Airbus is certainly high, if you can find it (most of the sites I regularly use, don't show it)? One I did find (yCharts) shows that it hit 92, in September of last year!

"Rushing to move orders that would normally close in 2018 into 2017 simply to beat-out Boeing will result in fewer orders in 2018, so the only thing accomplished is some PR. What's that worth? Bottom line for me is for 2017 my Airbus stock is up 50%, Boeing is up 95%. Let the battle continue!",
"Could it be that Airbus on a couple of these mega orders, have convinced buyers to pull in orders which were perhaps scheduled for 2018 or later? Deliveries of course will be scheduled out over several years, but perhaps some ordering gymnastics were done, leading me to believe we should watch order volume in Jan-March of this year as a key indicator.",
"The order battle is always an interesting pride item, but as it counts an A380 equal to an A320, it is far from being a great business measure.  In fact, it is amazing that Airbus could sell that many airplanes, and not count one wide body in the list.  It is also notable however that Boeing only has a couple in your preliminary list, but if there are any unexpected orders completed, I would anticipate that number to go up.",

If AMZN is so obsessed with physical stores then they should just build their own.  Paying any premium for Target makes no sense when Amazon has a better brand to start with.,
"My take on Amazon and Rite Aid- Amazon takes over the pharmacy licenses in all the states, also aquiry knowledgable inside exectutives, real estate, and operating pharmacies ( they will need retail locations for 1 hr pick up ).  But the big payoff for Amazon are the 3,600 locations for pick up and drop off lockers, which will save shipping and insurance costs, probably enough to pay for the entire buy out.  Last year appoximately 26 million packages were reported stolen, and with Amazon controlling 50% of online sales, this would add up to billions in losses.

Target is a company with long history in the Retail Business, It has hot real estate, stores at premier locations, well designed store fronts, good merchandise. Retail is still a business where customer comes to shop and prefers to shop. Not every thing can be e-commercized, if it can be Target should be able to do that too. Target should have founded a startup / spinoff that could leverage the ecommerce trade and then introduce those advantages to Target or use that as a vehicle to leverage the ecommerce benefits if they exist. Anyway Amazon buying Target would lead to monopoly. Before that happens Target should bring good leaders to the strategy team or move its headquarters to Seattle where most of the companies monopolizing their business seem to operate.",
"I don't see the rationale clearly. Wal-Mart blocking moves make enough sense, but I don't think they'd need to overpay for warehouse space/B+M footprint when they could repurpose the WFM stores toward some of that end. e.g..  drop aisles currently displaying dry goods that could be shipped instead (and give WFM shoppers a convenient way to place that order while in store), and use that freed space for the target items that would benefit from letting customers touch them IRL.  I'm not proclaiming certainties, just MHO. Curious what others think.",
"M&A giddy days are here again!  Speculation is running rampant, but fortunately cooler heads will prevail at HQ, especially at AMZN.  TGT marriage with AMZN makes so no sense from either side, but both are doing just fine on their own, thank you.",
"TGT would be a good strategic purchase for Amazon and would allow them to compete profitably with Walmart. They could use their bubble stock to obtain the assets cheap. Of course, it would lead to the recognition that B&M isn't going away and that they needed to acquire to be competitive and profitable long term. This would hurt the stock price.",
Amazon can't continue business-as-usual forever.  eventually they've got to start making some profit and the only way to do that is to increase prices - Walmart and Target will gain some share - eventually. Personally I like the idea of purchasing at Walmart or Target for the returns convenience.,
"Why would amazon buy target? It has much less overhead than target and is crushing brick and mortar.  All they have to do is continue business as usual and brick and mortar stores will go out of business, then they can buy the empty building and use it as warehouses across the nation...   no red buggies (shopping carts for you northern folk) necessary...",

But think a bit more to go.  We are very early in this saga.,
"It didn't make any sense to me for AMZN to buy WFM either, but here we are.I think most of this talk of acquiring TGT is just spitballing though. Not quite as crazy as some folks saying AAPL would consider buying NFLX at current market cap, but in the ballpark.",

"Caleb, Thanks for the time and effort to write the article..Just my observations but it doesn't seem like any of the company's purchased were for Revenue as much as they were for expanded capability. No doubt we got a few million in revenue here and there but from 2014-2017 Swir has gone from 550 mil to nearly 700 mil in revenue in 2017. None of the purchases came with that kind of revenue to account for the growth.Another point is the dilution. If you look back 2 years on the share count we are adding 3.6 m for NMRX but we retired 800k+ shares in buybacks during the last 24 months. So net around 2.8mil which makes me think smart use of the balance sheet and I'm thinking they are kicking themselvesFor not being more aggressive when the share price was 10.2018 will be the transition year as we get more traction and larger volume with these pilot projects.If you keep an eye on the local papers regarding smart city proliferation, Evolving auto industry and smart manufacturing seems Sierra is destined to be a key player for years to come. It would seem that it is not a matter of ""if"" but a matter of whom and for how much will be paid for a company like SWIR.I only hope that Sierra can realize a good portion of their potential prior to any potential takeover.

"@puddn,"" I think a lot of people (including many here) are overestimating the real world consequences of this for Intel, and underestimating for AMD. ""If you mean that we may find Intel and AMD have equal issues under Spectre I would see that as a wash. What still seems material at the moment (unless there is more information that hasn't been mentioned) is that Intel suffers some performance degradation due to requiring a patch for Meltdown. AMD not needing that path doesn't.What am I missing?What the recent statement above seems to be saying is that while AMD doesn't think a fix is needed they are going to provide one anyway so people can't go around saying AMD doesn't have a fix for Spectre anymore.",
"Maybe less technical people are finally figuring out they have Spectre vulnerability after all.  I think AMD's initial statements last week gave the wrong impression the other way.  When I posted last Thursday that I was trying to short in premarket when it was trading close to $12.50, that was reason why.

"To tell frankly Wall Street should not even look at 4th Qtr earnings or 1st Qtr earnings in details. They should just make sure the rising trend is there. Let me explain why.Ryzen Desktop CPU came out in March 2107. Then we all were in confusion. Its not selling well. No OEMs have systems based on Ryzen. Look today. Its everywhere. All OEMs have it.http://bit.ly/2FsyR2KSo the point is that once AMD releases a product it eventually starts selling in volume. What it takes is a little bit more time than we expect. We can think about the ramp up cycle between 9 months to a year.Also the story has really changed in the last few days. With all the lies, obfuscation, trying to deflect its own problems to others and insider trading Intel is no longer considered as a fair , powerful, innovative company. CEOs realize they need to diversify their IT assets from Intel. Intel will still be there but no more as the sole supplier of CPU components. By 2018 Intel will no longer have better process or architecture.http://bit.ly/2qPMEgEhttp://bit.ly/2Ftp4cDThis means its just a matter of time that AMD will take significant market share from Intel. Vega Graphics technology is also really good. AMD is able to put this technology in all kinds of devices, hence the slogan ""Vega everywhere"". So AMD will have significant market share in Graphics market too. AMD is just getting started in Autonomous driving. So next few years will be big growth years for AMD. There is just no need to worry about actual revenues or gross margins. They will definately be much better every  quarter than previous. All we need is to monitor that they are growing. No need to split hair regarding the details.(This reminds me of @user18..)The above is very clear in my mind now. Is that clear in Wall Street mind too? I just dont know. Its just a different animal. If you listen to all these news outlets like CNBC you get a feeling they only have superficial knowledge. Is this a common pattern in the entire Wall Street regarding technology companies. Another problem is that most of the investment decisions are taken by Algos looking at past data. This data is slowly improving for AMD but will it be caught by these Algorithms. I dont know.",
"KC - Everybody. I have a confession. This is a true story of a day in the life of Lee.The day they announced the discovery of the Intel bugs.

At first I thought ""Oh my god this is really bad, they froze my shares of Intel.""The shock of my missing stock instantly woke me up! Then I realized a few weeks ago, it was early morning in Southern California where I live, I had been up until around 3:00am pacific time the night before researching some new stocks. It was then a little after 5:00am. I was awake for the market to open eager to make some trades. Being half asleep I accidentally clicked sell 100% INTC. When I realized I did this, I thought to myself, ""no big deal, the stock is going to go down soon and I will buy it back equal or better than now.""

"Yeah, AMD is really working, isn't it?  Down to 11.71, about 4.5%, while Intel is down .60%? It is PATHETIC that AMD can't even hold TWELVE!  While what the Intel articles say is showing to be true.  The chart looks FAR better, which I had to call out from the poster on another article who gave cherry-picked and incorrect chart analysis of the two, when the Intel chart was far, far better, with a break-out that stalled with the security vulnerabilities news, which, as many have predicted, will hardly put a dent in Intel, and recommend it as a buy.So much for Lisa Su's comments, where she tried to gloss over, but still admit, that their chips have security vulnerabilities; perhaps not all, particularly the server chips, but that doesn't dismiss that it also has issues.",

She added that she cannot comment on Tesla deal as we generally dont talk about it. I did my part",
"The author fails to address the security flaws issue at all.  The same group of pro-AMD devotees run from article to article, posting constantly, and, I'm frankly tired of it.Everyone ignores electronic engineer, Nigam Arora and his Arora Report.  He and his followers have made significant money in shorting AMD and buying INTC on this security issue drop.  He sees INTC as benefiting substantially from this, and AMD getting a small increase.No matter how much pontification is written on how AMD is not affected by security flaws, there has been plenty written that it is, and NOT just the 2 older processors Google's study, but the defenders here simply argue the point.Quoting Arora:""The credible independent third party in this case is Google (GOOGL) (GOOGL). Google discovered the flaws and explicitly mentioned AMD in the list of processors suffering from the flaws.  In any case, AMD will slightly benefit from the situation.  Our analysis is that, at best, AMD will gain about 5% in sales. The stock has already moved up more than that. At The Arora Report we took advantage of the situation and short-sold AMD for a very short-term trade. As a full disclosure the trade has already been closed profitably.  Investors need to know that AMD is a high-beta stock, is fundamentally very expensive and mostly moves on sentiment. For this reason, at this time, it is a good trading stock but not a good very long-term investment unless something material changes. At The Arora Report we have completed several short-term trades on AMD but for long-term positions in the semiconductor sector, our positions include Intel, semiconductor ETF (SMH), Applied Materials (AMAT), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), Qorvo (QRVO) and Analog Devices (ADI).""His comments on AMD sorely hit home with me.  The expectations on AMD are bloated.  We will be lucky if it even reaches a $15 target, IMO.I wanted to give my thoughts, and present a totally different viewpoint, which makes a good case for itself.

AMD does not have this problem and has special circuitry to protect under security threats.http://bit.ly/2EDhTy9AMD revenues, products are now far superior than ever.

There will be urgency by all of the Super 7 Cloud providers to have heterogenous systems so that they are not effected by one vendor. Google is now using OpenCAPI standards, Microsoft Project Olympus. The open standards are CCIX,GEN-Z, OPENCAPI and AMD is part of all of them. Intel is not.http://bit.ly/2ECSNj2All this means Dr. Kwan's Price Target of $16-$17 is probably on the lower side. AMD is where it is now because of Reputation problem.

And keeps the cash earned in the low tax country for international expenses.This tax business is not as simple as we say it is. Or corporations will not need tax attorneys and CPAs who Apple pays probably $100 - 200 million a year.Elected leaders are idiots. There is no reason to have five departments doing the same thing: collecting taxes....IRS, state tax department, sales tax, and many taxes hidden in utility bills. Imagine Apple having five departments doing the same thing.USA should consider eliminating all taxes and bonds, etc. and replacing it with just one sales tax. It would free up a million plus attorneys, CPAs, the friendly IRS and local tax departments to take up positions that we bring in H1B's for. And it would bring in enough savings to balance the budget being spent on salaries and pensions of our so very loved IRS employees. And it may even make enough savings to make healthcare free for all.",
"One flaw in your analysis, all overseas profits up to 2017 are deemed ""repatriated"" under the law regardless of whether they are actually transferred to the US.  So Apple will pay the 15.5% regardless",
"Why doesn't AAPL buy Fitbit & GoPro?  Together, for around $6-8B they could take out their largest competitors in both wearables and mobile camera.  They could integrate all devices into AAPL's ecosystem and add all existing device users to their services. They would also be acquiring a lot of useful and marketable health data. I realize there may be some redundancy and perhaps these devices aren't up to snuff with AAPL's standards and/or are iOS incompatible, but those hurdles could be addressed.",
This is what Apple should do. Tell investors that they will increase the dividend 10-15 % per year for the next 10 years. Apple will get the share count to 5 Billion and keep it there. Apple will pay off all long term debt as it comes up to maturity.,
"Hi Bill,We don't see any special dividend coming out of Apple, but we do see a gradual, planned increase in dividend payments stretching into the future. Ten years from now, Apple will be honored as a ""dividend champion"" which continues to raise its uninterrupted dividend stream on an ongoing basis. As such, shareholders will remain sticky and corporate financial strength will only grow.With the unabated acceleration of technology on all fronts, Apple will be overwhelmingly well-served to use its cash for product and service development, and we're pretty certain it will.Just throwin' it out there...Heidi, Helga, Clarissa, Desiree and Schnitzel",

"Bill, you suggest paying a special dividend makes no sense but AAPL continues to sit on the cash (years now) and has made no substantial investments in the business itself which is the ONLY reason a company should ever be allowed to sit on cash for a time. You state that this 'cash' is earning a return for AAPL shareholders but it could be earning an even bigger return by deployed elsewhere (via shareholders). It's what's known as 'opportunity cost'.AAPL shareholders who advocate for the company hanging onto the cash are basically acknowledging the company as a quasi fund manager. Is fund management really AAPL's strength? Or is it making smartphones?It's often been said that AAPL is morphing into a hedge fund with a side-line in the technology business. That being the case, I certainly hope that AAPL's fund managers have the right investment mix for when the next crisis hits as that huge 'cash pile' could end up a modest 'cash pile' .... while the debts owed will not have changed.",

Hey! You do know that Investors are the owners of a public company. They are not some distant relative that is asking for a handout. The CEO and Managers work for the stockholders. Returning the profits to the owner (stockholders) is what the company was set up to do.So understand that dividends are the basis of owning stocks (unfortunately most people have acquired a traders mentality and think that this is the purpose of the market). So lets return most of that cash to the owners.,
"Author states:""However, it is not a given that Apple will just bring back all of its money and throw a huge chunk of money to the US government.""Are you suggesting that paying this tax is not mandatory?",
"I am of the thinking that they should increase the dividend to double current amount since now they will be able to repatriate all the profits from abroad. Their payout rate will still be less than 50% of net income/net cash flow.And use the current cash hoard to buyback stock and retire debt.If these two happens and their earnings are still on positive track, I expect apple to cross 200 very soon. Anyone disagrees?",
"Khwemz good comment on AAPL's cash tax payments and reversal of accruals which is actually very complex, not a simple reversal of 35% accrual, with one rate minimum on foreign earnings. A different rate of foreign patents etc, Irish situation, not enough public info to call the accrual reversals yet",
"No auditor would allow Apple to consolidate their worldwide income and not accrue taxes on it. With that assumption if one reads Note 5 of the latest 10K-form published by Apple, one gets a clear picture of their tax position. Apple has been accruing taxes on its world wide income @35% except for the income from Ireland. Historical income from Ireland not subject to Tax is $109 Billion (Note 5 figures). Hence Apple would have to take a P&L hit for the taxes on this consolidated income @15.5% less the Irish tax. However it will get a reversal on the excess accrual on all the other world wide income which it has been accruing all these years. I think we can expect to see net reversal on account of tax instead of the huge tax liability which is being assumed by all and sundry.",

"I mostly agree with much you have said about the financial aspects of Apple's cash decision. What you haven't said is that Apple is a company which is always working on plans that come to fruition a minimum of 10 to 20 years in the future. What will the world look like in 10 to 20 years? Well, as a general direction it seems we are indeed going to head into distributed network systems and IOT, enabled by both device and network AI transaction management. This will require huge infrastructure expenditures over time. It will also require a global development approach. A big focus for Apple will have to be acquisition of new technology and intellectual property, which will require rapid decision making and execution to acquire key assets before the competition (most likely Google). Europe, the Balkans, China and India are already neck and neck with, and in some areas surpassing, the U.S. in developing the exotic new technology of the future. China is expected to become the leader in AI development. Also, I believe if Apple ever does get involved in building an electronic smart car, it will begin in China, where it is already investing in ride-sharing technology, the need is great and the government will be a supporter because of those needs. Launching this product successfully would be virtually impossible with the auto and oil industry protections in the U.S. and Germany. Just look at what Tesla has had to contend with just trying to build a dealership network in many American states.Given the situation, I really can't see any logical on-the-ground strategic advantage for Apple to bring more than a fraction of its overseas capital back home. It can be put to use building data and systems infrastructure as well as some important acquisitions overseas. Someday, financial students will look back on this period of Apple's corporate history and understand that its move into countries like China and India was not just about opening new markets but establishing itself as a global company. Its lucrative foreign earnings success will be a propitious springboard at this time in Apple's growth for the coming of a new technological age. iPhone, by-the-way will be seen as the product that took Apple global and made it all possible, but will not be a dominant part of Apple's business in 20 years. Steve Jobs's last words were reportedly, ""Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow!"" Perhaps this was a reaction to the veils of time being lifted during his transition so that he could see clearly the future of Apple.",

"Just want to point out that in the case of an acquisition, Apple does not necessarily have to take a 100% interest. It could instead opt for sufficient stakes to gain either (1) controlling interest (i.e., less than 50% since ownership of most securities is widely distributed), and or (2) majority interest (i.e., 50% + 1). The former option would allow compatible direction with other Apple products and developments while permitting a range of options to allocate their cash reserves in diverse ways to serve multiple goals and interests. On the other hand, should Apple elect to do this, this would be breaking new ground in terms of its strategic options.An additional point is that on a go forward basis, Apple is likely to gain about $50B free cash flow in 2018 and 2019, given the super cycle in the new phone and growth of other product and service lines. When adding this to current cash reserves, and considering that the after tax take of the company will be much enhanced by the new lower corporate tax rate, let's just say that Apple has lots of options and what is entirely possible is ""ALL THE ABOVE"".",
"Thanks for the analysis, Bill. I always appreciate reading your articles. My vote won't matter but I am most comfortable with Apple's use of free cash-flow to date (Borrowing, given tax vs. interest rates in particular.).

"""Every $10 billion of cash earns about $200 million of interest a year, which equals about a penny in earnings per share pre-tax""Apple's earnings on cash equivalents at about 2% are way below their WACC Bill.

"Great article, this is a gem, low float etc. in addition to ALL of the facts you laid out.Another huge plus is the focus the Trump Admin & Rick Perry is placing on the importance of nuclear energy to our GRID. With the GRID resiliency pricing rule being produced, infrastructure bill, and an administration who understands that our nation needs NE to keep up with China, Russia etc. to power our electric cars, cryptocurrency mining, devices, robots etc. LTBR is in such a sweet spot, with a capable partner (Areva). I think the GRID resiliency pricing rule will be altered a bit, but it still benefits the Nuclear Energy (NE) sector, and good for LTBR. It basically guarantees profitability to nuclear power companies.Bob Freeman on the Bloomberg interview spoke about how this fuel is a game changer for the industry & the excitement\eagerness of the big power companies have towards it. I’ve been pointing out some of the historical multi-Million Dollar contracts Areva has landed, which in most cases are 3 years prior to delivery.  Seth & company have been saying 2021, hmm 3 years from JV launch. Once LTBR hits a market cap of $150 Million, many ETF & funds can add, per their prospectuses. This will finally attract institutional investors, all starting because of the biggest milestone in companies history you mentioned.  Once institutional money comes in around $13 per share we go to yet another level. If you compare this to other R & D related tech, biotech type companies Seth and Team have done a really good job keeping this at such a low float.

Bears state the many false starts in Lightbridge history and have concluded any future projections by Seth will similarly fizzle. But the difference is the level of commitment we are seeing from Areva both in social media and on their own website. Investors can either remain skeptical of the past unfulfilled promises or consider, like you and myself that Seth is not entirely to blame, given the industry turmoil, and that the stock is a rare buying opportunity since investors haven't woken up to the sea-change this JV will present. The EDF/Areva corporate reorg was a huge risk for Lightbridge, EDF and Areva. The fact it is over and the JV wasn't scuttled is a huge relief. However one thing still holding the stock back is we need more details about dates and dollars.

"""At this time SolarEdge has been able to avoid being a commodity company by designing its solar inverters with a charger, which differentiates from its competitors."" In practice, this just the way DC works. SE topology lets the same inverter do double duty, Grid export and Local AC Power - but requires deployment of NON STANDARD batteries which fail as they age, get wet or cold/hot. Requiring complex eChem storage for PV power generation is poor design especially considering incompatibility with 99+% of ALL Batteries, By design, a SE PV system is useless without the utility. Think of a petrol can which cannot dispense! The never produced in quantity DC Powerwall is discontinued and many of the current Li metal oxide type batteries are ""NOT SUITABLE FOR USE"" for stationary use per national codes for reasons that have nothing to do with safety.  Storage is overrated, concentrate on basic generation and storage will happen when it happens. GTM says only 3.5% of kWh need storage. We have installed hundreds of SE systems, and want to install thousands, but can't ethically sell systems with ZERO standalone utility when there are better options. Storage systems will struggle since eChem storage dramatically increase power costs without careful designed separate load management.  SE has failed to deliver on the announced Life-giving ""Sustainable power""  or Universal 50V Charger options.  Transportation is a necessity,  SE should independently utilize DC Fast Charge EV ports, For SE the hardware is all there already. Such synergy could sell millions of SE PV systems and EVs.

Their latest microinverter, the IQ7, will be released this quarter that is almost the size and weight of an Optimizer (1.7 lbs vs 2 lbs) yet is much more powerful (can be configured to meet regulatory requirements of any geography) and does not require a bulky expensive prone to break down string inverter to convert DC to AC.   That will be followed in Q1 next year by the IQ8, again more powerful (off grid capable), small, lighter all at a much lower price point.''I think it will have to go beyond that and offer a complete solution by including an inverter, energy storage unit and charger all in one unit. This would provide a moat while improving long-term revenue, margins and earnings prospects of the company.''ENPH is just now releasing a new version of exactly what you describe.  It's called the IQ battery.  They are the only company that can offer this product, a small module battery, because they are the only company that has a bi directional microinverter (spending 100M to develop it).ENPH's prior CEO made the exact same mistake back in 2014 that you are making today...ignoring the sleeping giant in the room.In 2013 ENPH owned 40% of the US residential market and SEDG, after selling basically the same products they do today (string/optimizer), owned all of 4%.  By the end of 2015, thanks to a marketing tsunami from SCTY, they owned closer to 40% while ENPH dropped closer to 20%.The bottom line is simply roles for both companies reversed very quickly and clearly unexpectedly for the leader.

"Matt, thanks for the article. but I don't see much growth at Cooper.  IMO replacement tire customers fall into one of two groups.  Those who replace tires with the OEM brand, which you pointed out in the article. This is why OEMs basically sell tires to the auto manufactures at cost (or just above cost).  As far as I know, Cooper is not an OEM supplier.   The other group of replacement tires buyers are those who look for the low cost replacements, and Cooper is not a low cost replacement tire company.    Imports where typically $20 to $50 cheaper.  Cooper may attract customers because they are American company, but my attempt to purchase American made Cooper tires for my passenger car was unsuccessful.  According to my local tire vendor, the Cooper passenger tires I needed, were not produced in the USA.    The only venue I see for growth is developing a high performance tire, which can be sold at a premium. But they will need to invest more in brand marketing to compete with companies like Goodyear, Michelin, etc.",Cooper Tire: Favorable Trends Driving Upside

Putin said: “Modern technology in the banking sphere certainly opens up new opportunities for organisations and citizens, making business activity and everyday life more convenient.”",
"I am trying to figure out how ""Qiwi would be the key processor of the BitRubles transactions, earning a percentage of every transfer.""  Is it your belief that Qiwi intends to act as a crypto exchange the same way Binance, Kraken, etc do; i.e., by allowing people to exchange rubles for bitrubles? If that is the case, my concerns  are: (1) they are behind all the other exchanges....also, why wouldn't they start trading cryptocurrencies now as opposed to waiting for the bitruble and (2) there are a lot of competitors out there....I guess Qiwi would have the kiosks, but i don't know how many people still use kiosks in Russia...I definitely think Russia will push cryptos hard (to evade sanctions, weaken the dollar further, etc), i just wonder if Qiwi is THE company to benefit",

I think an atm or kiosk comes in handy for the next few years while we transition. especially in 3rd world countries. I might store my crypto on wallet but need cash to buy veggies at farmers market. but in general I agree. 5 years down the Road everything will be digital. but this might ease the transition and might be another reason Putin wants to use qiwi to introduce the crypto ruble.,
"I definitely see the connection between Kiwi and the Russian government. Thank you for that. However, I’m struggling to see how Kiwi is a good investment. How much of their revenue is through sale and use of their kiosks? I ask because I don’t think ATMs or “kiosks” are going to be around in 10 years.

Before the Oktritie tender, I had nearly doubled my investment , only to see all my profits evaporating. The dividends have been great but with the benefit of hindsight I wish I had opportunistically traded the stock rather then buying and holding.To me their blockchain and cryprtocurrency involvement provides some welcome optionality but is not the main reason for owning the stock. It is the rise of e-payments (especially in the e-commerce and money transfer verticals) plus innovative financial products like Sovest that get me excited on this company and its growth prospects.I can't complain about the recent appreciation of the share price that benefits me, but I would attribute this to hype / speculation as opposed to a change in the fundamentals of the company.",
Still amazed at the “ lack of movement “ relevant to crytomania..seems a tea company can get more interest than a rock solid legit financial enterprise but still believe this will go back to highs in no time,
"Appreciate the article.What I like about QIWI is that without a crypto currency they have an active real business. The risk reward is much better than most.Would be interested to see how a state ran crypto currency would fair in Russia. If my month long stay there taught me anything its there is a great distrust for Government and anything state ran. The more trusted,favorable exchange rates I did were in alleys,in one case behind a bank. Its easy to see how Russia would want their own alternative to other crypto currencies.",
All in all a very good piece!A couple of points:1) Good explanation of why the Holding company transferred the shares to the Bank. The missing SEC filing remains a problem though!

For one, we will not be hiring a Chief Operating Officer. Layers of management are being eliminated to provide more direct accountability from our operations to our corporate leaders. With fewer layers, I believe we can be more responsive as an organization to our customer and operational needs.""link to Q4-2013:https://seekingalpha.c...",

"I was rather surprised by how much MDR sold off on the CBI news, to me MDR has proven they can manage a turn around in a capital intensive and cyclical industry and the timing of the buy seems very opportunistic of MDR, using their recently appreciated shares to buy a company that was trading at one of its lowest prices in the past 10 years. Clearly, risks have increased, but so too has their opportunity set. I'm a fan.",

After assessing the prospects of a company going forward, difficult at the best of times, I then ask myself when making a buying or selling decision, could this double in 5 years.    Cheers !!!",
"Reason #6 is the key here. The ONLY way to turn CBI around is to commit wholesale slaughter in its management ranks, including local department heads, and then bring in a whole new team at all levels. One reason the stock is still in the toilet is that CBI has lost investor confidence and shows no sign of having learned any lessons.",
"I am not too sanguine on the prospects for offshore drilling although the proposed roll back of the Deepwater Horizon regs has to be a good thing for MDR. However, diversifying into the tech, nat gas and storage spaces occupied by CBI is a bold move on their part and the structure of the deal impressed me from the point of view of MDR shareholders. I have come around to MDR as a result and also went long at $6.45. I look smart today but we shall see what happens longer term. The saber rattling around the world and the cold weather has put a bid into oil (my son trades heating oil options on the mercantile exchange and that market is hot, no pun intended). So far so good. The cycle, the chart and the valuations all seem to say ""bargain"" as well but truthfully it is all about oil and nat gas.",
"Hi Cory, interesting take on a strategy to win here. I bought and sold a bit of CBI last year and recently sold it all, and have now entered MDR. CBI has recently been a play thing of the market, with daily bear raids able to move the stock 10% plus on no news. For me, these are stocks to trade actively, as a 5 year strategy can be wiped in a week of trading. Your run rate is good though, and I'll hold MDR for a 30% gain if it eventuates within 6 months.",

And what the heck were they demoing in the “suite” at CES 2 or 3 years ago?   Can we assume that was a mock-up theatrical performance?  Unreal.",
"Doesn't PowerCast face the same physics as Energous? In other words, how much power needs to emit from PC's transmitter to have any reasonable amount of power received at 80 ft? The RF power level at the source must be huge and represent a much larger safety problem for PC than the safety problem for Energous. Given the physics limits of RF waves and the safety concerns, aren't Energous and PowerCast both in the same fake boat as what you describe for Energous? TIA",

"I think almost everyone following this company closely, who has an idea about what they are doing was very surprised by this FCC approval, not because the device is any kind of a technological breakthrough, but because the FCC approved a device they shouldn't have approved. Is there any precedent of the FCC approving a consumer device that radiates 10w in the RF into the open air of the room? Is there any precedent for a consumer device approved, which safety relies on a motion detector? Is there any precedent of the FCC chairman promoting a stock on his Twitter feed in what looks like a pump&dump scheme?The approved device is totally useless, but it sets a very dangerous precedent. Now there will be a race to approve ever more dangerous consumer devices. Other companies will say: if Energous can get this approved, why can't we?I hope this gets investigated fully and we find out what happened in the FCC.",

"This article makes it sound so very rosy, and it would be indeed if they would just buy one more rig and start making money. But your previous article suggest that they may pursue a roll-up strategy. Such a strategy is rife with opportunities for accounting control fraud. Roll up companies often end up as quasi ponzi schemes with numerous share based transactions, dilutive stock options given to the bought out management of the acquired companies, and endless public stock offerings. History is littered with such roll up companies, the incentive for accounting control fraud is strong for them. Because they are  attempting to buy other companies using their own equity they tend to make their financials look quite rosy and overvalue everything they can on their books. The messiness of consolidating numerous companies assets allows them great latitude in valuing assets. This is especially so when their acquisition targets are privately held and thus have no financial reports to analyze. Outsiders like myself with no special access and meager accounting skills can never truly know what roll up companies are worth. I am sure that there are some oil business professionals with extensive experience in the Midland basin who might be able analyze each transaction carefully, detect blatant accounting control fraud should it occur, and properly value the company, but that's not me. ESTE is undervalued and were it not for the risk that they may become a roll-up company I would be buying ESTE. I just don't trust any roll up company's numbers.",

"AMZN is vulnerable on many fronts.  It loses money on every retail sale.  Its miniscule profitability is solely the result of AWS, yet those margins are narrowing.  It's first mover advantage is long gone, competition is well funded and trades at real investment levels.   AMZN ""investors"" are being replaced with speculators.  A fool and his money are soon parted.  Holding AMZN at these levels is foolish.  LOL, and the TGT prattle in the media never mentions that AMZN would have to borrow $50 billion to complete such a sale.  Too funny.  So much desperation on the part of AMZN speculators.",
"I love the mobile app, order everything I can on Amazon with my prime membership. Amazon won me way back in college when to textbooks were ridiculously overpriced and many I could get on Amazon for 20% or less.",
"How does Amazon make money off of the products sold on its site? Does it get a small percentage of the sales price? Who sets the price--Amazon or the product maker? Is it the same price, often, that would be on the product maker's (or third-party retailer's) own site?",
"I am really surprised AMZN stock has not been hit from the INTC mess up.  Suddenly getting a material increase in cost in your cloud is a pretty big deal.It is not clear if AMZN will be able to recoup the cost from INTC.But it is a short term thing as it will pass.  If I had to guess I suspect INTC will replace the chips over a period of time with zero margins.This entire affair is looking like it might be the biggest digital mess we ever had.   Making such massive changes  to the Linux and Windows kernel in such a short period of time is likely to cause collateral damage.Plus services also being 30% slower will cause things to get out of whack for enterprise where they have very little elastic infrastructure to deal with it.   Google, Amazon and FB infrastructure is very elastic and knows to automatically just spin up additional resources.I am going to be curious to see how all this plays out.The other thing I just do not get is why the financial community is so disconnected by the tech community?We have been hearing murmurs about this now for 2 months as the massive changes are done on the Linux kernel.   We saw the comments redacted and knew at this point this was huge.  We could see the Linux kernel changes and knew that Intel could not fix it.Why on earth has INTC and AMZN to a smaller extent not been hit?BTW, it is a short term thing so if you really believe in any of these companies long term it could create a buying opportunity once they are hit.  Usually things like this hit more than they should.",

"My experience with mobile APP has been fantastic. For me if there is any drawback for mobile, it's that I can't see as many items at once, very understandable since I have a small phone. I'm sure AMZN will improve mobile experience by 2021.",
Friend just show me how to download and use Amazon app over this holiday. I scan bar code of SEARS kitchen hood filter. It pop up filter and price. I order it right away. Take less than minutes. Next few days filter is here. SEARS lose out. I now use it for more products when I need. I never thought it was  that easy. I even scan product that have no bar code. It come out similar product. What a great idea.,
Don't see why people say the mobile app it's hard to use. It isn't. It's not the personal computer app or a large screen. But what do you expect?,
The AMZN mobile app is all I have ever used. Easy.,
"Good job. In my last comment on Amazon, I addressed specifically this point: the contraction from 55% to 49% for online first product search on Amazon and the role of mobile commerce, along with the best capacity to convert searchers into buyers. While the contraction is a problem for Amazon, the positive factors is that the mentioned moat should allow the company to grow market share from the ad business.",

Money is spent very bad in buybacks at this astronomical p/e and the company is in no growth mode. If the company was aligned with all shareholders the money would be better spent in acquisitions. This is a shame and is impossible to invest now in ko. An alternative growing at 100% y/y is fevertree instead of drip dividends in a static company. Only my 2 cents,
Stock buybacks do not enhance value.  They just manipulate earning per share.,

"It seems Marc Davis is not seeing the whole Namaste picture. He fails to address that the valuation is not exclusively for vape pens themselves, but rather for the platform through which the pens are globally distributed, along with potentially everything else cannabis related. Supply concerns could be a temporary issue for some, but not for a company that is dominating a space that cannot keep up with demand. This is a nice problem to have and one that will be quickly solved as cultivators continue to ramp. I do not see Namaste as a vaping company anymore, but rather a cannabis tech company that also sells vape pens. I am guessing Mark will write a new article in six months with breaking news that Namaste has diversified away from vape pens.

"Ted, I have listened very closely to your  ""buy on mystery, sell on history."" advice in letting go of my stocks by April, May, or June of 2018. My question is this ...I have a small portfolio of 8 basic stocks for the Canadian Cannabis Market: Aphria, Canopy, Cronos, Emerald, Lexaria Bioscience, Namaste, Phivida, and Radient Technologies.Are there any in this group that you could see holding through a longer period, or is the idea to sell all in May or June and then wait with that cash until August to buy again?What would you do if you were holding these 8 stocks?....As always ""thank you"" for being there for us and God Bless the work you do ( the long hours doing what you love to do) that we never see!......WFIM",
"HI Ted, what do you think will happen if Aurora is NOT successful in acquiring Cannimed? Will Aurora stock price take a hit?",
Ted any thoughts on Citron reasoning behind such a bearish outlook on Aurora?,
this return to the past in policy matters concerning cannabis ignores the opiod problem,
"I am expecting a lot more volatility in 2018. One comment or action from Little Jeff can send pot stocks tumbling and it did. Having dry powder on hand will come in very handy in dealing with these sudden drops. I added some discounted TED stocks today: Radient, Lexaria, and Namaste.",
My thoughts exactly.  Except I think the downtrend on this will last for the medium term (in MJ stock terms I would call it 2-4 weeks).  Remember the reason Canadian MJ stocks command such a high multiple is our potential for export to larger future markets.,
"The news from Sessions today shouldn’t have an impact on Canadian Stocks right? I’m assuming people are overreacting, following the herd mentality. If anything, this should’ve created a buying opportunity. Am I wrong here? Thoughts from Ted or anyone else?",
boo!!! stocks today,
Thank you Ted!,
Great article Ted. You always have valuable insights.Would you be able to share your thoughts on Invictus MD?,
Does anyone know what companies in Canada are tasked with labatory testing of the product before it allowed to be sold. ? Separate from the LP. Licensed Producer..,
"Thanks for the coverage Ted. It has indeed been a wild ride and prices have gone up much faster than I expected but I'm still optimistic, while I certainly agree it is unwise to chase!",
I appreciate all the effort you put in this Ted!  I know it's difficult to find the time to get to all the questions but I am really fascinated by the technology side of the cannabis market. Science is quickly catching up with legalization.  Companies like MYDX are partnering with the tech industry and Genetic researchers to help consumers correlate the chemical profile of cannabis with how it makes them feel and which ailments it alleviates for their particular genetic make up.  Are there Canadian companies working on this sort of thing and if so who are they?  Thanks!,
Ted can i ask your opinion        CRONOS GROUP?  $PRMCF  Thank you,
"Thanks Ted, I always  look forward to your articles and I love your advice about buying on mystery and selling on news. Now on Lxrp. / Lxx , would you recommend holding for a year or two for a possible merger or buyout. or sell before MJ legalization and rebuy after consolidation. Bought in at .40 cents thanks to you. Or just keep my head up and figure it out as we go ? Thanks again, for the insights and of course watching my accounts grow.",
"roman chuyan ""Brightfield Group, a cannabis market research firm, estimates total legal sales to be $7 billion in the U.S. and about $600 million in Canada. This is critical to gage value: $600 million in total sales, $16B market cap in Canada. $7B in U.S. sales, and the total market cap of U.S.-listed cannabis stocks is only about $1.3B. So, Canada's cannabis market cap is about 12x of U.S., with only 1/10 in sales - an amazingly large discrepancy""",
Hi Ted. Why did you mention that you thought it would be prudent to be selling rather than buying on legalization day?,
Hi Ted.  Keep up the good work. Wanted to know what will happen with the cannimed and aurora deal if come March aurora is trading at 15 and cannimed is over the capped price of 24? Will less shares of aurora be given for each share of cannimed?  Thanks,
"Thanks so much for a great article, Ted! I just stumbled in here and this is the first of yours I've read. I'll be following you and reading your previous articles, too.",

As the individual stocks in my Marijuana portfolio have been getting higher and higher   (Pun Intended)......  I've been slowly topping some of those gains, but rolling the profits into  MJX, (the U.S. etf),  and HMLSF (the Canadian ETF). Trying to mitigate some of the risk.     I'm curious if you, or other commenters have any thoughts of where the better opportunity may be,   U.S. or Canada?   As my User I.D. would suggest,  I'm from Mass., which recently legalized.  I feel there is a Huge opportunity in the U.S.",
Thank you for thoughtful analysis,
"Thanks for the great article, Ted.  I've followed some of your advice, and have seen some real nice gains!  Do you follow any US cannabis stocks?  If so, do you have any recommendations?  If not, do you plan to look into any?  Thanks!",
congrats on being on 3ci committee,
"Ted,I just finished reading through the press release from CanniMed to its shareholders regarding the attempted Aurora acquisition. As one would expect, the tone of the release is extremely anti-Aurora / anti-acquisition, with heavy sentiment for CanniMed shareholders to green light the CanniMed/Newstrike deal. All of this taken with a large grain of salt, there is a point within the release that speaks to Aurora ""Four insiders, including the CEO, dumped over $17.8 million in Aurora shares just one day before the share price fell over 14%, after they made the offer to CanniMed.""As a shareholder in Aurora, I must admit I find this alarming, as I've always viewed this kind of insider activity to be a huge red flag (as well as a bit embarrassing as this is the first time I heard this). My confidence in Aurora isn't wavering, yet, but I'd like to know your personal thoughts on the Aurora/CanniMed saga.",

"the 411 of cannabis, thanks",
"Great work as usual. However my slip is showing... Everyone declares the leaders in the field are overvalued but they continue to grow? We all struggled volatile issues last year but road it out and here we are. Now other than people taking profits just for the sake of adding money in their account what would cause a major correction in the coming months. The major players have invested, acquisitions were made, growing space is on line, foreign connections are moving along, where is the fly in the ointment? In my simple mindset I see where sometime in the future some strategy adjustment will be needed but for now why get strung out. I have every stock you mentioned and trimmed to these positions and can't see where they are going down anytime soon. This has been a fun ride with 3 times the amount on the books from what I invested thanks to you but what am I missing????",
"December 18, 2018, Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) signed the Marijuana Justice Act of 2017 ...is this in the future?   copied that from last section of your news letter. I was asking because of the 2018 reference",

"Aurora Cannabis Calls for Additional Disclosure from CanniMed on ""Bizarre"" Newstrike Supply AgreementCNW GroupJanuary 3, 2018TSX: ACBEDMONTON , Jan. 3, 2018 /CNW/ - Aurora Cannabis Inc. (""Aurora"") (ACB.TO) (ACBFF) ( Frankfurt : 21P; WKN: A1C4WM) today called for additional disclosure on yesterday's wholly inadequate announcement by CanniMed Therapeutics Inc. (""CanniMed"") of a supply agreement (the ""Supply Agreement"") with Up Cannabis Inc. (""UCI""), a subsidiary of Newstrike Resources Ltd (""Newstrike""), CanniMed's proposed acquisition candidate.The timing of the Supply Agreement suggests no strategic rationale,  and raises serious questions about the apparent ongoing failure of CanniMed's management and Board to meet their fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders, in view of the superior offer from Aurora  (the ""Offer"") (described below) to CanniMed shareholders.""Simply put, this is a bizarre action by CanniMed management,"" said Cam Battley , Executive Vice President of Aurora. ""Why would CanniMed sign a supply agreement with a company they have proposed to acquire in three weeks? Why would they sign a supply agreement with a company that doesn't have a sales license, and therefore has no ability to fulfill the agreement? If CanniMed needed to purchase wholesale product, they could easily have signed a supply agreement with any number of producers currently licensed to sell. CanniMed has never previously entered into a wholesale supply agreement, nor ever indicated that they needed additional supply. So it's reasonable to ask whether their announcement actually meets the definition of a supply agreement as commonly understood – or whether it represents a disguised scheme to achieve other objectives. It's clear based on publicly disclosed information that Newstrike is in urgent financial need. Is this an attempt to transfer CanniMed capital sufficient to keep the lights on and the doors open at Newstrike? Alternatively, is this an attempt to entrench a relationship between CanniMed and Newstrike under adverse terms that are counter to the interests of CanniMed shareholders, as the latest attempt at creating a poison pill? Given that CanniMed shareholders are due to decide in the next few weeks on both the proposed CanniMed-Newstrike transaction and the Aurora Offer to acquire CanniMed, Aurora believes it is incumbent on CanniMed management to disclose the terms of the supply agreement they have signed with Newstrike's Up Cannabis subsidiary.""",
"Hi Ted,Thanks for a great article!But I have a bone to pick.I think you are a bit harsh on NXTTF, which I bought on your recommendation about 7-8 months ago.Now the stock is trying to catch up with other big LPs, and matching ACB and other, with Revenue, but lagging big time in market cap.It deserves to go up like them, should be at at least $7-8 /sh in my mind .Why do you sound so cautious ?Thanks again,",
Can you shed some light on the pending m&a between Aurora and CanniMed,
"Thank you very much for your thoughts Ted. I would like to hear some thoughts about Emblem Corp as well. They obtained the oil license recently and seem to be quite solid, trading for a fairly low price. Also they werent part of the latest rally,   so is there a lot of potential? Regards,Julius",
Hi Ted and thanks for the great work you're doing with your articles and newsletters.  Quick question - what do you think the impact on this sector will be once the retail and usual institutional investors jump on board?  Surely from the institutional side they must be banging their heads against the wall while they sit on the sidelines looking at the year-end gains in 2017 and the rocket start thus far in 2018.,
Ted your awesome,
what kind of Spike will we see in canopy growth if the Canadian government makes it legal this summer for the entire country,
"Thank you for your insightful, calm and precise advice, Ted. Using your recommendations, I was able to get into Lexaria and Namaste early on. I sold a part of my Namaste holdings yesterday in order to diversify further in this market. I hold a fair amount of these stocks in my TFSA (Canadian Tax-Free Savings Account), which is a great way to participate in this market though only for long-time holders of  investments.  I don't know if US persons are able to hold them in their Roth IRAs, but worth investigating for the future consideration of a secure retirement.",
Thank you Ted. A very comprehensive review. Obviously you've spent a fair amount of time on this. My question is what happened on December 29?  Why was there a steep drop in prices all across the board for cannabis stocks then there was a rebound towards the end of the day.,
"I should offer a service where I show up at your house to shout at you and berate you if you're investing in penny stocks with a marijuana angle that have market caps of:-$6 billion for Canopy Growth-$5.5 billion for Aurora Cannabis-$3 billion for Aphria  (all figures in Cdn dollars for these Canadian companies)Or maybe you're buying MedReleaf that was up a mere 27% just yesterday?I have a quote for you guys:""The company with the most success will be the one with the lowest production costs. They will be able to drive margins that high cost competitors cannot match.""  -David Butler (seeking alpha contributor, in his article on  aphria).Guys, there's a single... JUST ONE  Quebec based company that's licensed to sell in Quebec (where one quarter of Canada's population resides). Are you going to try to pick winners among the dozens of Ontario marijuana stocks or the dozens of BC stocks? There's just one stock/company that is about to make Quebec its fiefdom and move on to dominate from there. To make things even easier for this company, Quebec has the lowest electricity rates in Canada (imagine producing candy in a jurisdiction that has ridiculously low sugar costs).The only Quebec based marijuana stock is called The Hydropothecary Corporation . It trades under the symbol  THCX.v in Canada on the venture exchange with a market cap of about half a billion. It trades in the USA over the counter under the symbol HYYDF (although volume may be really low).This company has MASSIVE expansion plans in place for 2018, has gotten their cost of producution down to $0.89 per gram (thanks to ridiculously low electricity rates in Quebec) and to make matters more interesting:  A member of the board of directors of Alimentation Couche Tard (one of the largest convenience store chains on the planet with over 120,000 employees and 12,000 convenience stores worldwide) has just taken her place on the board of directors of...you guessed it... The Hydropothecary Corporation. Perhaps this Quebec based convenience store colossus dreams of the day when they can sell Quebec marijuana in some of their 12,000 convenience stores across the world.",
Thanks for great article! Can u pls share u thoughts about Cronos?,
Great article Ted. What are your thoughts on MedReleaf and their genetic DNA test called ReleafDx ? I bought the stock last week knowing the test was going to be avail Jan. 2018. How revolutionary do you see this being to the medical marijuana industry?,

"Thanks again for the update Ted, I've done quite well reading your articles my worst performer is up 42%. Can't thank you enough!",
"Ted, it is interesting you have no positions, especially stating that portfolio's with MJ will outperform those without.  Get on board brother, no time like now!",
"As usual, great update Ted! Recently jumped in to investing in this and I am very pleased with the short term gains!I did subscribe to your newsletter but didn't find anything in my inbox or SPAM folder. Would really appreciate receiving this!Cheers!",
"researching the January effect and how it might play into the momentum this sector is currently running with.  You say this could run for another 2-4 weeks and continue to be top 3 rally’s, which would be nice.  Investing in small caps you never know how low they will correct but also don’t want to take profits off the table.  How ever a prudent investor as I’m learning focuses on capital preservation and risk analysis -  not so much potential profits.  I suppose I feel comfortable letting it ride, hopefully into February.  I would hate to watch profits sore without me and stop losses trigger 2 months worth of gains in a matter of minutes.",

"Useless article and total waste of time. Rinse, repeat. Another recycled theory. The 7 $ price target has been bandied around by all these so called biotech gurus here.",
"This is one trick of pony. I myself is a long since 2014 and to be honest, the BO crap has been ongoing since 2014 and nothing happens. It would have happen during the time where they announced positive P3 CIC part 2 studies. But it didn't. I am sure there will be offers at that time but Gary wanted to GIA and the message he sent is clear. Dilution and dilution, even with the means of bringing the company and his shareholders down to keep his fat salary. Clearly they adopt the strategy approach of ""lets wait and see if the sales are good, if its not, lets just sell the company at any price"". Interestingly, the sales RX script were not impressive. 100+ per weekly scripts is not helping the company to survive. These monkeys knows it and they know they screw up on the loan deal. Now that Gary passed the baton to Troy, this is just sound to me that Gary wanted to re-direct the attention to Troy should anything screw up. The point is this Gary who once said in a interview in 2012 that they will explore M&A deals and partnership were just BS and as a shareholder, I feel I am being betrayed despite the fact that he did see through the drug to commercial stage.With company facing cash issue, that said, I would not rule out the BO possibility but I am afraid it might turn out a low ball offer that the management has no choice but to accept. I really hope they will ramp up sales quickly as Linzess but in order to so, they need $$$ to compete with Linzess. We as shareholders are being cornered regardless and that is the sad thing.",

Repatriation $ hopefully helps BP go shopping,
"All grand ideas but my worry aren't the 2nd tranche it's the 3rd one. I don't see them hitting the market cap requirements, so dilution is the biggest fear right now. The company needs to calm investor fears and be transparent. Reality is they have been dodgy at best. Their CC have been rainbows and lollipops, but the reality they miss forecast on nearly everything. The other hard reality is short interest is very high. The street is betting on a fire sale. I hope you're right we do see a buyout. The major positive is that it is the best drug in class and they have a pipeline and research the competition would like. Last year we saw a lot of buyouts around this time. Hopefully, we will see after approval. I'm Long/but I'm swing trading at these levels.",
Not more shares should read NOW more shares,
"Why does everyone think they'll dilute again? I for one don't think they will. After the last dilution debacle I think they realized what had happened and quickly put cost controls into place to make sure they can receive the second financing tranche without having to issue shares to meet the capital requirements. If this scenario plays out, and they don't dilute, they'll have enough cash to last another 2 quarters and thus plenty of time for a buyout. I also think after the Jan 24th PDUFA and the second tranche WITHOUT DILUTION the stock will be around $3.50 ish and thus ripe for a 100% buyout around $7.00 per share. Just my two cents.",
"SGYP has no money to launch Trulance after the Jan 24th approval so it will remain ""on the shelf"" waiting for another company or partner to take it to market. The real unknown which is infrequently mentioned in articles is what the strategy is for ROW. This remains a real opportunity to catalyzed stock price movement. The number of BO articles claiming a unique view has become a very tired argument. We need to see something from the new CEO to understand where we are going",
"Why would big pharma come in now and bid for SGYP when they have a cash issue? Just wait for another dilution. It will crash the stock 25%+. Then someone can come in and bid $1B for the Company and pay a ""~100% premium"" on a $450mm market cap after the dilution.",
I'm still even right here whatever is good,
Why would they change leadership if they were looking for a buyer?   Companies looking to be bought don’t start shifting management and incurring new costs.  They grind their current course til a transaction is complete.,
