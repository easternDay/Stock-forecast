"You are using a NN Taleb title for this piece, but I wonder whether another Taleb title - Fooled by Random - might offer a cautionary tale.First your graphs on CEO and Chair ownership may be dominated by outliers. (and lots of non-data over most of the scale)Second if I look at the performance of Swire Pacific, CK Hutchison, CK Assets over the last few years, even BRK from 1998 - 2008 (down about 40%), Wilmar, Roche, Pargesa, Swatch, Richemont, Glencore, Facebook, almost all companies involved in shipping...(all non stellar to put it mildly though controlled or at least significantly owned by families)I would caution against basing investment bets on one factor such as ownership structure.Third there are clear negative examples such as Yamana Gold (abysmal performance, disinterested management), but that is in an industry that did not deliver for quite a while (due to non-cooperative gold pricing and the consequences of mal-investment) and Yamana may well benefit over proportionally from a gold price rally (should that ever occur, as it might because almost everyone has given up it)Fourth even if signiificantly management owned firms such as Glencore seem to do everything they control about right they are hostage to politics / extortion and price-action is not favorable over a year or so and very volatile beyond so as to remind us of Mr. Buffet's saying that the industry will keep its reputation should a star management should be in a tough industry..Fifth the family owners need not remain entrepreneurial (look at Roche)Sixth whoever runs the firm has no crystal ball -- and the curveballs are coming hard and fast after the economic planners @ Fed & co dropped the ballSeventh look at the share / holding structure -- can you vote with the owners or do they own you via special share classes, nested holding structures (look at Pargesa, Roche, Sika -- the latter being an example for the insiders to cash out and throwing the limited or non-voting share owners under the bus.That said - I do appreciate your work for instance the latest pack of pieces on Gold. It appears well researched and 'factful' (if that is a word) and may well be on the money.Also I do not reject the thesis in general as my portfolio shows - I am or was invested in most of the   companies quoted above. Just do look way beyond one factor...RegardsNIcklaas",

How's that short feeling today? Too much institutional support. Good luck.,
Michael did you see Deutsche Bank cut CNHI to a sell price target $8..,
Michael does Deere have used equipment in their credit corp inventory? Also in your opinion why has CNH been so weak.,
"Although I don't think DE is an easy short, this excerpt illustrates that this author is the best on SA currently covering industrial stocks.This is the first write up I have ever seen on SA that gets the Bob Lane/SVA factor pretty much exactly correct.  Over the past 15 years they have squeezed almost all of the capital and variable expense out of their financial statements and onto those of their dealers and suppliers.  That approach, while a brilliant move at the time, has pretty much reached the end of the road for incremental benefit.  (Written as a former supplier to DE during the 1998-2005 transition period.  When they called us into a meeting to explain what SVA was in I believe 2001 I almost had a stroke.)Tough short but one with tremendous potential.  Personally I would play it through the purchase of put spreads maybe 15% out of the money partially financed by calls 15% out of the money.",
"The author is right on all of this and its a good SA article, a true rarity these days. I believe we are ultra late cycle, not mid cycle, so I think the stock is even more expensive than the author. Whats keeps ot stubbornly high on a PE basis is the same thing that keeps overvalued bluechips like MCD PG and MMM high.... generous dividends. This phenomenon is the market correction’s next victim. They started the past two weeks in the overlevered yet high yielding towers (AMT, CCI and SBAC). They’ll come around soon for DE and the rest.",
"The big macro risk for the company is they are producers who have a lending side.  This is a double jeopardy kind of thing.  A lot of new and expensive equipment has been bought in the last decade.  When a piece of equipment is bought it is financed often through Deere Credit.  This leaves them still with it on their books, many pieces can run near  a million dollars.  If the farm economy/ commodities continue to underperform, and the farmer can’t make his payments or lease, then it goes back to JD.  They usually send it to auction.  In a depressed market it may only bring 25% of its book value.  If we have a recession, this stock going back to $50.  If not probably still only worth $100.",
The bigger picture reading this article and taking into account Apple's very bad but not unexpected news this evening.Cash is king in 2019.It has taken too long for wall street to recognize just how reckless this trade war has become..... those who theorized at the beginning of the trade war that when considering the GDP of the US and China the tariffs were immaterial were so very wrong.Trade wars have a lot of messiness that spills over everywhere.  And history will most likely reflect this trade war has done more damage to the farm sector in the US that will take years and years to recover from and it will also in reflection recognize the recklessness of using American farmers as a foil against technology transfer policies..... tech companies have a lot more wealth than farmers and it would have been better to use tech against tech with respect for this trade war.,
"I agree with analysis. Farming income is low. Deere shares have been unexplainably high.I own a 200 acre farm in norhtern Illinois. Land value is good, but income off land is low.",
Your articles have been selling DE since 6/2015.  Explain the increased stock value from 2015 to 12/2018.,
Yeah DE seems fully marked.  Any thoughts on Agco?,
interesting,
"Michael,Another well-written piece, I agree. Equipment affordability is weak and sales are being front loaded with their financing arm. Could be approaching peak revenue within the next year. Tons of operating and financial leverage will clobber earnings/cash flow. Looks like a good contrarian short, or at least a portfolio hedge. One risk however is that the government is providing relatively more subsidizing to farmers, so that may cushion farm credit. On the other hand, rising rates are challenging the marginal guys.",
"Interesting, except you forgot Deere is a seller in global markets, not just the United States.",
@Michael Boyd What is your call LNN which will report earning next week?.,
I totally agree with your analysis. Those shorting Deere will be badly burned. My brother works for Deere. Their cost discipline during the lean years was absolutely exemplary. They have managed to drive costs down while continuing to invest in R&D to cement their quality lead well into the future. The Wirtgen acquisition (the shorter misspelled) is accretive to company margins is an exceptional aquisition that offers a dealer network for Deere to sell it's construction equipment by penetrating new markets. Shorters beware!,
"Excellent work, thanks.",
"""I am/we are short DE.""  The shorts have sometimes been burned on Deere and I don't see much change going forward.  Some of the arguments (where we are in the crop cycle) used above were used by a short that appeared to get burned.  I am shedding crocodile tears.  M* has DE at 92% of FMV.  Value Line estimates 9-14% annual total returns for 3-5 years from a price of $145 and rates DE as a 1 in risk (lowest risk category).  Growth components include a transformation of the business model (to includes things like software subscription revenue) and ongoing integration of Wirtgen.  At this point in time, I will hold DE and certainly see no good reason to sell.  Regarding shorting - there are much better candidates than a rock solid company that is modestly undervalued.

"Tetraphase Pharma stock price target slashed to $4 vs. $10 at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey5/10/19 7:54 AM ET (MarketWatch)Heh, $4 a share.  Would be nice.Guy Macdonald, President and CEO of Tetraphase, “We are especially pleased that XERAVA has been added to more than 200 formularies at top-prescribing hospitals, including some large integrated delivery networks, and we are on track to complete 400 formulary reviews by mid-year.”ir.tphase.com/...",
"For what it's worth, we estimate Q1 Xerava sales at just under $500k.  That's good growth over Q4 even after adjusting for 9 weeks in Q4 versus 13 weeks in Q1.  Final 4 weeks of Q1 were up about 130% from 4 weeks before Christmas.  Assuming we have a traditional adoption curve, there's no sign as of yet that Xerava has reached the take-off point at the bend in the s-curve.  If our sales estimate holds up it will probably disappoint at least some of the analysts.  That said, it's hard to believe the stock has much room to go down.  On the positive side, if Xerava were to continue to grow by over 100% per quarter, that alone is the basis for a substantial run-up in the stock price over the next year or so.  Such continued growth would substantially reduce dilution fears.  We continue to view TTPH as an interesting asymmetric opportunity, the next few quarters should tell the tale.",
"I admit, I have not read everything here (article + comments) and am only now researching this.. but I am curious, how big or narrow is the market for cIAIs? Is that the only indication for Xerava?",
"Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals Presents Preclinical Data on TP-2846, a Novel Drug Candidate for Acute Myeloid Leukemiaseekingalpha.com/...",
"Some analysts are as high as $800k, which I believe TTPH will miss.  Revenue very likely in the $350k-$500k range in Q1.  That comes from 9 weeks of sales in the fourth quarter and 13 weeks in the first plus something over 50% sales growth based on last 9 weeks of 2018 versus first 9 weeks of 2019.",
so. what is projected revenue of 2019 1st que?,
"TTPH just crossed over the 50 MA, and seems to be showing a little strength on down days.  Bottom in?  Something afoot?",
Why has this been going in the opposite direction of the market on no news these past 2 weeks? Anyone have any clue what's going on?,
"Key for TTPH will be : 1) Marketing people cannot cost too much V.S the revenues they are generating. 2) Continu doing their FANTASTIC job of keeping cost low. (look at AKAO, PRTK or MLNT huge COST) What is positive for TTPH: The sell price is low (175$) If you charge a lot for new anti biotic like MLN, AKAO or PRTK your drug is held in reserve for only specialized use so total market is small....Also, look at balance sheet for MLNT , huge debt + they did a r/s that never helps. I think that Guy Macdonald and Larry are 2 smart Business people. They have been in the business for a while. From August 2003 until January 2008, Mr. Macdonald served as Executive Vice President, Operations, at Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Prior to joining Idenix, he served in various positions at Merck & Co., Inc., from 1981 to 2003, including Vice President for Anti-Infective and Hospital Products. rior to joining Tetraphase, Mr. Edwards served as Senior Director of Marketing, Gram-negative Franchise, with Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., from April 2014 to July 2015 (Cubist acquired by Merck & Co., Inc.). From 2010 to 2014, he served as Global Marketing Director, Clostridium difficile and New Infectious Disease Products, with Merck & Co., Inc., where he also served as Associate Director of Vaccines and Infectious Diseases from 2007 to 2010, and held various management training and sales positions of increasing responsibility from 1999 to 2007. TETRAPHASE has all the ingredients to become a very successful business if they continue doing their great job on keeping their BALANCE SHEET healthy as it is.",
"A good example is Melinta Therapeutics (former known as Cempra). Look at the sales data,every quarter and compare with spendings.",
Does anyone have or know where to find the sales data from prior new antibiotic launches?  It would be useful to learn how long it took for the adoption curve to accelerate.,
"NOTE: Governments and outside organizations have tried to convince pharma companies to keep their antibiotic research programs going through generous subsidies and funding investments in recent years..In the meantime, bacteria are simply winning the arms race, outpacing the development of new drugs and programs designed to combat resistance. This year alone, there were three cases of gonorrhea found to be completely untreatable through standard medication. Similar cases involving different bugs will inevitably come.Already, superbugs are responsible for 700,000 deaths a year worldwide. But by 2050, barring any last-minute miracle, they could kill an estimated 10 million people annually—a death toll higher than all cancers combined.",
"Frighteningly, we're just a pandemic away from renewed interest in antibiotics.  A viral outbreak resulting in swaths of death from bacterial pneumonia was last seen 100 years ago.   We're due.",
"By year 2024 the market projection for antibiotics is $60 Billion. Current macrolides are becoming ineffective, as resistance is increasing; with resistance becoming striking in Asia (+70%) and USA (+49%), making clear the need for new antibiotics. So, there is no issue of the market need and it then comes to a matter of how to price the drugs",
"There is no way in hell all companies will stop to do ANTIBIOTICS of else Millions Millions of people will die IMO There are a few potential catalysts that might propel these Antibiotic cie biotechs to higher valuations:A takeover at a decent valuation in the space.An international partnership with decent conditions for one of the pack.A U.S. sales partnership with a large pharmaceutical company and decent conditions for one of the pack.A takeover would hit the market as a total surprise, while any sales partnership would be seen as a double-edged sword: On the one hand, it would confirm the drug's value, but on the other hand it would mean that an outright sale of the company is unlikely. So the market reaction would certainly depend on the precise terms of the partnership. Given the absurdly low valuations, any decent upfront payment would likely provide a boost.Another possibility is consolidation. If two or more of these companies decided to merge and to build only one common sales organization, the synergies would be enormous.",

"GREAT ARTICLE By: Joel Sendek  As an analyst earlier in my career, one of the first stocks I ever placed a Buy rating on had the following characteristics:  All the other analysts gave it a Hold rating, and it was one of the only players attempting to launch a novel product in a genericized market that most big pharmaceutical companies already abandoned.  Does that sound familiar?The antibiotics subsector within biotech has faced recent headwinds.  Negative events at specific companies have driven some of this trend, including clinical setbacks, regulatory delays, challenging launches, and company downsizing among public companies in the sector.   As a result, the stock price performance and corresponding market capitalization of the overall subsector have suffered.  Furthermore, there have been multiple announcements of large companies exiting the space or divesting their anti-infective development programs (Novartis, Allergan, Sanofi, The Medicines Company and AstraZeneca).  Given this backdrop, why would any reasonable investor continue to deploy capital in the space?  There are many factors for investors to consider, as outlined below.1. Fundamental unmet need exists due to continued growth in resistance to current therapies and limited pipeline innovation.  While some investors may argue that antibiotic drug launches are too slow, one thing is clear:  the next-generation drugs are expected to find demand as resistance reduces the potency of current therapies. We detailed  in a prior post how antibiotics that treat unmet need outside the hospital are especially valuable. 2. The valuations are quite compelling on a comparative basis.  Many of these companies have late-stage products or even approved compounds with long patent life.  Given the low market caps, it does not necessarily require heroic sales and/or earnings to catalyze a turnaround of a stock with a low EV.  3. Incentives exist in the subsector that don’t exist elsewhere in biotech. ·       Public capital in the form of government grants has accelerated (BARDA, DoD, NIAID).  These programs make available significant non-dilutive capital that is largely absent in other disease areas.  ·       The regulatory environment for agents that address fundamental unmet need continues to be constructive and may support capital-efficient paths to approval.4. Investors are ignoring the space, which is perhaps the most important reason for investors to consider investing in antibiotics now. As any value investor will attest, identifying what may be a mispriced stock within an unpopular sector may be a great way to add alpha to your portfolio.In many ways, the state of the antibiotic companies in the stock market reminds me of that Buy rating I mentioned above. The stock was Genentech.  It was 1997, and no big pharma company (or many investors) thought there was any money to be made in drug therapies for cancer because all the chemotherapies were generic. I went out on a limb and printed an above-consensus $600M estimate for my peak sales for the drug Genentech planned to launch themselves as their first ever oncology product: Rituxan.",
the antibiotic market is not fancy enough for investors and TTPH is to small to compete against the giants . they might be able to push the prices higher in order to get better financing but technically I don't believe the company will succeed.,
"I think TTPH will be valuable one of these days.  That said, the management team has burned a lot of credibility with their messing up clinical trials for cUTI.  We'll see how they do with the commercial launch.  The first quarter sales look fairly slow, averaging less than $10k per week so far.  However, the weekly data available is a sample, so actual sales will be higher, and last week was the best sales week yet, so they are ramping.  I'd be very surprised if sales make $5 million in Q2 2019.  To do that weekly sales would have to be $385k per week on average.  It's a long stretch to get from $20-30k last week to over $300k over the next 15 weeks.Analysts believe TTPH will have about $1 million sales in Q4 2018.  TTPH will in all probability disappoint again with sales of significantly less than $1 million.  My question is what happens then?  Does it go down further?  Seems like Mr. Market gives this management team no credit for being able to perform.",

"Great article.I would also say it is a game which is very much about fixed costs. The cost of making the first chip is huge.AMD's brilliant Zen CPU architecture is inspired by a very lean history, as noted. Conceptually, there is just one advanced chip - yet as we see, they address the whole market, from very top datacentre behemoths to ~$50 bottom entry level with this single leggo block, arranged on a variety of simpler multi-core modules, for the sockets of three motherboard platforms for ~ desktop/workstation/server.Point being, not only do amd have a very significant manufacturing cost advantage - designed to be profitable in the humble small volumes they have been accustomed to, but they now find they are a very large volume producer as well.Everybody, and certainly intel, know very well they have no choice but start from scratch and emulate amdS modular architecture (as opposed to Intel's monolithic) to be any thing like competitive in perf/$ metrics.To airily say they can just bump R&D is rot. They have always outspent amd by a country mile, yet now look pathetic. Intel have so many problems on so many levels, including culture, their only real salvation is  evolutionary, and years from fruition, irrespective of alleged heavy R&D spending.The advanced tech used is similar. Its the assemblages of it that have gazumped Intel.Even if their 10nm had coincided with a similar amd 7nm, amd would have far better production costs - so nor is predatory pricing an Intel option.It gets worse. Intel have vast capital tied up in their own production facilities. Under utilised, they become a huge cost drag. AMD sub-contract production to the best available specialist fabricators. AMD learned that lesson very expensively years ago. In house production sounds cool, until your chips stop selling - then they become a huge drag.(Tessla are also a worry if car sales don't measure up - they better have a good backup  markets for batteries from their monster battery factories)AMD is also, counter intuitively, a safe bet against market vagaries. As discussed, AMD are the minnow in a monopolistic duopoly. It is a zero sum game. Intel's loss immediately becomes AMD's gain. Even in a lousy cpu market, amd can grow exponentially from a low base.",

Rome will not fair any better and here is why:1) Rome launches in the 2nd 1/2 of 2019 if you believe the CEO. 6-8 months later Intel will have Ice lake shipping. Intel customers will wait 6 months instead of taking on a new CPU from a unproven company. 2) They have seen Intels roadmap that includes chiplets ( not anything close to AMD's mess of a design) new 3D packaging technology where you can stack logic and a whole new architecture that will launch in 2020.3) Intel can package and bundle and customize their products. AMD has a chip. Intel has memory, photonics, 5G, ASICsYou write an article on AMD that basically states NVDA and Intel are doing nothing",
"Todays AMD IR report said the MI60 would launch Q1 2019, previously was due Q4 2018 which is slight worry as no reason for delay been given.The (unofficial) 2% Server report also a slight worry, I expect it will turn out a bit higher though may need a large sale to AWS to end 2018 in the mid to high single digits. My uneducated guess is that the big customers have been playing with EPYC as a negotiating tool with intel but will hold off large orders until Rome comes into productionI would expect AMD could do very well with mobile PCs as 7nm inherently better than Intel and performance plays a larger factor than priceAs mentioned in artilce given the fabless setup a comparison of R&D with Intel is pretty meaningless.I am long AMD ... have a few more grey hairs and find myself tensing any time I hear of an earthquake in the region.ChrisCFA, CGMA",
Commentator Wiggins' eyeballs must be rolling backwards in their sockets with this positive article and the returns for the year.  Long AMD.  Both Intel and Nvidia got caught with their pants down.  With the new class action lawsuit pending against Nvidia for defrauding their investors in regard to crypto ... it's going to get even better for AMD.,
"@The Value Portfolio While the article is well written, I find it to be completely biased.Almost every single data point you bring up, you are only presenting the positive side for AMD, and without accurate context it is extremely misleading to any investor who doesn't know this.-------------I'll bring up one example;""This change is reflected in the respective desktop CPU market shares. AMD finished 2017 with a mere 10% market share. Industry observers, extremetech.com believes that by the end of 2018, AMD's market share could reach an astounding 30%. Continued growth means that the company's CPU processor share will reach parity with Intel, a company trading at more than 10x AMD's valuation.""From your link:• Desktop as a percentage of CPU market share is about 20%www.extremetech.com/...Current market share figures (Q3-18):• AMD's current Desktop market share is about ~13% (~3% CMS*)• AMD's current Mobile / Laptop market share is about ~11% (~8% CMS*)www.reddit.com/...*Consumer Market Share = Desktop + Laptop-------------Now let's apply context...The 30% figure from Extremetech only applies to Desktop market share.Looking at AMD's YOY market share gains I believe it is unlikely that AMD will go from ~13% to ~30% during Q4-2018.Now, while AMD is gaining market share and increasing its revenues as it continues to transition to Zen based products, AMD is likely to have ~13% to ~15% of the Consumer Market Share leaving 2018.These numbers are good, but at the current rate of market share gains (2-3% CMS per year), it will take about 10 years for AMD to ""reach parity with Intel"" in the Consumer Market.",
Author forgot to mention that AMD is open source GPU compared to NVDA CUDA software.  The NVDA stock holders consider CUDA a moat.  The NVDA moat is going to coat more (to the customer) than the benefits of going with open source hardware.  On the INTC side author forgot to mention that at the INTC architects day< INTC is moving away from monolithic to chip let architecture.  AMD should have a huge lead in chip let with Infinity Fabric.  Finally one of the truly hidden gems of AMD is the coming Console upgrades.  Developing GPU for Console kept AMD from going BK leading up to the Zen Architecture and Epyc processors.  During the next 2 years Consoles could become the HIGHEST gross margin revenue generators for AMD when the next generation Consoles get released!,

Very will written and extremely informative article.,
"@The Value Investor ,""By December, this has inched up to a 2% market share, and with the 7nm EPYC expected to launch in 2019, this is expected to hit 5%.""WHAT!!!!. Just 2% market share in 2018 while Lisa Su said 5% by end of 2018. A BIG SETBACK. So AMD will hit only 5% in 2019? Not good at all. WHY IS IT MARKET SHARE IS GROWING SO SLOWLY????""In 2018, that EPS should be closer to $0.36, a doubling of the 2017 EPS.""ONLY 36c. At today's price of $18.83 it gives a P/E of 52!!!! With FED not decided what it wants to do, Mueller report coming out soon their will be P/E compression for all GROWTH STOCKS. First half of 2019 revenues will be lower than first half of 2018 revenues. This is because of loss of revenue from GPU and Consoles. This means TTM EPS will be even lower than 36c in first half of 2019. So AMD stock at most will remain sideways for the first half after getting a little bit of bump after Lisa Su's CES presentation.AMD NEEDS TO SELL MORE AND MAKE MORE AND THAT ALONE WILL HELP ITS STOCK PRICE. Holding in 2019 is fine and my guess is the stock price will remain sideways between $18 and $25 in 2019.",

"This deal could bring a lot of excitement to the industry. I wish I could afford to join in :-) However, the excitement continues tomorrow when the market opens!     Perhaps now the spotlight and pressure are on the APHA management: APHA shareholders will examine the comparison between what APHA management has accomplished and is accomplishing vs. the hypothetical proposed by the head of GGBXF. This pressure is a result of the ""hostile"" bid.     There is also talk of this being a ""publicity"" stunt or a ""bluff"". Might investors be able to call that ""bluff""? Could investors put the spotlight and pressure back on the GGBXF head by reducing their presence in GGBXF to the extent that it is reflective of the assets they actually have (the evaluation projection experts in the crowd could help with this perhaps)? And wouldn't this make more sense for some investors? IF GGBXF investors stay put, under the current configuration of the deal their shares will be significantly lessened in number, won't they; they will only own 34% of the company. If an investor has 1000 shares, for example, would the current deal reduce that to about 300 shares? Buying into GGBXF will not gain multiples will it? There will be a bounce in value if the share price pops, but with the proposed share reduction for GGBXF investors after the initial jump they might be priced out of buying back in and might not be able to leverage multiples through increasing shares a second time and might be stuck with a very reduced - share count - version of their original investment?     If there are the resources to invest, would it make sense to move nearly all of what is invested in GGBXF (except for an amount that is reflective fo their actual assets) into APHA and put the pressure back on the GGBXF head to actually be able to do this deal? Might this be calling the ""bluff""?     The GGBXF head highlighted that GGBXF got 7 licenses in NV. Is this a reflection of the NV market recognition of GGBXF potential to earn? Reducing shares in GGBXF might put only temporary pressure back on GGBXF; their bona fides are reflected, in part, by those seven licenses which are in a market making substantial gains. Did the NV give out so many licenses to GGBXF because they hope for synergistic gains if GGBXF succeeds in making a deal with the APHA shareholders?     Finally, there is talk of the GGBXF offer being an ""insult""; why would the head of GGBXF, who has an impressive track record certainly reflective of his and his team's ability and intelligence, purposefully try to ""insult"" anyone? Intelligent people don't cast off insults for no reason do they? Is it leverage or knowledge or something else?     Perhaps investors have few or no options except to wait and see :-) Good luck to all! This is very fascinating :-)",

"Yes, thank you. I am still working out the kinks with how to submit properly. Sorry about that :-)",
"This might end up being one of the most transformational deals that this developing industry will see at this juncture; I wish I could afford to be part of it :-)  There are many details and moving parts and while APHA shareholders will justifiably be patient knowing that it takes time to build an international company, I wonder if they'll wake up with at least two questions in their minds: with all of the great Canadian assets and with APHA's desire to position itself as one of the top three companies in Canada and therefore ostensibly in the world given the current jurisdictional landscape, why isn't the NYSE listing reflective of these things? In addition, why is APHA, given its aspirations and assets yet allowing for how retail can be impacted by  market pressures, still vulnerable to short attacks?  The head of GGBXF is a familiar and successful face to NYSE investors based on his and his team's success establishing two international brands and one domestic brand; when he appeared on Mad Money the host lit up like a Christmas Tree (granted he perhaps does this in response to others as well). In addition, the head of GGBXF might be able to accelerate the successful development of retail in this industry; will NYSE investors be more comfortable mitigating any  residual stigma associated with the products given a context in which companies are framed based on other bankable and successful investments in the past - suddenly cannabis will be put in a category or perhaps viewed in a way that those other brands were. Not to mention that undergarments, bathroom products, and jeans cater to what might be another demographic for the industry. Does the GGBXF know enough and can he reach these investors and these customers?  The overlap between the companies? Might this mean that they will benefit from this or does it provide enough information to buttress GGBXF's effort? We shall see. IF it is the former perhaps the deal is configured so that the GGBXF and the Canadian assets are streamlined into a formidable competitor and the somehow the LATAM and other assets are disconnected perhaps allowing for someway for APHA to mitigate the drag of these potential scandals? IF it is the latter, perhaps GGBXF is simply waiting for the details to become visible.  The head of GGBXF I think reassured the Canadian market (hopefully he will be true to his word and especially because it is necessary) by stating that first and foremost Canadian producers most satisfy their supply agreements in Canada. I wonder if APHA shareholders will like that perspective.It is fascinating to watch and I wish everyone the best of luck :-)",
Look at this another way. If Vic hadn’t spent $750M on Nuuvera and LATAM he could buy either Canntrust or Organigram at a 50% premium. Do you think Aphria stock would be at $6 then?,
"Aphria investors seem to be missing the mark here.  Aphria spent $298 million on some crappy farm assets and leased stores that are empty.  Aleafia has 38kg going to 98kg in 2019 and 22 medical clinics, and a retail subsidiary with Serruya family and is only valued at $220 million.  Would have made a lot more sense to buyout a company like Aleafia rather than these assets.  Definitely some shady business dealings here.",

"Yes, the GGB takeover in its current form ""ain't it"" - agreed. But, it has started the wheels turning in the minds of some perhaps and it might put more focus on the actual performance of management and the hypothetical of which other management teams might find a way to be more successful. On the other hand,  GGB and APHA might continue to ""do-si-do"" for a while since they are already linked.",

Agreed that the only way (if there is a way) the deal makes sense is by retaining the NYSE listing. Whether in these developmental stages of the cannabis industry such a deal could be configured is an apparent obstacle; yet all kinds of deals are being made so perhaps this one finds an iteration that works well. APHA so far has been passed over a couple of times and I wonder if a larger entity wants different management ...?,
"GGB's offer is to the shareholders: our management can maximize revenues and share price more than the current APHA management. IF revenues reports for 2019 are off or not reflective of maximizing the APHA assets and if the scandals lead to the additional and gradual damage of APHA, then perhaps the APHA shareholders will begin to want a new team to lead the way. Given their past track record, there is potential that NYSE investors will love the new management based on their solid track records in the past and, as a result, NYSE investors might give new management a long honeymoon because in their minds the results will eventually be there based on the past and the financing this group has for the long term. Also, the GGB management team brings familiar and successful faces to the Cannabis Industry which helps normalize it for the NYSE investors in part. IF the deal can be reconfigured so that the ALPH shareholders retain control (the GGB shareholders would be marginalized) completely, then the deal might make sense for maximizing revenues and share price. This deal or better iterations of it in the future, is about what the GGB management can do with the APHA assets for the shareholders based on how NYSE investors like the resumes of the GGB team. IF the GGB management is given the keys to the car (and the APHA shareholders get a better price with full control), then GGB/APHA could be a Tilray with more potential for sustainability (given that it would based on results and not stock manipulation). I have positions in neither but would buy GGB if I could budget it.",
"P Harrison and Justin Pringle have it right, the weakness in the article are its assumptions that (i) Aphria will be able to sell 250 000 kg of marijuana (its full production capacity) and (ii) that operating margins will remain at 17%.At the moment, the Canadian market is about 1 million kg, and legal production capacity is about 400 000 kg, so you would expect all companies to sell all the product they can make and get good margins. But Aphria is not the only company with big new production capacity coming online in 2019; I have seen estimates of projected capacity of 2 million kg in 2020. It os clear that some companies will have to settle for less than 100% of their production capacity, and it is quite likely that the price wars will drive margins way down, perhaps to close to zero or perhaps even below zero.With more conservative assumptions (maintaining market share, margins at half today’s levels), you get a much lower market cap, more like $1 billion ($4 a share). If you give them a P/E lower than 20, or account for the possibility of more corruption/ law suits / problems with credibility, you get a lower value.That’s not to say that the takeover offer is fair - clearly, GGP is worth almost nothing, and it’s offer, it is serious, is ludicrous. I suspect the offer was designed to prop up Aphria’s price as much as anything, with GGP’s motivation being the (small) possibility that the offer actually gets accepted, getting them Aphria’s Canadian assets for next to nothing.",

I like Aphria and am long - but  concerned about oversupply in Canada over the next couple of years. Assuming sales based on 100% full production is an overly optimistic metric I’m not willing to make - maybe 75-80%.,

"D.H. Taylor, I totally agree with you.  The hostile take-over bid is ridiculous.  Aphria state-of-the art greenhouse/production facility (phase 4) should be completed with 3 months and their state-of-the-art Double Diamond greenhouse/production facility should be completed in 6 months or so.  These two facilities are massive, I know how big they are because I use to work in the greenhouse industries in Leamington.  According to my estimate, once these two facilities are completed, the stock price should be at a bare minimum be at $11 CAD; anything below $11 CAD is a safe bet.  I bought some last month when it dips into the low $7 CAD and I am long on Aphria.",
"The offer could be a tad low...but it's a starting point. The 2 sides know each other well and what each other brings to the table. As you pointed out, we all know who backs GGB. What people overlook is that GGB is more or less the Shottensteins private vehichle into Cannabis, except it's public. They knew when this went public in Nov, this wasnt their last round of financing. They have ambitious plans for this sector and are lining up the pieces to achieve it. That financing at 7$ was prob planned with or without Aph. For a late entry into this sector, watch them catch up rather quickly. They will become a top 5, maybe even top 3 MSO. I don't see a benefit to them in paying a ton for Aph since  their makeup is quite diff and their investments are prob best served in focusing on US. But if they can get them on the cheap, why not. Imo alot of the interests in GGB, APH AND LHS are all in a familiar basket.",
If nothing else the short sellers report is wrong about Aphria being worth zero or anything close to zero. The fact they totally ignore the Canadian assets which indisputably produce cash flow highlights the short sellers deliberately incomplete assessment of Aphria.,
The LATAM affair was never put to rest but I agree Aphria should be priced at the value of the Canadian production. Nuuvera and LATAM is fuzzy at best. Both those controversies leave Aphria trading at a discount that I expect to persist at least with the current management in place.,
"Everyone really needs to stop calling this potential deal a takeover of APHA. It's not. It's an attempted forced takeover of GGP initiated by GGP.

"I bought an iPhone 8 in 2017.  It was a great buy.  Its battery runs all day, often into the next day with 50% of its capacity available.  It is fast, just the right size, and able to handle anything that the iOS software hands to it.  I use it for calls, texts, music, and email.  I have an iPhone 6s that I use overseas and it does everything that I need.So, I did not buy a new iPhone this year and bought an iPad Pro 11” instead.  I average over 8 hours of screen time a day on it.  That is more time than I use to spend on my maxed out 2017 MacBook Pro 15”.  Amazingly, the iPad Pro 11” is almost as fast as the MacBook Pro 15”.  I use it whenever I need to hand-write on any document or draw, read, or watch videos.  I suspect that I am among a billion people who are very satisfied with Apple products.  In my opinion, Tim Cook did a very smart thing when he issued the letter downgrading the guidance for Q1’19.  Apple stocks have taken such a pummeling that its value currently borders on being “silly”.  Yes, AAPL share will drop 8%, perhaps more, on that announcement.  But, the announcement lowered the expectations of investors. Most people still expected Apple to meet their original guidance.  If Apple hits $88-$92 billion with the Q1’19 report, it will have exceeded its guidance and should pop.  Apple has nothing to lose and everything to gain with such a letter.  They can buy more shares on the dip and make their EPS look even better.  In the meantime, China is in a deep funk with such strong headwinds that it is a wonder that Apple is able to sell any iPhones in the country at all.  On Wednesday January 2, 2019, the Hang Seng Index dropped over 720 points from about 25,200.  This was a 2.4% drop stemming from three events.  The first was President Xi Jinping announcing that Taiwan’s independence is not acceptable.  The second was the first decline of a key manufacturing index for the first time in years, withholding the little cover that China has for the economic damage that the US trade war has done.  The third is the drastic moves that China are making to stimulate its economy, including boosting its infrastructure spending, reduction in taxes, and increasing its support of businesses.  China’s stock markets have fallen over the past year, reflecting the 25% tariffs that have already been imposed on steel, aluminum, and many Luther Chinese goods shipped to the U.S.  In Hong Kong, New Year’s Eve was very quiet.  The streets were almost empty.  The fireworks was spectacular but the crowds were small.  A lot of people have lost money in the stock markets and reduced sales in the United States.Many people in China and Hong Kong bought Apple stock.  It was considered an invulnerable and invincible stock.  With the stock markets in China falling, many Chinese are selling their Apple stocks and waiting for the stock to bottom out before re-investing.  Of course, much bad news were hyperbolized, e.g. the Qualcomm win against in Chinese court, Apple suppliers are showing less revenues from Apple than expected, and unexpected discounts of Apple products.Apple needed to lower expectations and take a temporary hit on its stock prices so that if Apple reported $90 billion quarterly revenues, it would be regarded as a huge hit.  It was a very smart move by Tim Cook.  In the meantime, of course, Apple can accelerate its stock repurchases.

The cost of the iPhone XR in Korea INCLUDES the 10% VAT (Sales Tax equivalent) tax. You should do your research more thoroughly. Apple may have to pay export taxes to countries that doesn't have FTA with China or Taiwan (because iPhones are manufactured there) too.,
"The general market will panic tomorrow because retail investors are sheep and sheep hate to see the sheers come out, so they all run for the exits together. Apple will be fine, if people are dumb enough to spend a $1000 bucks on a phone that will become a paperweight in less than 2 years, they will keep buying anything Apple produces. Plenty of millennials and teenagers with their faces still firmly planted in their iPhones every waking moment, ready to spend an entire summers job income on a future iPhone with the inevitable dozen screen cracks.I pity our future really, the days of hard work are gone along with half the English language because someones ""wittle"" feelings get hurt.

Good article. Enjoyed the trade in analysis.,
"Apple could be a slow motion version of RIMM/BBRY, but obviously not that bad, unless they can get services (or something else) to make up for the end of the iPhone growth cycle. Their phone(s) are now priced too high given their reduced levels of advantage, I have many friends moving to phones like onePlus, Xiaomi, Haiwei etc etc that give you 90% or more of what the Apple does. It is hard to see this emerging trend getting anything but worse.RIMM had a very low PE for quite a while, tech companies with low PEs tend to suggest something is wrong as opposed to being good buying opportunities (in my anecdotal experience).",

"I think China is a convenient excuse to cover up the fact that Tim Cook and his management put out the wrong product mix.The XR should never have seen life in its current form - it appeals to those thrifty not to go for an X/XS, isn't sold at enough of a discount and is just too big for most people. Apple needed a smaller, slightly cheaper phone (i.e. iphone 8 and/or SE size) to tap into growing markets. Instead they put out products that overlap each other... It would also ensure keeping services revenue and user base growing.Quite sadly the ship has sailed for this company - yes they have good quality products but they aren't selling what most people want/need. To those who think apple can go on growing forever based on past products - you just have to draw parallels with IBM (back when they were leading the world) to see how similar they are.",

History has not been kind to companies who have this kind of mix.  They get about a decade of stellar growth and then... dead money.I don't see any innovative products on the horizon that will even remotely match the earning potential of the iPhone.

The smartphone market is mature, saturated, facing tremendous competitive pressures and declining ASPs are starting to become a very real prospect for Apple.I think Apple is appropriately valued here.

"Good article Kody,  I agree AbbVie has done a good job in trying to secure Humira sales until 2023. Yet, in addition to the political pricing risk, there is still the risk with respect to Boehringer Ingelheim  lawsuit. ""Boehringer argues that the Illinois drugmaker acted inequitably by pursuing overlapping and non-inventive patents, creating a “patent thicket” around Humira"".  According the linked article below a BI spokeswoman told FiercePharma the company's “focus is on bringing Cyltezo to the U.S. market, and we are committed to making it available to U.S. patients as soon as possible and certainly before 2023.”www.fiercepharma.com/...An argument was won in the UK High Court. Though not binding outside the UK, Justice Carr did state that ""AbbVie has a well established strategy of dragging out proceedings for long as possible, causing maximum expense and inconvenience to its opponents.""  AbbVie wanted to settle out of court Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics and Samsung Bioepsis wanted AbbVie to show all its cards and let courts decide.    www.biopharma-reporter.com/...The recent $450 million FTC anti-trust ruling against AbbVie and Besin regarding Androgel may further fuel  Boehringer Ingelheim to take the litigation to its end.  ""The Court ruled that AbbVie used ‘sham litigation’ to maintain its monopoly over Androgel. District Judge Harvey Bartle said: ‘The FTC has established the actual market reality that defendants possessed monopoly power and illegally and wilfully maintained that monopoly power through the filing of sham litigation’. He added that without AbbVie’s actions Perrigo could have released a generic version of Androgel over a year earlier, specifically, in June 2013 rather than December 2014.""www.gabionline.net/... Time will tell if Humira sales and pricing is protected until 2023.However, AbbVie's PPS will most likely reflect the uncertainty until the litigation and political pressure issues are resolved.",

I can add one comment that provides me additional confidence in my investment in Birchcliff BroEnergy.  In October 2017 the Investment Management firm Letko Brosseau purchased 5 million shares in the area of $5.70.  At the end of October 2017 they controlled over 30 million shares representing over 11% of the outstanding shares.  This required them to report their activity to SEDAR where I obtained this information.  The minimum investment in their Pooled Fund is one million dollars.  A Segregated Account is five million.

"Apple should not raise the dividend by more than 10%-12% annually until the share repurchases are complete. One of the main points of the buybacks is to lessen the float, in order to pay healthy dividends at some point in the future. If the share price is currently depressed, so be it. Apple reported a record FY quarter 4 in November, and subsequently guided to another record this quarter. If this isn’t enough, simply keep buying back shares cheap. Long term shareholders will be rewarded in the best way possible, following that scenario.",
"iPhones are not overpriced. The level of technology designed and built into them match the price tag.

This year may prove to be another “tough comparison” on overall iPhone sales similar to the release of the 6S, after popular 6, causing headwinds for the stock short term, but their products, services and ecosystem are the strongest they’ve ever been, when their direct competitors are finding it prohibitively expensive to try and keep up, with their commoditized segment of the market.Raising dividends in light of short term stock headwinds makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

I know the profit on the Watch pales by comparison to the phone, but the product ought to drive more traffic to the Apple Store and further cement customers to the Apple ecosystem for add-on products and more phones.

"Its pretty obvious Todd has been dead wrong on this....but its still your own fault if you have blindly followed him. Every single article he has written has been responded to with excellent comments basically rebuffing all of his bullish assumptions. That said, I'm going to continue watching this name. I think there is a good chance this will go a whole lot lower from here as the entire shareholder base needs to turnover at this point. All the current investors who were in it for income will basically look to exit at this point and take their tax loss. At some point, long term value investors will replace them...but who knows at what level. There might be another trade at some point here in 2019.",
"Todd may or may not be conflicted but honestly, we use him as a data point.  We are ourselves responsible for our choices with HCLP and the management team is responsible for deluding us.They raise capital, they pay themselves and the GP.  I wonder if there is a conflict of interest with the capital expansion - in that someone near and dear is being paid off to build something that is not needed.  It seems insane that they are expanding capacity when sand capacity and volume could be had at a very low price to generate the $10 contribution they are seeking.Finally after all this debt raise and spending, they shaft the shareholders.  Who will buy this even as a C-corp?  This is among my top 5 investing mistakes and yes, Todd's credibility is in question.",

Either they pay the distribution which they can do out of Cash Or they buy the  stock at ridiculously cheap levels. Either way the stock should get a pop in two weeks I’m a buyer at this level,
"@1luckyschmucky - Yup, I can see those several reasons for the jump - I was hoping it is M&A.  I believe there will be M&A but HCLP will not get the ROIC in a deal today.I strongly believe that HCLP should not be expanding capacity but working to take the excess out.  How about being the exclusive logistical partner to one of the 7 other sand plants near its Kermit location in a profit share deal instead of expanding Kermit?  Same for Wyeville.  In fact now is the time for buybacks with that cash hoard = at least 1/2 of year end market cap, no?With 3-4 MM tons per quarter, and a $10 contribution margin (taking us back to mid 2017), they will make $35 MM, of which $16 MM is SGA and $8 MM is interest.  They will make 10 cents a share and pay out 23 cents?  If all cash is spent on expansions, they will be in a soup if this downturn continues.  Macro picture for oil does not seem good unless Trump starts a war..... They do not seem focused on the cash they have raised, which is a huge advantage in the downturn and in war of attrition. Just saying........  As a stockholder, I am stuck for the long haul, have lost faith in the management team for now, and am living on hope and a prayer and good words from all my peers here on this chat! GL for 2019 ya'll.",
The problem with this author's thesis that if sand prices do not recover they can go to a fee based model....... the exact same thing is being said about Apple but the core of Apple and HCLP is sales of their product; not fees.Wall Street does not buy into these changes from product sales to fee based when they see how much capital is tied up in the latter.There has to be a better argument than that and someone has to explain how a management team could so screw it all up so quickly.Management started with a rational plan... increase the distribution 10%/quarter... then management and greedy big investors changed the plan and sank the company.  So if sand is your play maybe you look at SLCA because it is certainly a better of breed play and already a C corporation model.Management overpaid the greedy big investors to buy their way out of the GP/IDR model and that is the core problem right now.  Yes sand prices came down but the old model could have sustained that increasing distribution model.  I don't think the increased share count can maintain that distribution growth model AND conversion to C status almost assures the need for a distribution cut closer to the yield of a SLCA anyway.,

Most Permian Brown Sand will not be long term solution for E& P's.  This is simply a fact-- draw your own conclusions with this fact...,
"Covia have been the most vocal about the benefits of NWS...but FANG (one of the leading pure Permian plays) has switched to 100% in-basin sand for completions. So the judge is certainly still out there...EMES has no last mile solution and jumped even more today, and is significantly more leveraged than the other sand players (and smaller scale); this is a clear rotation into the sector with most actors benefiting, HCLP and EMES the most. Clearly, they will need to confirm that their operations are sound. I also suspect that the payout will be cut once the conversion completed, unless the business is doing surprisingly well.HCLP might have better margins than most other players with lots of terminals, Propstream, etc. but sand prices are still down and out and the completions will not turn around so quickly as long as oil stays below $50; but again, the key is how much NWS is being used. I still believe the Marcellus is waking up this year and sand demand will be high from there. That should offer support. As for the stock going up so much today? Classic short squeeze, speculators rushing and/or news has leaked...",

Apart from last mile moats, Covia has a presentation saying that NW makes a (even) an average Permian well quite a bit more profitable over its lifetime and that the initial higher cost is recaptured, on average, after 6 months.

"Todd, thanks for the article. I'm continuing to hold my relatively small position (around 2% of my portfolio) and will continue to collect dividends while I wait for share price to recover. If that's this year, next year, or sometime in the future, fine.",
Looks like a short squeeze is in motion,
The assumption of a safe dividend is a little bold.  HCLP will convert to a C corp in a few months and they will likely set their dividend lower but promise faster growth.  I'd like to see them set the annual dividend at $0.75 with a special dividend in Dec dependent on free cash flow.  That would leave them with a lot more flexibility to weather these extreme swings in sand pricing.  It is my largest holding but I'm not blind to the uncertainty the transition creates.  If they could get a valuation on par with SLCA then the share prices should be great.  Really wish those two would merge while the market is so weak.,

"Hi, thanks for the article, I appreciate the point of view. Author, I enjoy your stuff, generally. Your perspective helps keep me grounded on a name like TSLA, in particular. Thanks for trying to let the numbers tell the story, and for measuring that story against Musk's prognostications.I'm currently neutral TSLA; to me, an overvalued story stock, and one that seems to me to be capital constrained, too. I've never understood why TSLA hasn't raised meaningful new equity capital. But, the company seems to keep pulling funding rabbits out of its hat. In any case, I hope TSLA learned a few lessons from the M3. I'm actually conflicted on M3. On one hand, TSLA's come a long way in less time than I'd imagined. On the other hand, measure M3 against Musk's initial prognostications, and, to me, M3 is, if not an outright fiasco, then a very real disappointment, at least from an investor's point of view. If TSLA'd managed to build M3 in volume and at a price point of $35,000 for a base model at decent gross margins, I'd likely be singing a bullish tune.  I hope TSLA ultimately succeeds, but, to me, the name is one of the riskiest out there.  If they do manage to build their new factories and launch the Y, for those long the name, better hope reservations flood in for the vehicle.Anyway, I like to track TSLA's 5.30% bond, due 8/15/25.

With cheap gas in the US many wonder about Tesla's longevity, yet sales in Canada remain robust and deliveries are about to start in Europe where the Model 3 is highly anticipated and this will surely grow as sales and deliveries ramp up.One thing that seems to be clear is more and more people are hearing about Tesla, the more I drive my Model 3, the more I find people asking about it and showing interest,, I suspect sales will keep improving as people find out just how amazing the car is.",

A homebuyer in Canada must make a 20% downpayment, or purchase government provided insurance to bring his equity up to 20%.  There is no ""shadow banking"" system in Canada as there is in the US.  Consider that from March 2008 to 2009 house prices in Canada fell 7%, while prices in Miami fell 29%, 25% in Los Angeles and 15% in Chicago.  Importantly, mortgage interest is not tax deductible in Canada, which further discourages leverage.

"Very poor analysis. Do you notice how the price to cash flow takes a huge gap down in the chart to arrive at your so-called ""record low"" price to cash flow number? That's because Starbucks got a big, one time cash infusion from selling its packaged goods unit to Nestle. That doesn't happen in a vacuum - the company gave up hundreds of million in operating income from that sale. It sold the asset to Nestle at a mid-teens valuation multiple, and is using the proceeds to buyback stock at a mid-20's valuation multiple. Complete corporate mismanagement aimed at boosting EPS numbers to hide the fact that the core business is deteriorating. One look at same store sales trends tells the whole story in one easy metric (hint: secular declines across all major operating regions).Do yourself a favor and plot the operating income of the core business, and you'll see that Starbucks is suffering from rising input costs and slowing sales growth, which has caused their operating income to flatline over the last 3 years. All the growth in EPS is from financial engineering, i.e. borrowing money to buyback stock. Selling puts is free money, really? Good luck with that strategy as we head into a global recession with spiking volatility and declining consumer purchasing power. Starbucks borrowing money to buy back shares at 25x PE ratio will prove a disastrous strategy a few years down the road. Disclosure: I'm long puts.",

"Re, ""BB's successful transformation"" successful?? Sorry but no, in fact quite the opposite.",
"“First, BlackBerry (BB) exited the loss-making business of handset manufacture.”JC wanted to revive handset, via BB10 and then via Android.  You can’t call it a win by losing.   Furthermore, you can’t call firing everyone in hardware and call it a win.  A caterpillar could of excited hardware by firing everyone.  You make it sound like JC sold handset for billions like Nokia or Motorola did.  JC excited hardware with a tiny azz licensing agreement.  “It then won a huge legal settlement with Qualcomm over patents.”It sounds impressive until you realize it is a payment dispute, not patent.  Any butterfly would have recovered the $$ based on a signed contract.  “Chen monetized BB’s intellectual Property portfolio, which currently generates around $45 million every quarter.”That is a legit win and JC has emphasized suing everyone.  But monetizing on old communication patents when you are out of the business is not that impressive.  “Most importantly, BB has successfully transformed itself from a hardware company into a software company.”When you have ten business, excited 9 of them.  I would not call it transformed.  BB has been cornered into a very small software niche. “Blackberry Technology Solutions, which includes embedded software and assets tracking, grew its revenues by 23% year-over-year. Growth in BTS continued to be driven primarily by BlackBerry's QNX division, according to John Chen. QNX's infotainment platform is already installed in more than 120 million cars worldwide.”Pointing out one aspect means you have to point out another.  BB main business, arguably is the EMM business and JC has driven that into the ground.  Software has arguably been the hottest play the last 5 years and BB has performed badly against real software plays.“In John Chen's words: ""The combined technologies will result in BlackBerry being the only company in the market to deliver a comprehensive endpoint cybersecurity platform with strong prediction technology.”That sounds impressive, but it is all jargons. You really think Softy or Airwatch could not do the same thing if it was that important to string together multiple jargons?  It reminds me of JCP when they say they have salons, jewelry and makeup under one roof, like damn, who cares.  “Since the price tag for the acquisition is $1.4 billion, revenues for the year ending April 2019 will be at least $200 million. That is an increase of more than 50% over previous fiscal year's $130 million.”Forward in this context, is most accurately meaning BB revenue under their ownership the first 12 months (March 2019 to Feb 2020).  Its JC lingo.  JC paid 1.4M to acquire 200M in BB revenue. “With an enterprise value of $2.5 billion, BB is trading at only 2 times my estimated 2019 revenues.”Little bit of double counting there.  1) you Count the revenue from Cylance and then don’t count the cash BB will have to forfeit in the enterprise value #.  Cylance was a huge cash burn company so revenue growth won't neccessary mean cash growth. “Software companies tend to trade at multiples closer to 5.”BB mostly resembles Mobile Iron and Symantec and BB is in line with those.  There are plenty of software play.  BB is attractively priced but the reasons you described are non-sense.",

In reality, BlackBerry overpaid Qualcomm, and the ""huge legal settlement"" was just a repayment of those funds.",
"@Herve van Caloen : Good article, Hervé! Just thought I'd offer a few picky comments for the sake of clarification.  1. The ""huge legal settlement with Qualcomm over patents"" makes it sound as if BB won a challenge based on the patents themselves, but both companies were in full agreement about Qualcomm's IP. The conflict was about the excessive royalties Qualcomm had charged BB for use of the patents. 2.  You say that BB’s ""intellectual Property portfolio currently generates around $45 million every quarter."" I appreciate that it's best to take a conservative line, but based purely on the numbers we've seen in the past 6 quarters for Licensing/IP (average = $58.5m), I think your number could be revised upward to $55 to $65m/q. But if we're talking ""pure"" licensing of IP -- and ignoring the BBM Consumer and BlackDroid licensing deals -- then we're talking more like $25 to $30m per quarter. 3. You may be right that Cylance will generate $275m in FY2019 -- and I'm also hoping you're right -- but we don't even know exactly when Cylance will hit the $200m figure. When Chen said he purchased the company for ""less than 7X forward revenue"", he didn't specify what he meant by ""forward."" For all we know it could be any one of the following: Feb. 28/19, mid-2019, or YE2019.",

I expect they will be actively buying bonds in the open market in addition to some stock buy backs (they really can't help themselves) with the thought that they have until the 4Q earnings to gobble up these prices.They can be a bit cavalier with their capital structure and I hope they apply that aggressive mindset to their debt profile currently.

The dividend will be significantly higher, and the share count will be at least 20-25% lower.

"Your argument has a fundamental flaw. You say that “unit sales were basically flat and didn’t have any predictive value for the business in the last few years.”That is entirely false. If unit sales have been flat but revenue and eps have been growing (which they have), this is indeed a very important insight. It means, in relation to iPhone, for example:- Average selling prices may be driving financial performance more than volume. Sustainability of this should be evaluated.- Market saturation may have started to occur and so the replacement cycle ma be more critical to performance than new customer uptake. A risk the company must carefully manage so as not to ‘do the Nokia’- Service and ancillary revenues need to deliver the halo that the product ecosystem historically achieved for Apple when it was a smaller beast(Etc etc...)I have been a long term shareholder of Apple.

"Apple employees crack up when we read this stuff. Apple is the pinnacle of engineering and the eco system we are creating with the iPhone and mobile technology will be so deep that it will almost be unmatched in the next few years. Unit sales declines don't matter because its about creating and adapting that ecosystem - tell me how many more people use an iPhone (switch from another OS) YoY. That should be the real metric. Less people buy phones because more people already own them. Apple is doing a great job monetizing the use of the iPhone and those margins and revenue will increase significantly in the future. 1st goal was to get the iPhone as the main mobile unit of as many people in the world as possible, which unit sales will eventually decline once a higher percentage owns an iPhone. 2nd goal is to create an ecosystem so no one would ever want to switch away from an iPhone because they are so in grained in all the features that it would be a hassle and downgrade to switch.3rd goal is to monetize the use of the phone.This equals steady and growing recurring revenue. Constant hardware sales with high margins, and increasing user monetization with higher margins. These analysts are crooks, so easy to see through.

Once that is lost sentiment will drive the share price. Combine this with a global decline in growth; RQE etc then we should all be buying Apple at a much more competitive price than today.

"Some interesting information from 12-31-18 news story:Nokia  has long had a relationship with U.S. national-security officials, which in 2015 formally reviewed the Finnish company during its acquisition of French rival Alcatel-Lucent. As part of that merger,  Nokia  bought  Bell Labs , the famous  New Jersey  research center that does sensitive U.S. government work.Leaders at both companies have been careful not to publicly pile on against  Huawei , according to people familiar with the matter.  Nokia  and  Ericsson  are competing to be the top supplier in their industry in  China , which promised about 30% of its telecom-equipment market to European companies as part of a 2014 settlement with the  European Union , according to people familiar with the matter.About 12% of  Nokia's  2017 telecom-equipment revenue of  20.5 billion euros  ( $23.5 billion ) came from its  Greater China  region, which includes  Hong Kong ,  Macau  and  Taiwan . An  Ericsson  spokesman said 7% of  Ericsson's  2017 revenue of 201.3 billion Swedish kronor ( $22.3 billion ) came from  China . Nokia's  telecom-equipment business now has six research-and-development centers in  China  and more than 50 offices spread over megacities and provinces in the country. As of the end of 2017,  Nokia  and  Ericsson  each had an equipment- manufacturing site in  China .In 2017,  Nokia's  telecom-equipment business had about 15,000 employees in its  China  region -- about double its Finnish head count.

"Hey CN,I know you don't give much credence to this but I believe that Malone knows how to manage  debt in order to create hedges that control the value of his targets in a manner that is not illegal and is in the best long term interest of Liberty shareholders.  I believe Buffet knows these techniques, and will be patient with Malone.This is obviously hypothetical, so I am interested in your opinion since we tend to be night and day:)Malone has put himself into a situation where he has a low cash flow generating ""controlling company"" controlling a high cash flow generating company leaving him in a predictable swap scenario if he wants the control of siri cash flow.   His stated his intent to do this so the game is on.           Essentially, it has to do with supplying shares of his target companies to be loaned to groups that are either shorting the stock or hedging the loans.    This way Liberty gets low interest loans with long durations to drive expansion within Liberty and creates market controls on his targets.     A likely similar example of this is how he has used siri to purchase P.      First P turns down what Malone thinks is a reasonable price for P.    Than Malone negotiates, through siri, a convertible loan to P (convertible is key).   He gets rid of his big obstacle (Westergren) and gets the essential board seats and chairman position.  Then surprisingly (or not), P takes an additional toxic loan that is backed by P shares (I believe $250 Mil).    Then siri makes another offer for P and siri and P shares drop sharply and then trade in concert.    Is it possible that the loans created a supply of loanable P shares and the offer created a purpose to hedge.   Could these loanable P shares be used to lock P and siri together while the purchase is progressing.          So, in this case Malone likely knew that if he supplied the market with loanable shares of P and siri that the stocks would lock together in arbitrage until he unlocks them by paying back the loans and drying out the short side of loaned shares.   This will happen when the purchase is complete.Liberty and siri are similarly locked together.  They have been trading at a 30% discount for some time no matter what happens to the market.   There is no way a free market could do that especially considering that institutions have been selling more than buying of siri and buying more than selling the liberty siri trackers, for quite some time now.   Even though siri has stopped buying shares during the stand off period, the 30% discount still remains?   So, I believe that Malone and Maffei know exactly why the discount persists (even though they act as if they don't) and that it wont begin to go away until they payoff their margin loans.    That likely won't happen until they have 100% of Siri and now P.  So right now we are in an interesting situation.  Due to siri purchasing P Malone will have to wait or possible lose NOLs.   I think maffei said about 2 years?    If Malone makes another offer it should set the discount to the offer ratio (Maffei also eluded to that).   Maybe a reminder to the short side.   The short side will likely start letting loose of siri before the offer.   Say a year and a half.  Until then, it will be a battle between the shorts and the synergies of the siri/P deal.   If siri implements the synergies quickly than the shorts will have trouble holding siri down and the Liberty takeover of siri could be jeopardized.   So, I suspect that we will see a slow walk on the synergies until Malone fully has siri in the liberty family. Interestingly, it looks like Malone is planning ahead.  He has recently created a margin loan against his LYV shares.    Maybe he is worried that the market will get exuberant and drive LYV up too high to make a reasonable deal when the time comes.  So, offer a few loanable shares to the market to keep LYV locked down.So the Pandora deal, which I believe to be long term good, has given me reason to extend my time frame in this vertically integrated financial engineered conglomerate.   I suspect that Maffei will not make an offer for Siri for 2-3 years, while siri continues to buy back shares and uses up all the NOL's that are in Jeopardy.    Than I think that Malone will try to lock down the exuberance on LYV and then commit to that deal in ~5 years, giving him time to work through what he plans for I-heart using siri's money.  So, I hope investors in siri are patient and I think if they are they will be rewarded handsomely:)   Therefore if you are long (5 to 10 years) and willing to take a little risk, liberties tracker is a very nice possibility.",
Is it safe to assume that Berkshire is betting on the Jockey rather than the horse?,
"I can see the mathematical advantage to the tracking stocks as you describe it. However, you don't seem to try to understand why the discount exists. IMHO, there is less appetite to own an entity created largely for the purpose of unlocking/creating value for the majority owner.

"So far the skepticism on Tesla's autonomy efforts centred around the rejection of LIDAR and the bet on computer vision advances using neural network. (Enough people believe in this at this point. Waymo has reasons to bet on LIDAR since it started this project at a different time and does not have access to as much data). The article discusses the issue of neural network based path planning which hasnt been discussed before. It is important to remember that unlike Waymo and other competitors, Tesla does not have to be the first to achieve full autonomy to profit from this or disrupt everyone else.

"@Trent Eady It is simply not possible that Tesla could suddenly (in 2019) get a boost from autonomous drive developments, when objectively speaking, each year it becomes clearer that Tesla's falls further behind the leaders. In fall of 2016 Tesla released the fakey video of an autonomously driving Tesla. Then it promised the coast-to-coast drive in 2017. Didn't happen in 2017. Tesla promised it in 2018. Didn't happen in 2018. Now Tesla has stopped selling FSD, and the R&D budget is quite slim. In the meantime, other companies actually have deployed level 4 systems on the roads. Tesla does have an asset in its driver assist tech package, but that asset's value is intrinsically linked to the volume of Tesla vehicle sales. There is not some magical ""thing"" out there that will suddenly change anything for Tesla this year. The hardware in the cars doesn't support it, and the introduction of the new chip will not suddenly introduce new capabilities. Until Tesla's Autopark can deal with walls/pillars, and until Summon works, you can kiss any more talk about ""Tesla Mobility"" goodbye. The second problem with your thesis here is that these other companies are actually deploying systems on the roads, and as they do, market perception of problems/near-term profitability prospects inevitably gets a perceptual correction. Waymo is losing money hand over fist, and analysts are increasingly looking at the effort with skepticism:www.pymnts.com/...Your entire article is not just heedlessly optimistic with regard to Tesla, but notably out of touch with changes in the market assessment for this technology. The final problem with this article is that it ignores the impact of the rising cost of capital; the billions being spent by various companies to work on auto-drive tech are not going to find much in the way of profitable niches for some years to come, which discounts the present value of any expected future return to a very substantial degree.

"I don't think we will see true ""Fully Autonomous Driving"" until there is some roadway infrastructure to support it.  The systems (which I will admit are extremely sophisticated and amazing) are strictly reactive to a small area surrounding the car.  It's the predictive nature of driving that these systems lack and it's a big issue when it comes to safety, safety that comes from the ability to predict potential developing hazards and make defensive adjustments while driving.  Driving requires awareness of immediate surroundings as well as traffic issues developing in the distance or two lanes to the right or left.  Construction areas where the lanes may be shifted daily or even multiple times per day.  Drivers also rely on hearing to detect situations that are not yet visible (fire truck/police car/ambulance approaching an intersection with an obstructed view.  None of the systems hear.  The systems don't adjust front following distance to reduce rear end hazards from someone following too closely.In reality no matter how much data is gathered driving is a task that occurs in a very fluid environment where no two situations are ever the same, similar yes, but not the same.",
"@Trent Eady Interesting and preceptive article!Tesla is the only player installing full autonomy hardware in cars at production volumes. This puts Tesla ahead of competitors in a very important and significant way. Tesla already fielding the hardware for autonomous driving in full-up production configuration not only means Tesla can deploy self driving capability quickly to a large, existing fleet of customer cars, it also means that Tesla will have the designs, supply chain, manufacturing and field support in place to immediately produce fully autonomous cars and deliver these in volume to customers as soon as they have autonomy working. The schedule advantage obtained by having hardware, supply chain, manufacturing and field support already in place is at least a year. That is, any Tesla competitor that succeeds in 'solving the autonomy problem' will still be a year or more from being able to deliver that solution to customers at scale because no Tesla competitor is currently equipping their production cars with full sensors and actuators; has autonomy hardware supply chain in place; has trained field support people to support autonomous cars needed to deliver their autonomous cars at volume to customers.On the other hand, should Tesla achieve an autonomy solution before competitors begin designing the hardware into production cars, Tesla will at that point have a year or more head start, even if a competitor already has autonomy working at 'laboratory scale' with a fleet of dedicated, non-production cars.The risk to legacy carmakers of being left behind if Tesla achieves autonomy should not be minimized. There is a lot more in play for any of the large legacy carmakers than simply losing out on early adopters of autonomous vehicles. Legacy players will be facing a 'double whammy' if they are not immediately prepared to contest market share within autonomous cars because once autonomous cars arrive, the handwriting will be on the wall for collapsing volumes of conventional (non-autonomous) cars because autonomy is the key enabler for a switch to TaaS. If a legacy carmaker fails to immediately contest market share in autonomous vehicles when the technology begins reaching customers, that company will face dwindling prospects for conventional cars going forward together with likely exclusion from autonomous vehicles which will own the 'value' historically hels by individually owned, non-autonomous cars.Should a legacy carmaker competitor to Tesla achieve success solving the autonomy problem, it will still be a year or more before such a competitor will be able to deliver their solution at scale and the market will have time to 'digest' the implications. However, if Tesla achieves an autonomy solution, Tesla is poised to deliver that solution to owners of existing cars and to customers for new Tesla cars very quickly. That will be much more of a shock to markets. And a likely exciting time for Tesla investors both long and short.",
FSD already bigger than tulips.,
"The current implementation of ""Fully Autonomous Driving"" is far from ready for general use and in reality creates more danger to the driving public as opposed to increasing safety.  This is supported by the reports of vehicles striking immobile objects while driving on the highway.  Tesla recommends (and requires) that drivers keep both hands on the wheel and states that the driver should maintain full awareness at all times.  Why? Because when the computer cannot correctly asses the situation it will cede control to the driver.   In theory this sounds like a good plan but in reality we know that drivers will become complacent the longer the self driving feature performs as designed.  It is only when the human driver has to take over things become problematic.  The human driver has relaxed their vigilance and at the moment they need to take over will need time to assess the situation and take action.  Time that they do not have.  In cases where fixed objects were struck the question should be, would those accidents have occurred if autonomous driving was not in use at all.There was a recent video posted of a Tesla making an emergency stop and avoiding a rear end collision.  This is an example of a successful failure.  The car successfully avoided the collision but in doing so created the danger of being struck itself from the rear.   The police car which was stopped at the scene of the accident (which the car was approaching) had it's lights on and was clearly visible from a distance.  A human driver would have begun to increase following distance to allow more time to stop.  This has the effect of reducing the rate of deceleration if/when a stop is required giving any vehicles following more time to react as well.  This reduces the likely hood of being struck in the rear.Tesla's car cannot hear.  In an urban environment the human driver will often hear the approaching sirens long before they come into view.  Hearing those sounds prompts the driver to slow down and increase vigilance, espescially when approaching an intersection with a cross street.  The autonomous car would see the green light and simply keep going only reacting when the emergency cross traffic comes into view (which might be too late even for the computer to react).Tesla always states that the autonomous driving system was functioning and was not at fault when a crash occurs but was it the autonomous driving that lead the foundation for the crash to occur by allowing the driver to reduce their level of situational awareness to the point that they could not possibly avoid the crash in the first place.Adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, self parking are all features which enhance safety because the driver must still maintain primary control of the vehicle.  Fully autonomous driving has the human driver in a standby role which can only lead to more crashes.",

Whether they did or not they were clearly wrong, so why are they right about HW3? Will we find out in another 2 years that HW4 is required and then HW5? How long will those $5000 FSD buyers wait?Tesla's neural-net based FSD is a long-shot, it's effectively a fantasy, a dream. Could it happen, yes possibly but the chances are it won't - ever.Tesla won't even be able to compete in the EV space in 5 years, they're only selling cars now because there's no competition and there's no competition because there's no profit.

A lot of people today feel that their car is an extension of themselves, it says something about who they are. A commercial where the lady names her car ""Brad"" comes to mind. Will they buy a self driving car?  What about the folks who always seem to be in a hurry speeding and weaving in and out of lanes just to get to their destination 5 minutes sooner. Will they be happy to let a self driving car do the speed limit and not change course if a seemingly faster opportunity presents itself? I think not.",
"The ""autonomy"" that vehicles need is actually the opposite, in a way:  when most vehicles' computers in a particular traffic pattern are programmed to communicate with EACH OTHER in real time....that's when we've arrived safely at freedom from ""driver"" monitoring.

Even if the Tesla autopilot had performed perfectly for the 2+ years I have owned it, this single screw-up could easily cause disaster.  The reality is far worse for Tesla autopilot, which is an expensive toy that long ago lost its novelty.",

"""Experts"" on SA remind me of a story that happened at one of the institutions where I used to work as a radiologist.Orthopedic doctors wanted to win privileges to read and bill for bone and joint X-rays. And why not? They are bone experts after all. They can, of course, interpret images of bones and joints as well as radiologists. So radiology and orthopedics departments had a meeting.A shoulder X-ray went up on the screen. An orthopedist approached the image, and proceeded to give an eloquent, precise, detailed description of the joint position and alignment as well as bone integrity. His conclusion was spot-on: there were no issues with the bones or joints. With a victorious smile, he returned to his seat.It was the radiologist's turn. She did not even get up from her chair. ""The bones are unremarkable. There is a large spiculated mass in the left upper lobe, consistent with malignancy.""The expertise of a radiologist is not in merely knowing how disease processes look. It's also in the art of not missing important findings like cancer.Most articles I read here resemble the orthopedist's report (often without the orthopedist-like excellent industry knowledge) rather than a radiologist's report. Corporate equivalents of cancer are missed too often; if they were picked up, they would often render the entire article irrelevant.",

People who chase performance and obsess about the latest Wall Street pundit's prognostications are speculating.

"A fine article as far as it goes.  A little local perspective from here in Chester County, PA, Mariner East 2 has been fraught with endless delays here in eastern PA due to spills, stoppages, and legal challenges from State agencies such as DEP and PUC as well as safety advocacy organizations.   On 01-01-2019, our local newspaper, The Daily Local News front page headline read: ""Infrastructure Approval - 350 mile Mariner East 2 pipeline now in service"".Reading further, there were these excepts from later paragraphs in that same article:""But that's being disputed by the project's critics who maintain that the original plan for a 20 inch pipeline called Mariner East 2 appear to be a mish-mash of three pipelines or what Sunoco says is a 'work-around' of 12 inch, 16 inch and 20 inch pipelines"".   ""An 80 year old 12 inch pipe bypasses about 23 miles of pipe, much of it incomplete in Chester County  and reconnects with the original Mariner East 2 in Delaware County"".In that same article, State Sen. Andy Dinniman, D-19 (Chester County) released the following statement Monday:  ""Sunoco is attempting to rebrand a group of predominately antiquated pipelines of various sizes as Mariner East 2, when originally Mariner East 2 was suppose to be a new 20 inch pipeline.  To make matters worse, these old pipelines have a history of leaks and were recently cited in a PUC complaint regarding concerns about corrosion.  This is a recipe for disaster and if Sunoco thinks we're going to be fooled by a name change, they are sorely mistaken"".That commentary seems mild compared to another appearing in that same article made by Del-Chesco United for Pipeline Safety (a grassroots safety organization):""Mariner East 2 was sold to investors as a new 20 inch pipeline.  Now, in an astonishing bait and switch worthy of investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sunoco has started using that term to refer to a cobbled-together 'Frankenpipe' that includes miles of pipe that's leaked repeatedly in Chester and Delaware counties.   In the latest of a series of accidents involving the ancient 12 inch segment used in this workaround pipeline, in June 2018 it leaked more than 34,000 gallons of gasoline in Delaware County.  Now Sunoco proposes to use this same pipeline to transport hazardous, highly volatile liquids - material that is far more dangerous than gasoline"".Getting the last leg of Mariner 2 East completed through highly congested Chester and Delaware counties to the Marcus Hook endpoint has been fraught by construction miscues, legal challenges, court ordered work stoppages, one after another.  Over much of 2018, we locals have become conditioned to bad press updates about Mariner 2 East.The pipeline may now be in service, but not yet as the 20 inch line from end to end as originally proposed.   While it may eventually be completed as proposed, bringing even more product flow capacity, cash flows and better results for we investors, lets hope in the interim nothing else goes wrong.",

"£32K to produce this medicine is on a par with the cost of medicines that up till now have been UNSUCCESSFULLY treating Dravet and Lennox G.  Another myth is that THC or full spectrum cannabis is necessary to treat the conditions Epidiolex is designed for;   No doctor will prescribe f'ull spectrum' cannabis oil for these conditions - especially not for a child - whether or not cannabis oil is ever fully legalised.  THC has no medicinal benefit for Dravet or Lennox G.  That is a fact.  I simply don't believe that thousands of parents are pumping their kids full of cannabis oil (whether that's CBD or with THC).  Firstly, how could they afford to?  Cannabis oil is not cheap!  Children anywhere with epilepsy will have been diagnosed by - and monitored - by a doctor.  No doctor is going to say, ""I can't prescribe cannabis oil for your child's epilepsy because it's against the law, but if I were you I'd go and buy some and play around with the dosage.""  But if, according to rumour, this is happening, and certainly if parents are dosing their children with THC for conditions that don't require THC, they should be reported for child abuse!  And to dose a child continually with CBD oil must be a distressing experience for the patient, because CBD oil tastes absolutely horrid with the taste lingering for a long time.  In any case, anyone able to afford the cost of cannabis oil will be able to afford the cost of Epidiolex, which is a bona fide medicine with proven efficacy, is the only CBD drug with US FDA and DEA approvals, and has been received favourably by insurance companies.  Europe/UK likely to follow suit with equivalent approvals.  What's not to get excited about with GW?!  Folk need to exercise better judgement when reading the mass of information available online.  Aspirin was produced for a reason... I don't see people stripping bark from a willow nowadays  and ingesting it to treat their headaches!",
"I am an advocate for Wellness and for all patients accessing the health products at the price points they can afford. The author does a great job of showing why and how GWPH is a bankable investment at the moment. I simply ask will GWPH be able to respond to needs at lower price points and will full spectrum products to compete against  phytoceutical and nutraceutical companies which will be able to bring their products to the market much, much faster and at various price points and as more legal jurisdictions open up. Not everyone has insurance and not everyone has $32,000 a  year for cannabis-derived medicines and these masses have to look for other options even if they have the same type of malady :-( There appears to be an entrenched mindset that just because a product goes through a familiar sanctioned process that it is somehow automatically better and safe - for those of us that have been impacted by it, the opioid crisis is a cautionary tale that adds nuance to that mindset.  Does GWPH claim to have an extraction method that is not available elsewhere? If it is not hydrocarbon, Ethanol or super critical CO2, then what is it pray tell and why isn't everybody using this extraordinary process, too? The CBD molecule is the same throughout. If GWPH is claiming that it has developed a chemovar that is unique than that would  be astonishing given the databases of thousands that are being accumulated in legal jurisdictions :-) I hope everyone can get well :-)",
"""Many"" of those in need :-)",
"EPIDIOLEX - Friend or Foe traffic.libsyn.com/...www.mikesmedicines.com/...Hopefully, it works and works well for everyone but there are questions being raised about dosage, the use of a single molecule, the lack of full spectrum use, and the side effects. If GWPH can sort through the issues, hopefully many can get healthy and at price points that everyone can afford  :-)",
"OMG!!  People, stop comparing OTC and dispensary grade/level/tested/available CBD wellness CPG products with a pharma solution FOR DRAVET AND LENNOX-GESTAUT DISEASES.  We're talking about two rare crippling childhood diseases, not aches and pains.  Suggesting a Charlotte's Web solution can help with these two diseases is like suggesting a baby aspirin (hell, even an adult dosage of ibuprofen) can help for chronic migranes.... maybe take like 125 baby aspirin at a time to up the dosage.  SMH",
"I think many people dont realize how much Epidiolex those patients are taking for treatment.    Yes for certain people with mild epilepsy they may be able to treat with smaller, retail size daily doses but the patients suffering from Dravet and the other condition Epidiolex has been approved by the FDA need massive doses of CBD. That kind of cost requires help from  insurance for most people. I think the community is small and well informed about Epidiolex and im betting most Dr.s will be recommending it to their patients. All imo",
My main question is; How much better is Epidolex than a good CBD oil. Is it really worth the difference?,
Organic is descriptive of how things are processed and the inputs; organic is not descriptive of the presence of THC :-),
"There isn't any THC in Epidiolex, only CBD. CW Hemp is CBD as well :-) No studies needed to see that Epidiolex is a single molecule CBD medication and CW Hemp is a full spectrum CBD oil or topical or capsule   :-) These are the current facts. No hype or obfuscation at all   :-)",
"I admire and respect that you stay on Coumadin. I tried it for a year and then decided that I was more scared of bleeding out then I was of having the heart attack that will eventually get me. Now I use cannabis, a biomat, herbal supplements (Natto Kinase), and vitamins for my circulation.  So, I use treatments consistently and not single molecule medications. I guess that is one difference in how people choose to get health: some use medications even with the awful side effects and other use treatments without side effects but perhaps with slightly less certainty. Best of health to you, Sir   :-) And for all of us hopefully, too :-)",
"I certainly agree with your overall evaluation and your comments of the enviable position that GWPH is in :-) When we know more of the pharmacology of cannabis then the explicit parallels can be made be visible. I am unclear if the FDA is really trusted at the level that you assert; maybe it is. They just reneged on their evaluation and approval of a few antibiotics so even after all that research and money they still have to call back medicines several years later that they mistakenly approved previously; they recently released a Fentanyl oral therapy which seems almost unconscionable given the opioid epidemic; their record is unbalanced in terms of the results. In addition, there are many of us who have suffered through the opioid crisis and the FDA has done almost nothing to stop it. A high school friend of mine lost his son to Fentanyl; I have a family member whose life is gradually being destroyed by an opioid addiction.  I am an advocate for wellness; if there are people who can afford $32,000 a year for Epidiolex then they are truly blessed. Cannabis has been health care for the urban and rural poor who cannot afford $32,000. For those of us without that type of money, we have to make do with organic, botanical medicines :-) The FDA is not responsive in some regards to this demographic. There might be no burgeoning cannabis industry and quite possibly no Epidiolex if the Stanley Brothers hadn't helped the family that was so desperate to save their child. It isn't ""hype"" at all; it really happened and their daughter really got well. This is fact, not fiction. But, I hope for you and the patients and the investors that GWPH does well. It is just not affordable nor urgently produced enough for the large masses of people who need help. Hopefully, there is enough wellness and health products for everyone at each price level  :-) IF the FDA really wants to make good rules then it should insist that all cannabis therapies are full-spectrum and organic :-) Anyway, best of luck :-) Hopefully wellness is on the way at all price levels.",
I don't own CW Hemp but I would if I could afford it :-),
CW Hemp also provides the template for Wellness branding.,
"Unfortunately, at the moment, the best and most affordable products (those that are bought in large quantities) are in dispensaries and online. The CW Hemp story illustrates why pharma will not be responsive to people's needs; CW Hemp gained fame by helping a family that could not get an answer from the medical/pharma community and their toddler's life depended on it. In addition, many pharma entities are already trying to attach cannabis to their legacy products; many of their products are simply too expensive, have horrible side effects including addiction, and take many, many years (7-15 years) to bring to market. The FDA/Pharma system is not responsive nor nimble enough and not even fast enough to help the people who need it in large numbers. Cannabis has potential because it is not the single molecule therapy that big pharma has used up until now. However, the FDA and the lobbyists have clearly put GWPH in a strong position until consumers learn more about organic, full-spectrum titrating.",
"GWPH will probably succeed because of FDA support and expensive lobbying efforts (in the AZ and PA markets and others apparently) but their Epidiolex is already careening in the wrong direction because of the side effects produced by a standardization of dosage that is not appropriate for all patients. Once patients understand that full spectrum cannabis is better and that titrating is necessary and that they can get a better product for $36 a bottle from CW Hemp, then the $32,000 a year price from Epidiolex will be implausible because most cannot afford it. CVSI might suffer once consumers realize that hemp must be grown organically or else it soaks up heavy metals and other items and pesticides making the product much less healthy than full spectrum, organic products. Once customers learn enough about the effects, they will probably not buy single molecule products like CBD isolates and non-organic products. Some companies will succeed in the interim (CVSI, for example) until customers learn to differentiate. However, the FDA and the lobbyists might determine the winners.",
"Been following GWPH for four years now and've been in and out of the stock several times at very decent profits.  An important distinguishing factor is this is a 'pharm' company, not a marijuana company.  All executives are from pharm and the company has been very careful to stay at arm's length from all the non-pharm competition.  Also - cannot emphasize enough how important it is they 'grown their own', taking years in developing strains aimed at specific medical problems and using more of the plant than just the buds, supporting the 'entourage' approach - meaning there's a lot more going on in this plant than just CBD or THC.  This is a solid, research-driven company which has more products in the pipeline.  GWPH is in a class by itself as you will not find its products in a 'dispensary', but only in your local pharmacy.",

"One of the things that kept Blizzard going is that it has a real storyline for 3 franchises.  Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo.  Without these storyline.  I doubt the fan base would have been as committed as before.  Yeah Fortnite is doing well, but Fortnite can go away in a heart beat if some else comes out that is better.  The same thing happened with CSGO and PUBG, it was the IT game for FPS until Fortnite came around.  Players are committed to many of the Blizzard games, because of the storylines and the game plays that occurs.  Its like playing in your own novel.  I am a 44 year old gamer, and remember playing the original Warcraft in my 20's.  I have played Blizzard games for over 20 years and they have always been that innovative company with good storylines, content and game play.  However, things are changing that is affecting PC gameplay and moving over to mobile.  Going to Blizzcon was like a religious event, but not anymore.  Some games Blizzard have on mobile are great like Hearthstone, even add-on apps like the auction house for WOW on your mobile are good to.  However, not everything.",

I don't think so. Blizzard is basically dismantled from the inside by Activision, and their dream that a forcefully ""rearranged"" company will succeed on the already crowded mobile market is but a fantasy.",
"Always funny to read articles like these that try to justify the stock fall post-factum (where have you been when ATVI was 80+?).How about TTWO - it's also down 30%+ with RDR2 doing extremely well? The only rationale I've heard so far was ""That's easy, TTWO was WAAAY overvalued"". There's NO articles on TTWO during last month. Not a single one. Obviously everybody and their mother are perplexed by it's weakness. Maybe you should write one as I sure want to see some ideas other than ""was waaay overvalued"" one.",
"I am a 33y/o PC gamer and I can attest that everyone is right. The critical eye that gamers are using on gaming companies now is very much different than it use to be. The average age of the PC gamer is much higher than it use to be. Most of the resinating complaints of corporate greed ruining the gaming industry started from EA and their yearly releases. People legitimately upset over the artistic quality of some of their most loved franchises being deliberately rushed and released in very poor states.Unfortunately, with games and teams getting bigger and bigger that is becoming an expected part of TripleA titles.Also, companies absolutely need to diversify what they create if what they are making just isn't selling like it use to. As much as it pains me to see more and more gaming moving mobile, if that is where the money is, then I cannot fault a company for pursuing it, especially when the people complaining about mobile games tend to be anti-microtransactions and anti-subscription.I play a game called ""Path of Exile"" which has cosmetic microtransactions. bundles that have suits of armor costing upwards of $300. Is that a crazy amount of money to spend on digital armor? Yup, but I have laid down $100 here and there because I understand that the community is smaller than most and I don't want to see the game dissapear. Online games cost money to maintain especially ""free"" ones. I've done the same with every online game I play at differing degrees of spending.With all that being said, I don't think that AVTI nor TTWO are done dropping. I think many gamers are looking to smaller companies  that deliver on what they are asking. I think ATVI will still drop another $10 and TTWO probably another $20-$30. I don't think now is the time to be buying for either.The other thing none is talking about is the video game driving sales for a lot of PC gamers is the purchasing of new rig GPUs and other PC parts. Which right now, the PC component market is still overpriced, which means less people upgrading which means less people buying games to test their systems.I honestly think the best bet on the electronics market is actually AMD. They are undervalued IMO with the potential game changer they have in the CPU market. Intel has hit its peak and is trying to break their way into the GPU market when they should be watching their backs on the CPU market. AMD has a very real possibility of becoming the standard workstation CPU choice for businesses.",
How should we value gaming stocks? their PE look pretty high,
"ATVI, EA, and TTWO had a $125 billion in combined market valuation that is $64 billion, $45 billion, and ~$16 billion respectively at their highs. I can see all three get to new highs or lows in a recession. EA will retake is #1 spot back in terms of revenue and market cap, ATVI slip to #2 with declining growth and the Blizzard issues, and TTWO like the old-new leader cross new revenue milestone (EA should do $7 billion in revenue 2020; ATVI should do ~$7 billion; TTWO should do $3 billion).",
"I've had my eye on ATVI recently and I may have to buy some soon. I didn't know about the CFO, hopefully that brings it down further.",
"@oriondc: You have fallen into the the outrage trap i would say (probalby to be in line with your friends ;). ATVI has to find new ways make additional revenues. The company cannot survive only from its die-hard fans. Competition is tough, younger people have other needs. The company is balancing its revenue streams right now.",
"The real problem with ATVI is their disconnect with their core customer.  They have no idea what those people want, and they don't care.  They are trying to apply the mobile cash shop paradigm to existing desktop PC properties that go back 15-20 years.  Those players are 35 years old and older and do not fall for $1 microtransaction gimmicks like a 17 year old does.  Until they wise up on this, I don't think this stock should go back up at all.",
"Worked years in the gaming industry, I'm pretty sure that any fan outrage towards ATVI will be only temporary. In this business gamers don't abandon companies, they abandon games. Make a great game or update/extension to an existing game, and all is well again. Also, is all this talk just noise or also seen in ATVI's numbers as a negative impact? What I've learned over and over again, is that a vocal minority is complaining in social media and forums, but nothing negative happens in the key KPI's of games. I wonder if this is the case with ATVI at the moment as well?",
The customers basically hate blizzard right now. The customer are the ones supplying the company with cash. So it is not a buy at the moment.,

The management of this company reeks, stinks to the high heavens, in my opinion. It reminds me of a classic boiler room, pump-and-dump scheme foisted on unsuspecting and unsophisticated investors. OK, so what? Well, the minute there's a whiff of regulatory interest in the dealings of Aphria and its cohorts, the stock price will collapse. The potential (and likely?) upshot is that the New York Stock Exchange will delist the shares. I dunno. Maybe a white knight (KO? Diageo?) will appear on the scene, fire the entire management team, take over, and run a tight ship. In the meantime, there's far more risk implicit in the current circumstances than this risk-tolerant investor can stomach. I sold my entire APHA position yesterday.",
What a joke.  Nothing but a smoke screen.  It be nice to find away to get some one to leed this company who is not in it for himself and friends.  A dinky no name company making that kind of offer.

Please raise an debt financing offer in an all-cash offer.If GGB is serious in providing an offer, and is touting $275MM revenue by 2020, then please offer a 2 to 3x multiple on $11/SP to acknowledge APHA projected revenue of $600 to $1,000MM revenue by 2020.GLTYA",
Why would anyone issue such a bs offer that has no credibility and will surely be rejected and only taint aphria further?And why does aphria not immediately dismiss it as a joke? It's beyond me.Are these people trying intentionally to ruin the company? Which serious investor or strategic partner will touch it now?,
All they got do to us force Vic out and admit they messed up.  And the show can get back on the road.,

I would be holding shares tonight for Trump Speech (sort of a mini State of The Union Address). Markets usually respond positively (next day) to Trump Addresses.,
"MU looking good at $33. Chip Sector is hot today! Appears hot money going back into chips. The Tech Sector drop started with the Chip stocks, so it makes sense that a Tech Sector Rally would start with them. The Close at 4:00 p.m. should be very interesting!",
Buying MU this morning at $31! Because it is more “Insanely Cheap”! than yesterday.,
"IoT, will be EVERYWHERE! Take McDonalds, if you go inside there is an option to order from a computer touch screen. IoT. Now multiply that times every fast food, coffee, yogurt and other food stores that may replace a person at a register. Now think about Authenta, MU award winning chip level security feature. And now wonder if NAND and DRAM will be MU main product in the next five years.

"LOL, told you buying MU around @50 was a bad idea, one of my comments few months ago ...I forgot who told me MU was a great value @50 lol",
You would think that after what the company (MU) went through back in 2016 with them losing money for the year they would be more prudent with how they spend money this time around.

I'd say it's more to do with price elasticity (lack of) and ignores structure of supply side so long as supply is capable of exceeding mkt demand.The current suppliers have the capacity to over-supply and demand is somewhat, but not absolutely, inelastic - hence over-supply results in quite dramatic price drops.Thinking about that - quite a lot like MU stock... !!",
"Question, almost every economics textbook will define commodity as many and many producers make the same products.  However, in the case of memory chips, there are only 3 major producers making almost 95% of the worlds memory chips.  So, does it make any sense to call MU a commodity producer?  I tend to disagree.",

Thanks for the article!!  GREAT this is the first time someone mentioned that not only the price of the Dram and Nand is going down but that the cost to produce is also going down. If the stock price doubled the PE would be 5. which is still only 1/3 of the PE of NVDA. Mu says they are rapidly invested in cap-ex to about 9B this year.

Long Tap,
Thanks for the article. A good company at a cheap price. It doesn’t need to go lower it’s worth buying right here.,
Free cash flow margin is about half of what it was in the third quarter but at 13% it is still rather healthy. The debt is a continuing anchor on the stock price though.,
Tap is in dire straits. Any market drop just kills the stock value. Wait till the 45$ mark,
"The ~$55 level is a good entry point on a stable & safe company like TAP, which has been cut in half since late 2016.The company is cheap on basically any fundamental metric. I have no idea what the share price will do over the short-term, but it's not hard to imagine this company at $100+ again in a few years.",

"If you guys can just calm down a bit and see the facts.1) Apple is a leader in the consumer tech field. Whatever they do, others follow. And whatever others do first, don't usually fly until Apple does it. Weird huh?2) The smartphone market is slowing for all brands, not just for Apple. There is nothing new coming out from other brands either. What did you expect? Each brand releases a new phone each year. I was an Android fan and have been supporting phones with Google branding (Nexus, Pixel). On the Pixel 3 XL pre-order, they offered a free wireless stand. Then the first week on the launch date, they offered to slash $250 CAD off. I had to return the order and re-ordered, which took awhile because there is no physical Google stores.3) I got rid of my Pixel 3 XL because there were a few Apps that were installed without my consent. You can't even see them in your phone, they appear on the Play Store under installed Apps. Those Apps were from Google just to collect data from you which significantly improve service and user experience. At the end of the day, you need to decide if Privacy is more important than Smart user experience.Oh, I didn't like how much the phone vibrated at the back (middle) while on speaker even on low to medium volume.The call quality was bad, maybe just for my particular phone. The other side could hear that I started a sentence, but usually missed the last 2-3 words. Because of this, I got so mad and finally sold it at a huge discount on the second hand market.The original price was $1,259 - $250 = $1,009 plus 13% sales tax (Ontario Canada), that would be $1,140.17. It was sold to a second hand dealer for $800. Oh, that was the high end model with 128 GB storage. I took a ~30% haircut for only 1 month of usage.The stock Android experience is not so stock anymore. I noticed some Google Apps that I didn't install and they can not be uninstalled (can be disabled though). If I do decide to return to Android in the future, I might choose Samsung over Pixel. I hope Samsung got rid of most of their bloatware. It was ridiculous back in the days, which prompted me to switch to Google branded phones.4) Apple has physical locations which you can go in for service like changing a battery. I had to use a Google authorized repair shop to do the work. The Google authorized repair shop costed more, but the service was awesome I must admit. Due to lack of physical locations, it would be hard for me to buy and/or return things.Now the bad things about switching to iOS. I feel handcuffed by the iOS. Everything felt so free and enjoyable on the Pixel 3 XL, but the iOS is so strict and lacks enjoyment. I am now using my iPhone less and less. Not necessarily a bad thing. However, whenever I needed my phone, it's always there. Things like watching YouTube (premium) is not as enjoyable anymore because it lacks PIP, so I can't surf the web while watching.",

"@ Billy Duberstein  ""If Apple didn't repurchase more than $20 billion in the quarter, analysts should ask a lot of questions.""Apple is not in the business of stock buy back timing.I don't think AAPL repurchased any more than $20B again as far as cash spent, but they sure should have been able to buy back a lot more shares than last quarter with the drop in stock price.",
Omg. History will not treat stock buybacks kindly. Management falling over themselves to buy $10 stocks for $20 just so their stock options vest. Investors deserve everything that is coming their way.,
How many? A lot. Keep buying as long as the cash flow keeps coming.,
You did not mention the repurchase authorization which was capped at $100 billion this year.  At the start of the quarter they had about $70 billion left.  There’s also the issue that Apple makes about $15 billion per quarter in net earnings so no they’re not going to be getting to cash-neutral anytime too soon.  But your point is well taken and I bet they spent a lot on repurchases - hopefully well above the prior quarters.,
"I wonder if there was a strategic move to not announce unit sales, so that the share price would tank. And in return do a lot of buybacks.",
nice write up. I've often been curious how much discretion companies have when deploying share buybacks.if apple could have theoretically spent all their cash it would indeed be disappointing if they didn't significantly ramp up buys in December,

"Louis: Thanks for your kind replies to my comments.If 25% of the float was retired, that means that the cost of the buybacks was either done from cash produced by profits and/or debt  to purchase the shares.That essentially means that the Corp. and common shareholder surrendered (lost) that money to purchase the shares retired.There are implications, of course, going forward, about benefits due to reduced float, which also, however, are by no means certain.Share buybacks paid at lofty levels above intrinsic value are seldom a good idea for the common shareholder, and are vastly overblown by the financial media, often to the detriment of the common shareholder.IBM surely found that out , but the Corp. officials will never, ever admit it because it is not in their personal best interests to do so.",

They can bribe foreign officials to use their product.4. They can form monopolies.5.

I don't welcome a dividend cut, but as Warren Buffet said years ago, 4% is pretty realistic for stocks going forward.  In my 40 years of stock trading, I can only recall KHC hitting $100. per share twice.  KHC needs to do a far better job reducing costs, reducing bloated management, improving logistics, and share buybacks.  KHC needs  to follow MOs 50 year track record until very recently, and be accountable to the KHC shareholders.  Remember shareholders own the company!!",

Cutting dividend works fine if they decide to reduce their leverage faster, as a prudent move.PE (TTM) is now around 12, with earning growth being expected at 3%. This is very depressed valuation.

That would be a ways down from here,Both have the same marketing problems to overcome. I just think that GIS has better financial management and a much safer divvy..",

It literally went down every day for December. Even on positive gis earnings it fell which doesn’t make sense to me.,
"I can’t believe it is so cheap. Makes me wonder if they are hiding something like pension obligations the way GE did. If KHC financials are honest, then this is a real bargain. They paid for marketing new products in 2018 and should have a revenue boost in 2019. Profit margin is impressive.",

I might add more if it drops more.Although it has a lot of debt, it appears manageable, as long as they don’t take on much more debt.It does bother me that Heinz was bought for about $23B and Kraft for about $10B. KFC’s enterprise value is much higher, so, it looks like most of the costs have already been wrung out.

"Given the almost 50% holdings of 3g and Buffet, there is NO chance of a private equity takeover . The problem with KHC is twofold; lower margins due to consumers migrating to private label brands and its 30b debt. The latter can be partially reduced via a dividend cut , while the former is going to be impossible to surmount without lower prices and thus lower margins and lower free cash flow.So investors should plan for two things. First a dividend cut to less than 2$ and second lower P/E s in the future. So let’s play a guessing game . The dividend is cut to 1.50 yielding %4. That results in a stock price of 37.5$P/E of 10 on an average analyst estimate of 3.73$ resulting in a stock price of 37.3$Of course these are just plug in numbers based on assumptions, but these numbers show that while KHC MIGHT  have another 10-15% more on the downside, it is becoming , the risk reward at current prices has become much more favorable .",
"Good comments by the author and David RG.   As the price keeps dropping I keep trying to find a reason to go long KHC but keep coming up empty handed.   Under pressure from hundreds of new specialty brands, private label growth and retailer consolidation they are facing the dilemma of sacrificing sales growth or lowering margins.   Given they have downsized their R&D capability it will be difficult to realize the sales growth + margin growth that follows innovative new product and product category introductions.   Resulting in less leverage with retailers.  Primal Nutrition is a nice start but will not move the needle anytime soon.   Given a choice I believe KHC is going to have invest margin to get sales growth over the next 2-3 years....... and tell the marketplace they are going to do so.   Similar to what WMT, KR, TGT, AMZN/WFM and other retailers have done to be competitive long term.   The continued loss of sales is a downward death spiral.   Spinning off weaker assets to lower debt service and rebuilding an R&D infrastructure will also be important.   Can 3GG do this?",

Shale is being used incorrectly. It’s short-cycle production with quick production and high declines rate thus should only be drilled when prices are high.

"Having hedges in place definitely makes a difference. It looks like the average Q1 2017 CXO well produced 229,000 BO in the first 18 months and was producing at a rate of 218 BOPD at month 18. It appears wells in quarters thereafter are following the Q1 2017 wells very closely. These are good wells IMO. Whether these wells payout at $40 depends on royalty, LOE, G & A, cost to drill, complete and equip, etc.  If we assume on these new wells the severance, LOE and G & A costs us $5 per BO, at $40 at the well, the net would be $6 million. That is pretty good, but much depends on well costs. I haven’t included gas, and this can really make a difference, especially what price CXO is getting for gas. If a good amount of hedges are in place at higher prices than present, those should be figured in. The author keeps saying CXO is profitable at $40 oil, but I am not finding the math behind this statement, nor am I finding in the article what profitable means. It might be helpful if SA authors analyzing shale producers would actually analyze things like well production rates, well costs, LOE, G & A. Maybe also try to figure out how much land cost should be allocated per well. This would seem to be very important, especially in the Permian, where there have been many high cost Permian land purchases. There are several resources where production data may be obtained. Company 10K and 10Q have LOE and G & A data, and also you can get some idea of what well CAPEX is costing. I think if an SA author or two would actually dig down on some of these companies, it would be more helpful. I have made some calculations in the past, back of napkin type. But, I don’t have the time to dig deep into company data to be more precise. Anyone that has followed this space closely knows that company presentations are not precise. I think if an SA author would actually drill down to the well level, he or she would find that there might be many who would follow that author closely. After all, this is an industry where most companies just do one thing, they drill oil and gas wells. Also, many are pure play shale and many are just in the Permian basin, where the major US supply growth is coming from. So, it would seem utilizing company financials and public production data would be very helpful in analyzing the shale space.",

There is a word short interest in the company. Makes me wonder about the potential for a short squeeze should the company have a stellar fourth quarter and provide bullish guidance.,
"The bull case is that the stock trades with a PE of 10 compared to next year's estimated earnings, and the real estate that DDS owns is likely worth the market cap of the company today. So when you buy the company, you are getting the real estate for free, or vice versa. DDS has retired ~30% of its shares over the past 3 years. The bear case is that the business has deteriorated rapidly over the past 3 years (cash flow and normalized earnings are down ~50% over that timeframe). Cash flow per share and earnings per share aren't down as much because of the substantial buy backs,  but the business is deteriorating faster than it is buying back shares. The company is controlled by the Dillard family - by a separate voting class share - to such an extent there is no opportunity for a catalyst from an activist investor. Little information is provided quarterly or annually.BTW, valueinvestorsclub.com has a much better write up on DDS that was published a few months ago....",

"TPL closed the week at over $753.  My best guess is that TPL will hit a new record high in price at some point during 2019.  Mr. Boyd doesnot understand that TPL is ""unique"" in that there is no other stock likeit in existence.  TPL, to the best of my knowledge, has never diluteda shareholder interest...has never given out stock to management oranyone else...ever!  What other company can make the same claim?Over time it has only reduced the share count and will continue to doso.  TPL can self finance new endeavors with cash! Never with debt.TPL does not estimate reserves or NPV's so waiting for the Trust todo so is pointless.  Do I wish TPL would provide more timely informationon its plans and strategies going forward.  Of course,   Regardless,there is one other point to consider.  The Trustees of TPL are requiredto work for the best interest of its shareholders.  How many corporationsare run for the best interest of its shareholders?  Mr. Boyd does notunderstand what TPL is, how it is managed, and what its potential valueis.  As an investor in TPL one has to work hard to figure out what it isand have an understanding of what it does.  For those of us who enjoydoing research it is fun.  Others will simply offer excuses as why it can'tbe done.  Should TPL have an EPS of around $40 this year (it might) Ithink $1200 is doable in 2019.  Sadly, I don't think we will get a chance to buy at less than $600 at any point for the rest of this year.  Mr. Boyd,could you give us your TPL price projections for the rest of 2019?",
"If the company sold land for $100mm, why would they want to do a like kind exchange.  I get the tax consequences, which are not insignificant, but this is supposed to be, after all, a liquidating trust.  I would think that the first option would be to repurchase stock. So, the question is, is there a message here that, given $100mm, they would rather do a like kind exchange rather than pay $25mm of taxes and repurchase stock with the rest?  If TPL is really so undervalued, shouldn't they be repurchasing their own stock instead of buying other land at market value?  Only other reason would be they are buying the new land at a huge discount to market, but why would that be likely?",

"Standing back and looking at it from a macro perspective, @Michael Boyd what do you think about the water business in the Permian over the next 20 years? In the article you valued the water business at a billion if I remember correctly, so what are your best guesses for 5 or 10 years from now on a low and high side? I am confident the water business will at least double in revenue in the next 5 years, and I do not think that a triple in revenue would be unreasonable for 10 years from now.  The stock price is currently around 2x which is where it was at when the water business was announced during the summer of 2017.  As far as predicting future oil & gas income, IMO a good way to estimate is by looking at Chevron and Anadarko.  Chevron has recently come out talking about how much they are going to expand in the permian and how they will be focusing a bulk of their CAPEX there in the next few years.  From 2014 to 2017, CVX has accounted for at least 25% of TPL's O&G income (25.40% in 2014, 30.80% in 2015, 25.70% in 2016 and 28.17% in 2017).  It was also at least over 20% from 1995 to 2000 (25.70% in 1995, 25.50% in 1996, 29.00% in 1997, 28.00% in 1998, 24% in 1999 and 20% in 2000). TPL's share from CVX in 2017 did include a lawsuit that was approximately $7 million of the total $15,100,000).",
"@IDRILL4GASOIL I believe that people are misunderstanding TPL when they speak of ""earnings"".  TPL is more like a government collecting taxes or the toll booth on the turnpike.  TPL simply collects for charges related to the use of its land and for what is pumped from it.  If you drive across their land, there is a charge.  If you put a pipe across it, there is a charge.  If you pump something (gas, oil, water) there is a charge (royalty).  If you feed your cattle on it, there is a charge.  (I am waiting until I have a better understanding what it is doing with the water; that might actually be a service performed by the trust.It does little, if anything, to make a product, provide a service, or invent something.  Looked at this  way, the question is how much in charges did it collect.  Since there are no earnings, a P/E ratio would not be applicable.  Earnings would fall into the same category.  It does not really have the ability to increase revenues by doing more work, or to reduce costs by shutting down a plant.Just a thought or two.",

"You say, ""... a large chunk of the total acreage on the balance sheet is surface acreage with no mineral or water rights.""  Then later in the article you say, "" Under Texas Pacific acreage lies a lot of this non-potable water, albeit under right of capture (meaning any owner that sits above a water reservoir can drain it dry).""  I believe your second statement is correct.  In Texas, the surface owner owns the ground water, including any water that can be reached with a shallow well, and there is no limit on how much water he can use or sell.  The produced water from an oil or gas well is a different matter.  The well operator owns it and has the responsibility to dispose of it in accordance with environmental regulations.  This produced water will be the source of much future revenue for TPL, which can collect a fee for the disposal service and then, after treatment to kill any microbes that could be harmful to petroleum, sell it to another operator for fracking.  In the future, they may collect more water than they can sell.  Fortunately TPL is blessed with a huge number of old depleting wells on their property, some of which can be converted into disposal wells.Your assumption of $45 oil invalidates the whole article.  The future always looks darkest at the bottom of a price crash, which is when you wrote this article.  A more realistic assumption would be that the price would rise to $90 WTI over two or three years.  Then you could calculate the present value of assets and revenues using assumed future prices which are more likely to rise and fall like a yo-yo than to stay at the bottom, which is how oil prices have always behaved in the past.  How do I know it was the bottom?  Of course I don't, but I assume it was because it was causing companies to reduce capex plans.",
"Here is a Houston Chronicle article on Chevron and the TX holdings they have:www.chron.com/...Note the infrastructure discussion:""Q: Chevron has large positions in both the Permian’s emerging Delaware Basin that extends into New Mexico and the more centralized Midland Basin. How would describe them?A: Both sub-basins are very strong. The best rocks do tend to be in the central part of each of them. I wouldn’t say erode, but the thickness of the shale and the number of benches do decrease as you move to the fringes of the basins. The Delaware tends to be gassier, but the production rates are higher. The gas has a lower value than the crude, but the total volume and recoveries tend to be higher. So it offsets some of that higher gas content with higher recoveries. There’s also surface and infrastructure considerations. The Delaware is more remote than the Midland — much more remote. So we’re still building out the power, the roads and takeaway infrastructure. There’s just much more infrastructure in the Midland-Odessa area than out in the Carlsbad, New Mexico and western West Texas area.""",

"Mr. Boyd, Thank you for the response.  I do not believe that anyone is bent out of shape over your analysis,  This forum is very civil and I appreciate any intelligent debate over differing views.  Your Bearcase assigns a value of $425 to TPL and the Bull case $506.45. SoI will give you credit as the stock fell to have hit and gone below yourBear case value.  However, yesterday TPL hit an intra-day high of $606which is nearly $100 over your Bull case of 506.45.  Someone followingyour advise may have taken your Bull case value as a sell point and wouldhave left $100 on the table.  My point is your model does not give us thebest point to sell.   My Bull case would take TPL up to $1500 over the nextfew years.  I will admit unless oil stays above $80 for an extended time I may have to adjust this.  I still think that even at $45-$50 oil TPL mayhit new all time highs within 2 years time.   What I think you are missingwith TPL is how vast of an area that TPL covers and what it means forthe share price in future years.  Also, I think you miss out the importanceof certain aspects of the Trust,,,especially what their buybacks mean tothe future share price.

Interesting that particular PE level seems to mark the bottompoint so consistently.  I cannot predict the price of oil, but I don't thinkTPL will trade under $409 in 2019.  Now a question for you, Mr. Boyd:   Assuming TPL does not fall below $409, at what price would TPL   have to hit, in order for you to admit that your analysis is flawed?As much as many people on this board have indicated that they wouldwant TPL to provide more detailed information, the info they need isnot known.  To understand what TPL's value is takes ""abstract reasoning""which is simply having a concept of what is taking place on, around, andunder TPL's lands.  My own ""focus"" has been on Culberson, Reeves, andLoving counties.  These are the ""key"" to find out what is going on.  Longstory short, production on these TPL lands will continue to grow for at leastthe next 5 years, water services will continue to grow, the price of oil & gaswill be unknown.  The oil wells in the above counties may be among the lowest cost oil in the US today....if not the world.  The Permian will continueto produce oil & gas for as long as it has value to humankind.",
"This valuation notably lacks any appreciation for growth. This applies to all business lines; the Delaware basin has only just begun to be developed and limitations in pipelines, work crews and capital budgets prevent a full development even had oil prices not corrected. Ergo, a static multiple on today’s figures is quite misleading (and consequently would place about the entire NASDAQ composite at a wild overvaluation). The royalty “comps” being used are generally in highly depleted oil fields and in high decline.Fundamentally, it’s easiest to analyze the oil royalties. Placing an NAV only on producing + DUCs, relative to current drilling and CVX/broader Delaware 2023 forecasts (> 3x current levels) excludes perhaps 80% of the full value of the assets. Extending these projections to commensurate growth on water and easements provides similar revisions to these NAVs.While growth must be considered, so to must an eventual decline and exhaustion of the resource. Even related to full buildout, it’s a 20+ year resources based only on current technology and the highest quality shale.",

"Thank you for the article about TPL Michael - I enjoyed reading it. I'll be the first to admit that I have a case of confirmation bias with TPL and welcome perspectives that would challenge my bullish views on it. I will say that I'm still Long TPL and believe that it is way undervalued. A question I have for you and anyone else out there that knows a sufficient amount about accounting to answer this. My question relates to the ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" on the 10-Q.  Specifically, this one:""In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU requires lessees to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. The new guidance will also require significant disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842” that clarifies the application of the new lease guidance to land easements. The ASU allows an optional transition practical expedient, which if elected, would not require an entity to reassess the accounting treatment on existing or expired land easements not previously accounted for as leases under the current lease guidance. Any new or modified land easements would be evaluated under the new lease guidance upon adoption of the new lease standard. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” and ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842) — Targeted Improvements” to set forth certain additional practical expedients for lessors and to provide entities with an option to adopt the new lease standard with a cumulative effect at the adoption date without restating prior periods. The new lease standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which for the Trust is the first quarter of 2019. The Trust plans to adopt the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 with a cumulative effect at the adoption date. While the assessment of the impact this ASU will have on the consolidated financial statements is ongoing, the Trust does expect to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability for our operating lease commitments on the consolidated balance sheet, but does not expect a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows.""  Does this mean that the 10-Q and other filings will have to have a lot more detailed information regarding the specifics of the easement income? I am curious about how much will actually be disclosed and how it will impact the valuation.  Any ideas on what we could expect from this and if it will be significant enough to where it could significantly alter how the market values it?",

I have Kimbell for my oil royalties.  1099s now.Dave,
"The author dose not understand what TPL is or how it is run.TPL is a trust that is run for the benefit of its shareholders. Themandate is to buy back and cancel shares  as well as to paydividends. TPL never issues new stock to anyone except if astock split is declared.  TPL's royalty lands are ""perpetualnon-participating""  which means royalties are good foreverand in order to collect the Trust never has to put up any money.Some of the surface and royalty lands are located in areas thatmay be among the most valuable in the Permian.  The full servicewater business may produce substantial revenues over timewhich will ultimately contribute towards buybacks an dividends.Over the last decade, TPL has traded at a PE ratio from 15-63.Recently, TPL traded close to but did not hit a PE of 15.  (Basedon my estimate of $26 EPS for 2018.)  TPL will move up and downmainly with the price of oil.  Should oil recover to $80 or higher Ibelieve a share price of $1500 would be in the cards.  For thosecorporations that contribute the highest revenues for TPL...thegame plan is to produce more oil & gas volumes (at a lower cost.)This will create more demand for water services for TPL.  Theauthor is correct in that TPL does not report estimated reservesor how many active wells they have.  Much of what can be knownabout TPL is from learning what their client companies do, and byactually reading the 10-Q's and 10-K's yourself.  TPL has been aroundsince 1888 and only in the last few years have they hit the big time...My guess is that over the next decade TPL makes it to at least $2000.",
"I think this was a really good article and I for years wished management would give us more information, but eventually I concluded that the reason they do not give out information to get more people interested is that they are trying to buy the stock back and technically liquidate, so doing investor presentations that would tend to drive the price of the stock up would be against their trust declaration to buy back stock.In the old days just a few years ago they were buying over two percent per year, and in a low interest rate environment that wasn't too bad. The investments in the water business and the really high share price seemed to have slowed that down, hopefully temporarily.Because the author is correct about the prices paid for royalty companies because of the obvious cash flow analysis I have long argued against much of a dividend increase, and have always felt the stock buyback over time is much more lucrative, and does goose the P/E.I completely agree the land is only worth 400-500 per acre in absence of the oil business. Drive east out of El Paso and you wouldn't really want the land nor conclude it is worth much. The laughable lease rates prove that and I always figured they leased it just so someone would tend the land a little for free, so to speak.The land is extremely difficult to value with the massive activity occuring in the area, though.I wouldn't say it is all worth 7500 per acre, but some certainly is - no way to know though a case could definitely be made for Murray Stahl to hire someone to figure it out.The reason I have held onto it for all these years is the massive amounts of oil out there. I've made calculations and put those comments on this board and it is reasonable though not guaranteed that potential royalties in the future will be worth several thousand dollars per share (what TPL calls a sub share for historical reasons) based upon today's dollars, and the land and oil will definitely be an inflation hedge against a falling dollar, too. The pipelines being installed will create a takeaway capacity that will surpass the Ghawar Field in Saudi Arabia, making the Permian potentially the biggest oil field in the world. TPL will be in on that action. It is completely impossible to nail the valuation on this stock for these reasons and so I would recommend caution just like the author advises, but I personally find this stock more compelling than any other on the NYSE.I think the author has a fair evaluation here based upon solid investment type analysis. It is hard to know what percentage of the 1/16 royalty lands are untapped, but I think it is really low because Chevron has basically sat on their Permian properties up until a few years ago.So for me the growth story is still there, perhaps considerably more growth to even overcome the high hurdle of the excellent 2018 results in a low oil price environment.If more people get interested in this stock, and the trading volume goes up, it would also qualify for the S & P 500 if the market cap also rises some more, and that would get more institutions into the stock, creating more upward pressure.",
"@Michael Boyd @Steven Miller I think that the land valuation needs to be reconsidered.  Apache Corp. (APA) went out three or four years ago and picked up some 1,600,000 acres in Alpine High, which is located in the Permian.  These acres were obtained before the discovery of how great Alpine High is.  It is my understanding that the acreage was picked up for something like $2,500 per acre; the land is now worth a tremendous amount more than that.  I would submit that valuing the land at range land prices significantly undervalues it.  Although I have not been able to overlay TPL's lands with APA's, I would submit that they are probably close enough to use them for comps.  The 21,000 acres TPL sold for $100,000 would also value the land at significantly more than $400 acre rangeland.Just a thought or two.",
"This is one of those stocks that can have a very wide range of values depending on your assumptions and time horizon.  It's an operationally levered play on oil, but not just at the current price but for the next 20-30 years, at least.  If you are bullish on oil, this is a great play.  If you're bearish on oil, it's not.  I suspect that there are only a handful of people who know what this company could be worth under a variety of scenarios.  One of those is (or should be) management.  It will be interesting to see how many shares they repurchased in this decline.  The other person is Murray Stahl.  If I owned as much as he did, I would be hiring experts to pore through the land records and really understand all the acreage they own and its potential.  No one else really has the incentive to do this.  It's hard to value a company when there is so little information.",

Does the Author have an answer to this 'new information'?www.sec.gov/..._____________________________On November 21, 2018, Texas Pacific Land Trust (the “Trust”) entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Sale Agreement”), pursuant to which the Trust agreed to sell approximately 14,000 surface acres of land in Loving and Reeves Counties, Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000,000 (the “Sale”) as may be adjusted based on the terms and conditions of the agreement. The Sale excludes any mineral interest in the lands to be conveyed.The Sale is subject to a number of closing conditions, including the buyer’s due diligence investigation and option to reduce the acreage to be conveyed by as much as 1,920 acres with a corresponding reduction of the purchase price. The Sale Agreement contains standard representations and warranties related to each party, and may be terminated prior to the closing under certain circumstances.

Come on, at least post that where one owns 1/16th Royalty, they get 1/16 or 6.25% of the Revenue, while on 1/128th Royalty Acreage one gets 1/128 or 0.781%!  How the heck can we say these are the 'same acres' or values?  At least divide the 1/128th Royalty Acres by 8, to convert this to 1/16th Royalty, then add the two!

"Other than the long history dating back to the late 1880s, I don't understand why TPL is valued so high relative to others like AMR. To me, it seems like this company enjoys the luxury of old money. The company doesn't seem to be very agile but I guess the time value of money has played a role here.",
"Thanks for the article, Michael, as well as the mention. You've given us a different perspective and some things to chew on. At least, you've given me some things to chew on. I'll need some time to think through some of the things you brought up, but here is some initial feedback.First, I have not ever been completely comfortable with using EPS to value the Trust, but I probably did not state that very clearly in the article you referenced. I looked at EPS there because the market is probably looking at it, and it is a likely culprit for the recent share price drop. You are right that ""Historically, a greater proportion of value was attributable to high value, but low income, surface acreage."" It wasn't until the Andarko discovery that the view began to shift. There are a number of bulls commenting on my previous articles that still are focused more on the oil in the ground than the current EPS. It's a tricky balance addressing both that audience and the audience looking at EPS.Second, I've talked about the slowing/negative ""comps"" in at least two articles, somewhat to the displeasure of some. Seeking Alpha readers, at least, should not be surprised at flat comps the first half of 2019. The real question in my mind is what the comps will be when the new pipelines open starting in the second half of 2019. The thought I'm seeing from some is that a lot of those DUCs will be put into production at that time. If so, the Trust should be earning more by sheer volume of increased supply. But since demand is projected to go up only incrementally, will the extra supply bring down pricing? So far I have not found anyone willing to make a projection.The one item that sticks out to me is not pricing in natural gas. The last time I looked, revenue from that was significant. However, that was awhile ago, and you may be correct given current pricing. I'd like to be convinced one way or the other.",
"I think you will be blown away by the easement SWD income in future. I don't own TPL but I own land in west Texas. For instance, one small plot in Reeves was worth about $40k about 5 years ago. Lat year someone offered me $200k. I have received over $100k in easement money in last few months and am negotiating SWD well that could bring in ~$50k/month. With the massive amount of pipeline and SWD that will have to happen as shale is fully exploited I would imagine that TPL will have huge income.",
"Let me help with a set of facts that must be accounted for in the analysis.1. According to the EPA the Permian in Nov. is producing at 3.632 MMbopd not including 3866 DUCs wells.  Expected to grow to 3.9MMbopd in 2019 EIA and according to IHS Markit outlook 5.4 MMbopd in 2023.TPL has 308 or so DUCs (8% of total) many in the heart of the new long laterals.  What do you think will happen to YPLs production?  Do the math.2. Laterals grew from 1,500 to 7,500ft at the end of 2017.  This year 4,500 to 10,500ft some up now to 15,000ft.What do you think this will do for production?3. In June Boomburg reported crude output had grown 25% in the Permiam in the last year.What kind of impact will this have on TPLs production?4.  TPL just sold 14,000 acres for over $7,000 per.What do you think the impact will be on TPLs surface land?5. The cost of water management in the Permium is expected to double to $22 Billion in the next 5 years according to IMS MarkitWhat do you think the impact of this will be on TPLs water business?6.  Lastly Woods Mackenzie found that the Wolfcamp production is losing 15% annually after 5 years.  Now this is just the Woldcamp and only in certain areas.   The bottom line is we do not have in many areas enough production data to make one size fits all projections because some of the wells are actually increasing in production after 120 days of being on line.I think you for your analysis but there is data that suggests that you value projections may be missing new data and changes in the environment that is having a drastic impact on the value of TPLs whole business portfolio.",
The base thesis is the land rises with inflation and all else is earnings above that.,
"Hi Michael, thank you for this article. I think there is sometimes confirmation bias among TPL investors so this is a welcome source of discussion. The one disconnect I see is regarding your surface acreage valuation. TPL recently disclosed in an SEC filing that they sold 14k surface acres for $100mm (~$7k an acre and scheduled to close in Q1 2019). I see that you based the price per acre off of the Texas Rural Lands report, which is valuing the land based on what a farmer would pay for it. I am wondering if this is the correct barometer? Your assumption that the land is worth ~$400/acre may be true if the prospective buyer is a farmer, but it seems like the land is much more valuable to major Oil companies.",
"Seems like most of those who fear a quarter or yoy flat to down sold out this quarter since it already happened qoq. Anyway, if it does better owners will result.",
Well that is why they call it a market. Admittedly this stock is hard to value but a couple points that are important for the bulls on this stock.  The delaware portion of the permian basin is widely acknowledged to have the highest reserves and oil in place of any non conventional oilfield. It is probably the most economical play available. Some project that production will triple by 2025.  It might be the biggest oilfield in the world. Chevron will double production by 2023 and much of it will be tpl property.  Tpl owns a bunch of land that will sell or rent for lots of money. They own a lot of road frontage on 285 from the state line down through orla that is basically ground zero for the boom. I value the land in the aggregate closer to 2000 per acre.  Some people think the royalties will add up to 2-3000 dollars per share over time. So what is the discounted value of that over time.  As i said before this is a difficult stock to value. Its like hoe much is the net present value of the google search engine or maps. You have to believe and understand the economics of the play. Personally it is the only stock i own where i dont mind if it goes down. They can buy more shares and i own more acreage in the biggest oilfield in the world. Jmho as they say,

"Good stuff Michael. Thanks. I am little confused by the ""With well decline rates in the Permian averaging in the 15% range on an annual basis, Texas Pacific Land Trust would need to see (at least) 25-35 DUCs converted to production per year just to keep production flat.""I see that in the link as well. What exactly is this decline rate referencing is what I am not sure about.Permian base decline rate is estimated to be 236,000 barrels/day every month on a 3.75 million barrel/day production www.eia.gov/...or 6.29% per month and in the 60% range  annually.

"It's almost magical how on expiration Friday's TLRY closes at the nearest round price causing the maximum number of puts and calls to expire worthless. 70 was the number for today based on the Jan 4 open interest.I couldn't resist selling more puts and even buying some shares at 69.10 when I saw the interest jumped from 200% earlier today to 500% again. IB cuts me in on half the borrow rate which translates to 250%, or a daily interest rate of .7%, weekends included. Just holding it over the weekend nets me 2%. I even wonder if the MM's manipulate the interest rate to make it too costly to borrow and not incidentally forcing shorts to become buyers on a Friday afternoon to avoid the weekend borrow (too late actually since the fees work on a T+3 basis meaning you would have had to cover on Tues but who knows that)?I'm as bearish as anyone about this crap stock but there's way too much money bet against it in the nearterm.

There's a lot of money on the MM side, the options writers, riding on keeping TLRY elevated into expiration. They make far more money on worthless puts than they do on worthless calls right now. Plus the super high demand to borrow shares has pushed the fee back over 200% on IB again. So there's a lot of ways to profit off of retail shorts buying the news as it were. This last Friday was a perfect illustration of why if you're buying puts you should trade out of them at least a day before their expiration; around mid-day TLRY suddenly shot up 3.00 to close a smidge above 75.00 and magically a ton of puts expired worthless. Today, Monday, TLRY immediately reversed its Friday gain almost as if there has been no reason for it other than to benefit the MM's.

It's not supposed to be that easy to make money on the markets.I think the only smart trade now is to sell naked puts. There's no money is selling naked calls, 200% to borrow the stock is insane, but a Jan 18 ATM (71.0) put sells for about 13.00.

"This article needs to be updated. Electrek, a Tesla lapdog website , run by a true believer in global warming junk science *( I doubt that Lambert could answer a single question posed by a skeptic) has reported 3300 unsold Model 3 cars in inventory and Tesla has now gone beyond leasing discounts to just plain discounts - $5000 autopilot upgrades for free, $7,000 interior uprgades for free, etc. Funny how Tesla can claim hundreds of thousands of folks with $1000 deposits on the Model 3 waiting list and yet even up to $13,000 in discounts cannot persuade 3300 to place their order. Tesla is now accepting days off and vacation pay from their employees to buy. Also obsolete is the remark about Jaguar I Pace - it has now outsold both the Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X by almost two to one in Holland, and it is the main reason that Tesla sales fell an astounding 40% in Norway. The I Pace has been collecting dozens of awards - far more than any Tesla ever received as Car of the Year, Best EV, etc. And the Porsche electric Taycan had upped its planned production schedule due to extraordinarilly high demand from 25,000 to roughly 50,000 in its first year - equal to the combined production of the Tesla Model S and Model X. Porsche announced the other day that the first year's production has been sold out and that a large portion of the buyers were Tesla owners.    Awhile back, a Teslabull wrote an article on Seeking Alpha which claimed that Tesla would not face any significant competition for more than a year. Aside from the fact that the Jaguar I Pace is acting very much like one of those supposed non-existent Tesla  killers, the fallacy of that Tesla bull's argument was that is assumes a car has to be available in a showroom before it can affect Tesla sales. The Porsche Taycan is not due for delivery much before 2020, yet obseve its great impact on Tesla sales. Those saes of Tesla cars represent a majorr investment for most buyers and they will check out every alternative before laying down that much cash. This is especially true when they see large numbers of awards and very positive reviews of Tesla competitors, who come from very established automakers with excellent reputations and realize that Tesla's one-time superiority in driving ranges, acceleration, battery recharge speeds are gone and often inferior. Even  their Supercharger network is now being eclipsed by the CCS networks, which will service practically every electric car , andobvioulsy will be located in hundreds of times more locations.  The new entrants are aslo often more attractive vehicles with interiors far superior to Tesla's, which remind one of a computer nerd at work.",

As Usual these articles are like clockwork when they see pivot point in the stock price.Anyways you will continue to ignore all demand outside of America. Btw Tesla is only selling cars in 26 states so tell your senators to open up the other 25 would help out a lot!,
"Anton -I appreciate your skill as an analyst, and looking strictly at financials I could see where you can easily support a short thesis based on valuation.  I get it.  But I also think that as an analyst it can be hard to see a company that is ""outside the box"", which I believe is where the short thesis for Tesla lies.  I own a Tesla, but I've also owned a Nissan Leaf and the BMW i3.  As a vehicle the Tesla is far and away a better car in every way.  But that's not why Tesla owners are avid about the company.  The primary distinguishing feature that Tesla offers is the SuperCharger network.  That's why I own a Tesla because I can drive my car wherever I want and know that I'll be able to get to my destination and back home.  Until other car manufacturers have a reliable charging network Tesla will fend off all challengers.  Add to that free over the air updates (no need to go to a service center), almost no annual maintenance (wiper blades, tire rotation?), and greatly improved quality control (not perfect, but far better than a year ago), the cars are hard to fault.Yes, the loss of Tax Credits is a big deal, but maybe less of a big deal than many think.  Even without the tax credit the M3 that I bought was comparably priced, and even a bit lower priced, than a comparably equipped BMW 3 series that I own.  I decided to replace that car when I purchased the Tesla.  Simply put the M3 Tesla was more fun, to me, than the BMW 3 series.  And if it costs the same without rebates, all the better.  Even more attractive is the M3 Performance model.  That car without autopilot, but with the premium interior and 300+ mile range lists at $64,000 before shipping and taxes.  A comparably equipped BMW M4 is more expensive by thousands of dollars and doesn't perform as well.  Yes, there are limits to a battery powered car, to many that isn't as important as the benefits.  Finally, as many have pointed out, Tesla still has lots of runway in Europe and China.  They may indeed need a capital infusion in 2019, but that will be directed to new products and strengthening the SuperCharging network.  The timeframe for Tesla to fail seems pretty limited.  So the question becomes - ""Is your analysis based on current and future trends, or are you overly attached to your initial short bias, which may indeed have been relevant at the time?""",
"IMO, Tesla is exchanging an expiring lease committment where most of the profit has already been realized, for a new lease on a new vehicle, which will increase continued profits out into the future. Since Tesla's hold their value well, any reserve contingency that has been booked for the estimated residual value of the car at lease expiration versus its actual market value, will be minimized.The strategy also locks the consumer into being loyal to Tesla for the next 3-5 years, instead of giving them the opportunity to look around at the competition offerings. As far as I am concerned, the lease pull forward is just a great example of a sound business strategy. This tells me a lot about the flexibility and resourcefullness of the Tesla management team when working in a competitive eonomic environment where worldwide growth is slowing. This is one of the reasons why Tesla has been able to survive and flourish when many pundits have expected them to cease to exist by now. They are a fast moving and very resourceful bunch and is the type of management that is required to be successful going forward.Additionally, I do not agree with the author that any promotion of this type should be accounted as a part of Tesla COGS for the following reasons:Deriving revenues through the leasing model typically involves three parties: the seller, the buyer (lessee) and the financier (lessor).In exchange for payment, ownership of an item (usually equipment) is transferred from the seller to the lessor. ( key point- ownership is transferred from Tesla to the lessor).The lessee then contracts with the lessor for the use of the item in exchange for a periodic fee. The seller may or may not retake ownership of the item once the leasing contract has ended. In Tesla's case they are both the seller and lessor, assuming they do not utilize outside financiers to carry the lease paper with the lessee. This is the reason that many manufacturing companies will establish a wholly or partially owned subsidiary to act as the financier in a typical lease contract. (Think GE Capital for example.) Or they will simply contract with an outside financing company to provide lease contracts with their customers and transfer the title and financial risks and rewards of leasing capital equipment to others.From an accounting perspective, it is clear to me that the ""discount"" transaction the author is referrring to is not a discount at all on the books of Tesla. This is due to the fact that there are 3 entities involved with the leasing model. Seller (Tesla), buyer (lessee)  and financier (lessor). These are 3 separate entities for accounting purposes.The seller does not sell the auto directly to the consumer but rather to the lessor. The lessor has full rights to the auto at that time including leasing the auto to others and rights to the residual value after the lease contract expires. The auto is titled in the name of the Lessor. The seller books the auto subject to this arrangement as a sale on its books and depending upon the arrangement with the financier, may or may not book a contingent liability on its books for any difference between residual value ( which establshes the lease payment amount) and the actual value of the asset at lease expiration, that may have been agreed upon or not.At any rate, it is a SALE on the books of the manufacturer. The gross proceeds recieved by Tesla from the lessor will dictate the amount to be booked on their books as revenue less any additional costs of the sale as is normal. Accounting for this transaction as a sale on the manufacturer books is proper since all of the rewards and risks of the asset has been transferred to the financier (the leasing company) via title. The ownership of the financing arm is irrelevant as to its accounting treatment on the books of the manufacturer. If Tesla retains full or partial ownership of the financing arm as a subsidiary, those numbers will come out in the wash for the consolidated books.IMO, Tesla does not want to absorb these lease committments  as a part of their overall organization going forward (i.e. financing arm subsidiary), due to the cash implications of having to carry the lease paper with the lessee. They should not worry about passing up the opportunity to earn leasing profits from their consumers, since there are large risks to be incurred as well. Especially as the worldwide economy slows down. They really need to focus on outright sales of their products to consumers while adding the additional flexibility of providing lease financing to its customers through a relationship with an external leasing company. This will allow them to intently focus on developing additional demand for their product while letting others reap the gains or losses of the leasing business.Not that they care much about my opinion. Especially since it somewhat conflicts with their concept of a vertical integration business model.My 2 cents....",
Long Tesla!,
Tesla is running out of ideas to trick people to buy the high priced golf carts,
"@Anton Wahlman Yes, Tesla truly is ""stuffing"" this quarter. They will pay for it later, though. Q1 looks to be more than a bit rough.",
"Longs should not miss this change to the narrative. After repeating the mantra of endless demand, Tesla is now engaging in common promotional tactics. This cannot be a “so what” to longs. A sale today displaces a sale in 2019, and it should impact prices and margins. The accounting will also be opaque to investors, and the pull forward can be handled differently, but is prob not good. An influx of new lease returns will pressure used values, which will in turn raise lease rates. But the genius of Tesla is that it all gets kicked down the road. Losses on lease returns will likely be booked to “goodwill.”",
"Not sure about M3 sales to any part of Europe that is member of EU. I read yesterday that Eu Homologation has not yet been obtained. Without this, the M3 cannot be sold in any EU member state. Is this already in progress, does anyone know? How long will it take Tesla to get this type approval?The other brands will already have it",
"TESLA will shortly announce they will pick up the $3750 tax difference for 2019 buyers, but that payment won't be eligible until 2020 when the person can prove they would have been eligible for the full amount. Kick the can down the road another year.",
"It is obvious that Tesla is trying to maximize sales in Q4 any which way. I have not looked at the income statement losses so far for 2018, wouldn’t it be the shocker of the year if they made a $1 profit for all of 2018. That would kill the short thesis! And the stock would go above $400.This announcement would take place just before the March stock for debt conversion date...the higher the stock price, the less cash Tesla has to pay for the March debt. Remember they said they will use stock/cash combination.GM and Ford are downright boring in so many ways...they have only one way to go...down. Sorry for being blunt.",
"Hey Anton!Your short thesis is sure getting a lot weaker, which makes me, even more, Uber(pun-intended) bullish on TSLA!You attend ""new vehicle launches, press conferences, and industry events"", with free hotel and F&B paid by the companies trying to play ""catch-up"" to Tesla or be disrupted, possibly even put out-of-business.Of the ""Kia Niro EV: Early January; Kia Soul EV (230 mile range version): April; Audi eTron: January; Nissan LEAF (230 mile range version): June; and Mercedes EQC: June in Germany"", without even looking at these new offerings, I would guess that the Kia and Leaf are ugly and wouldn't bother to check them out. Personally, the Kia and Leaf brands don't appeal to me and never did before Tesla, either. I used to drive Mercedes, starting with my 1983 380sl Roadster, which I still own. Audi is made by the criminal Volkswagen enterprise, so I would not consider that, either. I would take a look at EQC and compare the specs to Tesla.As far as buying out the customer's lease for customer loyalty that is standard in the industry among Mercedes, BMW, and the rest. I did that with some of my Benz's, too, so it is no big deal that Tesla is also smart to do it. Remember, Teslas have higher resale values than all the others. Tesla gets a new sale at high margin, plus they get the lease return back 5-6 months early to re-sell. On 9/28/2018, I returned a 2016 Model X P90D early that was due 3/28/2019. It saved me ~$12K in monthly payments (including sales tax). I bought a new Model 3 Dual Motor when the Performance model I was supposed to get was unavailable. Tesla still did the ownership loyalty deal with me, saving me $11K for Dual Motor instead of Performance. Doing things like that to accommodate your customer when you make a mistake is fantastic goodwill and builds a customer relationship for life, not just with me, but with my son and relatives, too. One of my cousins and her husband just bought ""hers and his"" Model 3's, for example. My 66 y/o DDS friend bought a Model 3 exactly like mine last weekend. I even let her test drive MY CAR so she would qualify for the 3-day return policy by not test driving Tesla's car. I spent several hours with her teaching her how to use the touchscreen and drive her EV. Would I have done that back in the day if she bought a Mercedes from a stealership after she saw mine? Are you kidding? No Way!!What you and the other TSLA bears always fail to appreciate is the extremely high customer engagement and support of the Tesla Brand, and the viral nature of Tesla sales. Tesla is recognized as the clear technological leader in EV's with an eccentric genius named Elon at the helm. Now we also have Larry on the BOD with his ~$1B in stock -- totally aligned with shareholder's interests. 2019 will be a banner year for TSLA, no matter when the Model 3's arrive en masse on Europe's shores. I predict that TSLA will trade above $450 sometime in 2019 and may even reach $500/share by the end of the year. There are multiple catalysts that will move the stock higher next year.",
How can one believe that Tesla doesnot give discount? See this list:teslainventory.teslastats.no/...  In the netherlands we have more than 300 cars of Tesla with a discount in the inventory..,
"All promotions are marketing expenses. Every marketer on the planet knows this. weak FUD argument.Anton has been claiming tesla- competition-is-coming for over a year now. Every claim so far has been wrong. Just as I wrote in previous articles all the demand from these competitors are coming from their own existing custoners. Tesla takes more from other brands than they lose back to those brands. Nobody wants a Nissan or a Chevy or a Hyundai. These are not high loyalty brands, they are price shopped value brands. People want Tesla's or Mercedes or Porsche, but the latter don't have any offerings matching a model 3 and they will have to be rich to afford the Taycan. People don't buy ICE jags right now now and they will sell just as few ipace because it's still a jaguar.",

"In fact, I think the market cap for tesla makes  perfect sense - it is a high tech company not an auto company.",
"Accounting for the lease payments is not as simple as you imply. By taking back a leased car in December versus June, Tesla gets the car six months earlier, six months newer and with lower mileage, therefore higher value. That has to be offset against the loss of six months lease payments.The bigger impact is that Tesla sells a new car now, but loses a sale in June, and the taxpayer gets stiffed for an extra $3,750.It is a desperate move to keep the growth story alive, and it will come back to bite them later",
Fundamentally the market cap of this stock does not make sense relative to any other capital intensive car company.   Just another reason for Longs to be careful and prudent with allocating too much capital to this name.   Thanks for the contribution,
It's long past time for the wheels to come off this bus...,
I don’t own Tesla Stock but I do own a Model S. Honestly the competition are light years behind and there is just no comparison. Driving a tesla delights you. Yes even if its a lowly Model 3.

(""the Company"" or ""Mountainstar"") wishes to disclose material facts that the British Columbia Securities Commission (""the BCSC"") and Barrick Gold Corporation (""Barrick"") are required to report from 2016 to date as they face Trial versus Jorge R. Lopehandia at the 5th Civil Court of Santiago de Chile. Barrick and the BCSC must pay Lopehandia for libeling his correctly contracted business in accordance to the mining laws of Chile, with Mountain-West Resources Inc. - TSX and Mountainstar - CNSX. On January 18, 2019, an order was issued by the 5th Civil Court of Santiago against the BCSC and Barrick Gold Corp. to answer charges brought forward by Jorge Lopehandia in his ongoing ""live trial"" versus the BCSC employees regulating Mountainstar, Barrick and its regulators and parties involved. A ""live trial"" is a legal process offered in Napoleonic Code countries in order to arrive to the absolute legal truth. Charged, ordered to attend, and absent from the Trial in Chile since 2018, are the BCSC employees, Romolo di Fonzo and Roy Leon, who did not attend by January 10, 2018 when called to stand Trial in Chile. By not answering the international institutional serving of Mr. Lopehandia, both the BCSC employees accepted legal charges as is. Validation of the Jorge R. Lopehandia serving of the International Subpoena to the BCSC, the Institution named, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Chile May, 2018. A new order to the BCSC and Barrick to counter the charges is set... January 30, 2019... and it will be paid by BC taxpayers and Barrick public money, as undisclosed legal expenses. Mountainstar objects to these questionable civil servants and publicly traded company evasive legal actions. Hidden material facts by Barrick and the BCSC have hindered the investment profits of Mountianstar's shareholders from day one. The BCSC had the legal onus to accept the ruling of Chilean Court system by suspending the July 10, 2018 Hearing. The BCSC, the charged Institution represented by the named employees;  ought to answer questions as to their involvement in the Lopehandia/Barrick/BCSC litigation. The BCSC named employees at the Chilean Trials have jeopardized the legal stance of governments of BC, Ontario, and of Canada, by involving in the defense documents presented for and on behalf of the BCSC in Chile, the Ministry of Finance of BC and thereby the Ministry of Finance of Ontario as responsible party or parties, for the illegal financial activity of their respective exchange regulators, as already discovered and ordered in the Mina Pascua Chile, live trial. Mountainstar Gold Inc.

Mountainstar challenges the BCSC and Barrick to be legally compliant as they have spent public money in legal defense abroad and negated the public the corresponding material facts 2016 - 2019.

Emerson's current share valuations are restrained. They reflect the .5 cent per quarter, annual dividend increases that have improved Emerson's balance-sheet while at the same time disillusioning the long term DGI investors who had come to expect higher 'Total Shareholder Returns', since 2015. For me, Emerson is a secure Large-Cap, Multinational, diversified, hi-tech, electronics & automation industrial conglomerate, with safe financial metrics and a strong upside that together are collectively undervalued. Few industrial stocks are perceived to be worth going through a Recession holding. Emerson feels like one. They haven't had to grow their dividends faster than their growth rates while purchasing their inflated shares in buybacks to support their bloated share valuations, like MMM. Albeit, Emerson does ""Share Buybacks"", just not as much or as overvalued as its peers. Nevertheless, MMM is a fantastic company that everyone wants to hold shares of. Unfortunately, MMM's secure dividend increase record that still has dividends growing at >10% annually has current yields falling because as times go on more investors are chasing after MMM, just like they are after Microsoft and they were after Apple, the latter has taken a real beating of late despite still being capitalized for >$800 billion, like Microsoft.It's also the ""Dividend King"" status of MMM that keeps shareholders seeking it, even now, as share prices have twice toppled from lofty peaks twice in 2018. Emerson, however, is a 'Dividend King' too. With a substantially higher yield than MMM - at the present that could correct back toward historic norms in the case of a Recession, Emerson looks like a rare defensive industrial pick. The Reasons They Are Dividend KingsSpeaking of Multinational, 'Dividend Kings', from the industrial sector, that pay a higher yield than MMM, and who have taken a defensive position -- there's always Dover! Dover has recently 'spun-off' their Upstream Oil & Gas Services sector - 'Apergy', 'APY' from the parent company and gave shares to shareholders (1 'APY' for 2 'DOV'), and tied almost $1 billion 💰 debt to the new creation born of an old subsidiary. The dividends apparently stayed with Dover as Apergy pays none. Nevertheless, Dover has paid done some debt in an attempt like Emerson's, to de-leverage themselves. So Dover only added 1 cent to their quarterly dividend despite increasing annually for 60 consecutive years. Both companies are well prepared for a weakening economy and will likely weather the storm much better than their peers.",

Mycroft Friedrich... Thank you for the cool and thorough math explanations. This is why I enjoy Seeking  Alpha. It's people like you and others that teach novice investors to be better investors. I've always looked at a companies debt and assets. And where things are trending in a companies industry.,
And the answer is you should sell your GE shares in 2008 as I did. GE is a complex turnaround and management has shown no brilliance as of yet. I would not touch it with a very long barge pole. I used the same barge pole for IBM.,

With GE at 6.76 I wonder if DB will issue a Buy rating :-),
There have been so many comments that I'm taking the liberty of repeating myself. Only 1.5 of the float has been sold short. This is far less than one would expect with a troubled company. Why? Is it possible that potential short sellers are just as much in the dark about GE future as everyone else?,
I was recently involved in an inheritance of stock issue.  The beneficiary’s unit cost becomes the price of the stock on the day the owner dies.  In my case the stock had greatly appreciated when the owner died so it was a boon for the beneficiary as there was little if any capital gains to tax.,
I know one thing for sure.Any hourly aviation employee has made more profit for Ge than Jeff Immelt or his cronies ever have.,
none of this sell-buy-hold matters. when you inherit stock you are inheriting X amount of dollar value. what is the highest and best use of that free money in their life? if they haven't been following the hum about GE? they probably aren't. very ready to be in the market. cash in baby.,
What possible reason could there be to still be holding GE? Turbines falling apart just like the entire business. The answer to the old question of how low can it go is always zero.,
"Quoting a larger accuracy for a measure while quoting a large error probability at the same time is disingenuous. Anyone who is familiar with statistical hypothesis testing would realize that there is something wrong with the statement. Generally if the accuracy goes up the false alarm( in this case the probability that bankruptcy is predicted but does not occur) goes down. If that isn’t true, then something else has changed. Too much is unknown to take that statement seriously. Probably the population of companies is significantly different. The indicated statement indicates that the variances around the distributions must be large in the later stated statistic. Also don’t understand the quoting two numbers like 80 to 90% percent accurate. People who use the quoting of statistics to advance a conclusion should know the assumptions and limitations of the measure before putting too much stock in it.",

"Interesting article.  The algorithm is highly suspect, these kinds of calculations are really subject to a number of problems, the least of which is probably failure to properly calculate the compounding error of the factors involved.    I would also be suspicious of confirmation bias and selection bias here.  Has this algorithm been run on the hundreds of companies that have failed over the last decade and for which statistics are no longer easily available?    The authors of such algorithms look really hard for examples that confirm their calculations--but that is not science, even though it may sound scientific.   Scientists do experiments in order to disprove theories.   How much time did the author spend looking for companies where the algorithm doesn't work?   If someone claims that there is an acceleration due to gravity, scientists focus all their attention on trying to disprove it.  Experiments are designed to demonstrate that the fundamental theory is wrong.   After a while and consistent failure to disprove the theory,  it becomes accepted, but the work to disprove it or find exceptions never ends.  When people put forward investing algorithms and can demonstrate that they have spend a significant amount of time and energy looking for examples that disprove the algorithm (and when they can demonstrate that others have also attempted to prove the algorithm wrong and failed), then I might be tempted to take a look--but I am not impressed in the least with a list of examples where the algorithm worked--that evidence is of no value.Having said that, the ""conclusion"" of this article and the algorithm seems not to be earthshaking to me.  The only people who support GE seem to be people who own a boatload of stock with a much higher cost basis and are just plain hoping and praying for some miracle to help them out.",

At this price basis, if I am holding with a significantly high price basis (assumed as stock was inherited), I respectfully disagree.

If you booked a loss that high, you need to be really good to recover that and make profit with the way the market is going. There are very few beaten down stocks in the market right now which have the potential equivalent to GE.

I completely ignored them until I opened my account for investing in March, 2017 - they didn't amount to much, only about $10k.Anyway, after I transferred them (still get a statement from Wells Fargo Shareholder Services/Equiti for a partial share) I watched it for a little while and then really looked at it to ask this question: If I was looking to buy a stock - is this one I would buy? The answer was no so I sold in April at $29.09.Anyway, for any inherited investment I think people should ask that question and, if it's large enough, ""What are the tax implications?"" The same holds true for other inheritance. For example, if you inherit property you don't live on, do you want to become a non-resident property owner and if so, is this a property you want?I probably should have asked myself that question in 1991, a little surprised I didn't - I don't know what it was worth exactly but I'm sure I could have used the money elsewhere. Oh well.In essence, don't let an inheritance bind you to some sort of asset you don't really want, are unwilling to manage, or have some purpose for. The whole, ""is it a good asset?"" should be the question you ask after you look at the asset type/class question.The how you sell it, or leverage it into some other sort of investment, or whatever becomes the third question.",

"Mycroft Friedrich:  You seem to be correct that GE has serious problems, which some may have noted a decade ago.   That is a problem.  Your friend has a problem too.  Your friend with the BROKER who ""refuses"" to sell shares (absent your firend's persistent effort)  needs to change brokers. I have yanked multi-million dollar accounts from firms for less.  If your pal inherited a $25 basis in GE, and still believes management will salvage the firm he might attempt a ""tax loss"" sale.  He is a bit late to get a ""round trip"" avoiding ""wash sale rules"" in 2018.  Will GE rally in early 2019 ?   Will any rally in 2018 or early 2019 be anymore than a technical bounce related to covering of ""tax loss sales.""   That is anyone's guess.  GE has a lot of debt, a lot of unfunded pension liabilities and many other attractions.  These have been apparent for years. It was sad to see a once great company like GE go down hill during the 1990s and early in this century.  It was sadder still to see the dubious acquisitions made and then peeled off.  However, I suppose hope springs eternal.  I agree with you, the problems at GE are 30 years old.  One could write to Jack Welch and ask if he has any ideas who did this to GE.  Right ?

"To Markmendlovitz,I also thought that a large backlog of orders was a sign of success. However, I have come to realize that, in the case of GE, it shows the dysfunction in the company.  They are unable to execute and fill the orders. that is why a backlog of 300 billion today will be a backlog 500 billion next year.",
"With our buy and hold strategies, drip investing, corded phones and bolo ties well in hand...GE should be cherished, held and added to at every opportunity. Stocks go up forever as well as dividends, its the dividend investor mantra and should never be deviated from. The titanic is still afloat my good man, Im am sure of it!",

Aviation is worth well over $100 billion. Their Healthcare division could probably fetch $60-70 billion, and the rest of the company, perhaps $50 billion. The debt situation is wildly overblown because you don't count debt in 2018 dollars unless you are also willing to forward all future cash flows from the years over which you pay off that debt to 2018! The analogy is a home mortgage. It might be a million dollars, and while you might have only a few bucks in the bank, if you can SERVICE THE DEBT, you aren't in trouble! GE has not only serviced its debt, but debt is going DOWN, and it's going to be much lower in the next quarterly report.",

The truth is that the reason customers chose inexpensive campers is because that is what Camping World sells. The reason sales are down is not so much the fear of a recession it is that Camping World cut all Sales Managers and Salesman pay so much that there has been a mass exodus of their top talent to leave the company for better jobs. The service part of Camping World is horrendous. They overcharge for everything and do average work at best. Check out there reviews.

I am certain that many companies have possible partnerships that will be announced pending the passing of the farm bill once hemp and CBD becomes legal in the US how profound do you think this will be? My thought process being, everyone expects this bill to become law, companies have most likely drawn up agreements that will be finalized pending the bill passing allowing the legal sale of CBD infusions. Many companies (I hate to use coke as my example) have stated they are watching closely and are intending to enter the sector once CBD becomes legal.

"The US Farm Bill is only the beginning because once the US 'Federal Government' (our #Senators and Representatives in #Congress) realize the huge tax revenue they have lost over the last 40 years by not legalizing the selling and buying of medical and recreational marijuana (MJ) and of course taxing it.  30 of the 52 US states have legalized at least one part of MJ and are taxing it on sales to recreational and/or medical MJ buyers and the Federal Government has not received 1 penny of tax revenues from states like California, Massachusetts, Washington, DC, etc..  Also, Massachusetts taxes all recreational buyers (Non-Medical Card buyers) of MJ 20% more by requiring the vendors to sell their MJ products to the recreational buyer for 20% more for buyers who do not have a medical MJ card.  Congress and #Trump (self-proclaimed trade war King) needs to get on the train to legalize MJ on a Federal level to tax it which will hopefully go towards lowering the US deficit vs. the US deficit GROWING every year...",
"In addition to the tax loss selling, there are two events that should move the cannabis market, the U.S. Farm Bill, if passed, and the highly possible legalization of CBD in Mexico.1) For the tax loss and January Effect, I look at the current price relative to the 52-week high. The greater the difference, the greater the bounce -- all else being equal.2) U.S. Farm Bill means a rescheduling of hemp from a Schedule 1 illegal drug to a commodity under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and, therefore, U.S. companies specializing in CBD oil.3) Mexican government's legalization of CBD, therefore, companies with connection to Mexico.Additionally, the greater the number of shares that I buy, the greater the amount of profit.That is, I want the most number of shares for the least amount of money.Most of the high market capitalization companies are too expensive for my purposes.I favor the highly speculative HempAmericana (HMPQ) at $0.01 and Puration Inc.

@Achilles Research exited AMD position much earlier and lost the upside. I dont have much faith in his analysis since then. If we can get PE of 30 in 2019 then with EPS of 60c to 65c the stock price can end 2019 at mid point of around $20.

Classic hype stock.• Remember FOMO. static.seekingalpha.com/...• Cowen upgraded AMD to $30 based on $1.75 EPS and $10 billion revenue, which is aggressive and unlikely.

AMD would violate SEC Regulation FD by doing that, and there's no reason to give analysts secret information that you withhold from investors. www.investopedia.com/...• Some of the upgrades are clearly unserious. Hans Mosesmann (success rate of 57%, the same as flipping a coin www.tipranks.com/... upgraded AMD to $30 on August 23, and then upgraded it again to $40 on September 11 (three weeks later) with nothing new in his report. www.cnbc.com/... and www.marketwatch.com/...V. AMD is run poorly, because the repeatedly fail to capitalize on opportunity• Demand for chips is skyrocketing in 2018. Intel capitalized on this and grew revenue from $62.8 billion in 2017 to $70 billion in 2018 (the $70 billion number is a current estimate and could easily go higher). www.intc.com/...• Notice Intel grew revenue by at least $7 billion as a result of the 2018 chip boom. AMD's entire 2018 revenue will not be $7 billion.• The 2018 chip boom was a wonderful opportunity for AMD to really grow. They claimed to have outstanding chips available, and should have capitalized by growing revenue by billions. But they did not. The benefit of the 2018 chip boom all went to Intel.• While Lisa Su and AMD are giving interviews to Jim Cramer, Intel is out there capitalizing on every morsel of opportunity, as a well run company should.VI.

On security. You may have read reports of University Scientists occasionally find extremely complicated and difficult-to-implement security weaknesses in Intel chips (spectre and so on). This is a huge benefit for customers who buy Intel. These scientists search Intel for security weaknesses because -- if they find one -- they can publish a paper, get their name in the news, get something on their resume and so on. They're effectively acting as Intel's free security workforce, finding things for Intel to patch. Other chip manufacturers don't have this, because you can only get in the news if you find a weakness in an Intel chip, because it dominates the market.X. On political and trade risk. AMD has huge political and market share risk due to a JV that allows Chinese companies to sell Epyc clones. The history is below.• In August 2015, the U.S. barred Intel (and implicitly AMD) from selling high-end server chips to a few (but not all) Chinese customers due to national security concerns. Intel complied. www.pcworld.com/...• A few months later, China went to Lisa Su to get basically the same chip from AMD via a complicated joint venture that complied with the letter of the law -- because the chip would not be sold by a U.S. company but would rather be sold by the Chinese JV (so no need to ask the U.S. for permission to export it to Chinese customers). www.forbes.com/...• A month ago, China started producing these Epyc server chip clones. As this article explains, they have a different name but are EXACTLY Epyc chips. www.tomshardware.com/...• The U.S. government is due to publish a report on Chinese theft of U.S. semiconductor IP that could name and shame AMD. ""ASSESSMENT OF THE U.S. INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY"" www.reddit.com/...• Based on the timing, it's clear the ONLY reason this JV was set up was to circumvent the government's ban.• These chips will be in the hands of those very customers the U.S. government said couldn't have them. In October 2018, China announced the first supercomputer using these clone chips. www.top500.org/...• These chips will take market share from Epyc, with AMD getting a tiny royalty instead of the large margins it would have made on Epyc.",

"Seriously no one finds it weird there are no age demographics on these earnings calls?  They address millennials are camping more but no sales figures in relation to age for their RVs?!I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!  Anytime they mention millennials demographic on the call there are 0 numbers presented.  Just opinions!  When they cite 37% of RVers are millennials they casually forget to mention this very telling statistic from the KOA 2018 North American Camping Report they are using:""Millennials are significantly more likely to include their parents in their trips and trip planning, with more than one-fourth of millennial campers saying they camp with their parents.This “parental inclusion” is most prominent among single millennials, with 42 percent of that group camping with their parents. Millennial couples without children are the least likely to include parents in their trips (just 18 percent). That number rebounds to 27 percent for millennial couples with children.""Gen X are the parents of the millennials!  You're see all these numbers inflated for millennials because Gen X is footing the bill!  Millennials are tent camping and hiking, free (basically) activities!",
"3, 5, and 10-year dividend growth rates are 12-16-18% respectively. Clearing 10%+ divy growth above the rate of inflation is pretty spectacular. Yield at current prices for THO is 2.7%, 5-year average is 1.6%. The SP500 yield is < 2% so THO dividend is pretty competitive, especially at these levels. Even if you bought last year sometime at $100 when the yield was more like 1.30%, you could have seen capital appreciation of 60%, at least on paper and depending if you sold or not. I think THO shareholders have had plenty of opportunities to realize excellent returns via capital gains, dividends, and special dividends over the last few years and the same should hold true in the future.",
"THO has been so profitable for so many years but the dividend yield is still quite low, and they instead decide to spend their profits on acquisition after acquisition, which may or may not prove accretive, resulting in much higher 'retained earnings' than book value esp. tangible book, on their balance sheet. Given cyclic nature of business, will shareholders ever get their investment back in dividends/buybacks before this business finally goes under in a recession or gets 'disrupted' by new tech?",
"The Hymer acquisition includes stock because the family believes in the business and want to participate in the long-term upside; they will not be dumping the stock at fire sale prices.I appreciate your conservatism towards the deal in terms of it adding debt and potential cultural challenges, but believe it will be a long-term home run for THO, provided that Europe remains politically stable, which is a major risk factor that you omit.Otherwise an outstanding article and analysis!  I wish I had the same cost basis!",
"In January of this year an analyst with a buy rating on THO and a price target of $217 wrote that the slowdown seen last December in unit sales was related to weather. I bet he still has his job. “We do not believe slower growth in December is due to a fundamental change in demand, but possibly related to weather or some other temporary impact. We caution any conclusions to be made from one month of data.”Wells Fargo analysts was just as constructive about future unit sales. So, analysts have been terribly wrong about this stock. If the demand was overestimated in 2017 and new estimate for 2019 are coming down, then THO should be worth today what it was going for in 2015: $48-$55. But if you take a recession into account, then $30 would be closer to reasonable prices. I own WGO towable and I realized how enthusiastic the buyers are about this lifestyle. The only thingt that would impede their demand is access to credit. So I am fully on board with the author about the strength of demand and growth for this industry. Nevertheless  the downside seems to be far bigger than the upside because a recession will significantly reduce demand for this nonessential purchase. I plan to dip my toe with CWH first since this company makes good margin on servicing RVs and selling insurance etc in addition to RV dealerships and retail for active customers. I also think the value is better in this stock than THO. If THO dips below $40, I will take a dip.",

"Facebook earns income by selling ads. We're headed into a recession: money supply growth has slowed and slowed for for years, from peak growth rates of %16 and %15 in 2010 and 2015, down to 3.5% and falling today. This fact heralds a recession soon and explains why the stock market bull, which was funded by money printing, is dead.There are a couple of easy conclusions to draw from this likelihood of looming trouble. First, Facebook's ad sales will drop; and second PE multiples will contract.In case you're not persuaded money supply deceleration has anything to do with the stock bubble popping, junk bond unease, and house-car sales falling, just remember that recessions always happen. Cheerleaders never see them coming, because they happen fast, not gradually.The Fed can stop lifting short term rates, but can't undo the effects already in the pipeline from the multi year slowing of money supply expansion.Give Facebook time to get hurt badly and wait for a resumption of QE, that may...or more likely will not... launch stocks into another bull market.",

"I would like to point out a few things. First, while ARM is certainly sufficient for the average consumer's needs (i.e. web browsing and occasionally streaming)there are some applications which benefit from ISA extensions like SSE3/4, AVX, etc. which would not be feasible to run on a RISC CPU because without these extensions you need significantly more hardware to achieve the same performance. This is true of many types of software such as CAD, video editing, image manipulation, media encoding/decoding, etc. True, some of these things can be offloaded to a GPU (a market which, by the way, AMD is significantly invested in), but GPUs do not do these things as accurately, nor does the software always support this.Second, though it is true that ARM can fit more cores into the same TDP and space as x86, it would be a mistake to conflate ARM cores with x86 cores in terms of performance. Sure, Apple's cutting edge custom ARM core on a new TSMC 7nm process can outperform an ultra low voltage Core i5 at half the clock speed in some benchmarks, but compare it vs. a modern Zen core at the same clock and it's a different story. I'm doubtful Amazon's new ARM chip with the same number of cores and half the total cache will actually be as performant as the 7601, and Rome is going to be another game entirely.Third, and this is the important part, none of this is going to happen overnight. Even consumer laptops and desktops, which practically have no validation or trust cycles and will see whatever parts HP or Dell think will provide them the most profit and the highest margins, are unlikely to move to ARM for at least a year or two, because it will take at least that long for all their software to make the jump. The quickest way for the movement toward ARM to die is for Microsoft to pull another Windows RT and put out something that is incompatible with practically everything. ARM in the datacenter will also take years before vendors even begin to seriously consider it, and it will take time from there to make it into the hands of businesses and sysadmins. And even then, for the reasons I mentioned above, there will still be a market for x86. In this time, it is certainly plausible for both Intel and AMD to design and build out competitive ARM chips, and AMD has already been working on this. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they're already planning to roll out ARM chips for one market or another some time in the next few years.All of this is to say, the author's advice to ""sell them now. Never buy them again."" is irresponsible at best.",

"@Trading Places Research The performance chart only lists the physical characteristics of the different chips from ARM, Intel, and AMD and shows no performance numbers.  Besides that you are mixing clock speeds with power figures that are in error.  The default clock speed is listed for the AMD server chips but you include the boost clock power levels in an obvious attempt to make the ARM chips seem more comparable.  The chip area is listed as the same for both AMD server chips which we know is not true since one has double the cores.  They may choose to physically put it in a similar package but the die sizes are not the same.Also, listing chip prices means nothing without listing the total cost of ownership of the server platform.  Yeah the ARM chips are priced lower but they also support only 40% of the PCIE connections that AMD supports.  AMD's model with the high end chip enables them to support the same I/O with a 1P configuration as Intel's 2P configuration.  This savings in dollars is way more than the difference in CPU prices.",
"One point, talent. In Silicon Valley, the hardest thing to find is new ideas, closely followed by top talent. Key to a company's survival.Intel et al have a problem. Top talent ends up in startups, big tech gets a lot of mediocre talent and self serving management. Compensation plans are how the companies are run, and gaming them is the goal of everyone. Long term? Two years at most. Long enough to get the Green Card or to hold that 'manager' title so you can hit LinkedIN and find a decent job and a company that doesn't resemble a Soviet Gulag. Ask anyone who has worked at Intel, AMD, Cypress, etc.A major downturn will drive talent back to the big tech companies, but that doesn't mean much.

"Your amusing article seems to draw upon every single fact you ever learned about computers as an armchair quarterback.  Unfortunately, you forgot IPC - instructions per clock.  To reach high speeds a modern computer is pipelined and requires anywhere from 8-20 clock cycles to finish each instruction.  Each of these clock cycles or ""steps"" in the processing of an instruction, includes memory buffers to save the intermediate result.  A chip reaches the 3 Ghz speed by starting an instruction on every clock, but the first instruction doesn't *finish* until 8-20 clock cycles later.  And if you do not design the CPU properly,  sometimes that 8-20 clock cycle pipeline empties out because the instruction you are about to start requires data from another instruction that is not yet finished.  While the pipeline is emptying out your CPU stalls and is 8x - 20x slower.The IPC for ARM designs (literally, the designs licensed from ARM holdings) is just not very good, because the CPU is designed for power efficiency, and portability to many VLSI processes.  ARM Holdings designs are not designed for maximum execution speed, and often the power efficiency is also not that great.  To double the power efficiency Qualcomm had to get into the chip-design business and they got the jump on Intel which is where the Snapdragon branding came from (Snapdragon = ARM designed by Qualcomm for power efficiency).   Intel responded about 12 months later with Haswell (4000-series Pentiums).  Then they promptly sat on their asses for almost 3 years!  They did not produce superior CPUs until the 7000-series Pentiums!Apple designs the A-series chips for execution speed AND power savings.  It seems clear that Apple is working on moving ALL its products (laptops, tablets, phones) to A-series CPUs.  The early A-series chips were designed by Jim Keller, arguably the #1 CPU designer on earth; he did A4, A5, and led AMD Ryzen, and now he's at Intel because the company is run by chimpanzees and they fired all their CPU designers 5 years ago (insider information) and so they are falling behind!There are only a few benchmarks that can show the difference between ARM and Pentium; Google Octane 2.0 is one of these benchmarks because the browser benchmarks runs on both phones and on laptop PCs.  I have the latest OnePlus 6T with the fastest Snapdragon 845 processor and 8GB of RAM.  I just ran it against my Chromebook (Acer c720 i3-4005U with 4GB of RAM) and I got:chromium.github.io/...Snapdragon 845 = 16311Celeron i3-4005 = 15909Therefore, the latest and greatest Qualcomm CPU core is equivalent to an i3 from 5 years ago! Today's datacenter CPUs would score in the low 30,000's.  In a datacenter the CPUs cost nothing, but power is expensive (because it requires air conditioning), and software is expensive (so if you have a 1-CPU license it pays to get the fastest CPU on earth and also it pays to buy a faster CPU to reduce your website latency).  So you believe that ARM == Pentium; in reality, ARM == Pentium / 2.And that is a show stopper for data center CPU sales.  Now if Apple decided to sell the A12 into datacenters, it would be game over, AMD and Intel.",

History is repeating, Calxeda are great at one thing - selling their wares to dummies, and draining them of all their excess cash!  Kudos to Calxeda!",
"This chump has no idea what he's talking about. Like area of Intel CPUs are 4000+ sq mm. Reticles that large haven't been built yet. intel's largest monolithic chip is of the order 700mm2 (HCC series) which is pretty massive. AMD uses 4 chiplets, each around 200 mm^2. Then he claims in that table that there is no doubt they can match the performance. Really? based on what, base frequency? Forgot about all-core turbo, and single core turbo? Performance is roughly IPC * frequency. Doesn't matter what your frequency is if your IPC is crap, which is the case for all ARM server competitors. Intel and AMD CPUs can wipe the floor clean with anything the ARM stable has to offer with the sole exception of Apple esp in power constrained scenarios.There's a bunch of nonsense in there about ARM being low power (wrong, implementations are high or low power). This guy doesn't know what he's talking about.",
"TLDR: If you love apple products, then you also love intel as it is the very fabric of your technology driven Apple device through product licensing for example, Thunderbolt...Apple is using licensed products such as thunderbolt 3, which is now royalty-free. However you can expect manufacturer's and patent holders such as Intel to put a license squeeze on these crucial connective technologies if their partnership for providing flagship system processors becomes compromised or degraded (not that Apple's use of intel processors is a large portion of Intel's market anyway...). Thunderbolt 4 is just around the corner and most if not all of apples peripheral devices such as monitors, connected storage, phone, device charging, external GPU's use Thunderbolt.If Apple wants to stay cutting edge, they will continue to license technologies from sources like Intel, others and ofc AMD.Everyone in the Apple hype category doesn't realize that Apple mostly licenses technology, they have a great software side and hold a lot of patents on software and design or implementation of design/function, but actual micro device manufacturing is not their field. No one mentions a company called Foxconn, guess who makes the vast majority of your apple devices? Yep Foxconn. Guess who makes the vast majority of motherboards and components out there, yep Foxconn. HP, Dell, Apple, Asus, AsRock, Intel, SuperMicro, etc, etc. Guess if you might what Foxconn uses in their automated manufacturing process controlling their robotics... Also Intel is into everything commercial, agricultural and industrial. I would love to see a statistic that shows how much electricity is consumed by devices driven by intel technologies at their core, comparing computing power  and their efficiency versus others.. That I think would put the shock and awe back into the industry perception by everyone attempting to insert their opinion on the topic.Whereas Apple might choose another processing company, Intel will simply squeeze the money from another source. The larger picture shows that intel will have to become more competitive, but it will be a fat chance in hell that apple choosing another vender for processing that would put intel on the outside. Intel holds more technology patents than anyone writing in here could guess. If you think they are just in the processor market, you are highly inaccurate in your thought process.A lot of the patents and stake holds in patents that Intel has is the very fabric of your Apple device. I would encourage you to think much broader. Intel isn't going anywhere anytime soon, unless their R&D department stops cranking out technologies and patents. That being said Intel has a lot of changing to do, with so many misses in the consumer market in the last 3 years they have a lot of ground to make up and hearts to win over again. I'll get my popcorn and watch how things develop...",
great about not buying amd or Intel but we need actionable not non actionable advice.... what to buy Softbank?...,
"For all the skeptics and x86 apologists there is a Youtube video with John Hennessy from an Oct, 2018 Stanford EE381 Colloquium about the ""New Golden Age for Computer Architecture"".  www.youtube.com/...His cohort David Patterson was not present for the presentation so it was not as focused on RISC-V as it might have been.  RISC-V as an 'open source' ISA and it is potentially the next competitor to ARM.  RISC-V still has a long way to go to achieve the economy of scale needed to be competitive with ARM.P.S.  The video might be educational even for some who think they are computer literate.",
"Zero benchmarks.  And there is a reason. ARM needs many more clock cycles to accomplish the same task.  There is a very limited number of things that ARM is good at because of the RISC (reduced instruction set computer) design.  There is a reason X86 instruction sets have been expanding rather than contracting into a RISC design. RISC is limited because the instruction set is limited. But in some applications it is worth it.  It is like a motorcycle. Less fuel required, but less passengers, less wheels and less load compared with the X86 pickup truck...but there are times when a motorcycle is fine for going from A to B.It certainly will not be replacing X86 computers en masse.AMD has put a lot of time into a very advanced RISC chip (en.wikipedia.org/...).  If the market ever opens excitedly for ARM, they will produce it, or some variation of it.  But it will still be a niche product.There is also an upper speed limit on a silicon process.  When you get less done each clock of that, naturally your performance is going to be impacted relative to a chip that gets more done each clock (MHz).You could put 500 ARM cores on a chip, but then you have all the internal communication issues, diminishing returns, greatly increased software complexity and loss of efficiency.  There are only so many customers who will embrace that headache to potentially save a little electricity or not.If something like this was going to take off, I would have thought it would have been Intel's Atom chip.  Everyone was already buying from Intel.  If less instructions to save some efficiency was the path of the future, Atom should have been embraced...it wasn't.  It wasen't exactly a RISC chip, but it had all the same strengths and weaknesses.AMD long.AMD is the best poised for the future.  Fabless has turned out to be the right call, though they were virtually forced to do it. The Infinity fabric they developed for core to core communication is second to none.  Chiplets in combination with the Infinity fabric appears to be complementary and just brilliant.  And adding to that using different processes for different chiplets was another brilliant stroke reducing costs at no performance hit. Intel has done nothing innovative in 5 years...except maybe 3D X-Point and I think they sold that to Micron. www.extremetech.com/...  Performance was way below expectations but still interesting for a few large data applications.  Innovation happens under pressure.  AMD has been under massive pressure, siting on the precipice of bankruptcy.  But they fought, they innovated, they cut costs in every conceivable way that did not compromise their most promising technology.  And they have begun to reap the rewards.Intel felt no pressure, became fat and lazy, and now they are in trouble.   Zen 2 in all of its incarnations looks to easily best Intel's CPU products in virtually every way.",
"The fact that Apple is on the cutting edge of chip technology not only speaks volumes about the wide ranging technological prowess of the company, but also is a serious warning sign for Intel.It looks like the writing is on the wall ...that within a few years hardly any Mac line of computers (if any) will be running on Intel chips, and this is a huge negative for Intel. While I realize only a small % of their sales are to Apple - Apple's shift away from Intel also hurts Intel's image and more importantly, others will attempt to replicate Apple's model here and also may eventually start moving away from Intel.Intel charges a hefty premium for their chips, and doing away with such a huge cost is something very important to Apple, and not just to Apple.",

Hardware vulnerabilities seem like the wild wild west for now.For the record, I am neither long, nor short, any chip companies, except long CY and I don't think they apply to these chip makers.

"Like @Bobco23, I know next to nothing about chips and the associated lingo. But, I do try to stay alert and informed about what is happening to the “forest” even if I don’t know the details about the various “trees”.  Over the last 30 years, the “forest” has constantly evolved to bring me, as a consumer, more capabilities and flexibility more conveniently. Plus, it seems to me that 5G will really accelerate this evolution in ways we cannot imagine now but will certainly mean new capabilities, more mobility, more flexibility.  Therefore, I’m reading all I can about 5G.  And when Amazon made its ARM announcement, I took notice simply because, with their variety of businesses, they must be preparing for 5G in a big way and ARM must be part of that process.  As a layman, I thank the author for a very useful article that also happened to trigger a multitude of informational comments.",
"Also:www.anandtech.com/...Q25: Several years ago, there was the expectation that AMD would be producing a number of ARM based processors, and then we got the singular A1100 product. Then it fell by the wayside: are there any plans along those lines anymore? Or is it evaluated?LS: We continue to do ARM-based development in a couple of areas. We have custom products around ARM, and we actually use ARM in our PSP as you know. We always look at ARM, and if it makes sense down the road to introduce another ARM standard product, we’ll consider that.But the focus for us has really been around x86 and our GPU roadmap. Part of what we have done is really focus the R&D efforts. I still believe that there are lots of good places for ARM in the industry so we’ll continue to take a look at that.",

"Respectfully, ARM has been trying to get into the data center for years and never got much foothold. Your assumptions are naive and based on simplified wishful thinking.",
"The idea that intel and amd ""don't see what's coming"" is ludicrous. Do you really think they don't pay attention? Also you dedicated too much space to the mobile socs, that fight took place a long time ago and arm has already dominated, from this point on they can either maintain dominance or lose it, intel or amd have nothing to ""lose"" in that market segment. Another ludicrous idea is that ""given enough money they can increase performance"" this isn't a money issue, it is an architecture issue, arm is designed to excel at low power and it does exactly that. Remaining low power while having comparable performance to the amd's and intel's most powerful cpus isn't a simpler problem to solve than having high performance while using low power (the other way around) nor is the x86 deprived of money and resources. That is not to say that arm may never find it's niche space in the datacenter, it probably will just like x86 found it's place in the chromebooks and some tablet-like devices. Also you are ignoring another two important things, x86 is in fact a collection of smaller architectures around the main one that can act in a very power efficient way for some tasks (extensions), in fact arm is also using extensions. Also, the ecosystem is a very powerful obstacle to overcome and this works both ways, x86->mobile and arm->datacenter. All these things make the recommendation of giving up on x86 because arm will dominate in the foreseeable future in the segments where x86 dominates rather absurd. Not only that, it doesn't even provide alternatives as the arm market is highly segmented.",
"AMD did invest considerably in K12 but then gave it up to concentrate on Zen architecture. AMD can pick up from where they left once they again have better financials to concentrate on developing new products, which is also important to increase revenues. 5G is around the corner which will require lot of IOT devices, edge computing, embedded devices using ARM. If AMD wants to play in this area then there is no choice  but to again work on ARM. My guess is that AMD will wait for a customer to come along to fund the development work for a semi custom ARM chip.",

The biggest problem I have with @Trading Places Research  is that he believes that users will use laptops with ARM and desktops with x86. In todays world every one wants to use common set of software across devices. So getting ARM into devices like Laptops and x86 in Desktops is not going to happen by 2020. For servers ARM is not a general purpose compute solution as they are slower than x86. Some special purpose instances may use ARM in servers like AMAZON.AMD has the chiplet technology and AMD did work on new ARM design with Jim Keller spending quite some time working on it. Going forward AMD will not be just a CPU or a GPU company. It will be a chiplet company using different IP's and making custom chips for various customers using its semi custom group. AMD will still supply general purpose computing chips for those customers who dont want to spend more for custom chips.So in next 2 years AMD will be evolving into more of semi custom company then off the shelf supplier of the chip. 5G communication technology will demand disparate devices and many customers will line up on AMD doors to get it made for them. AMD is known to pivot with new designs. AMD is well aware of the changing environment and they will make their move at the right time. The product planning team at AMD is not asleep. They are thinking 2-3 years ahead. Why couldn't Nvidia come out with 7nm chips earlier? Because Nvidia did not plan for it 2-3 years ahead as AMD did. This is why Lisa Su and Mark PapperMaster have been so successful. Hopefully future Management leaders at AMD will follow their Lead,

"Many analysts get caught up in numbers and miss dollars.For example, Apple is great because with around 20% of the worldwide smartphone sales they capture around 85% of the profits. They are not the top smartphone seller, Samsung is, and last I saw were either on the verge of losing or already lost 2nd place to a Chinese upstart.Many people think Intel is the top chip manufacturer in the world but they are 5th or 6th in terms of wafers produced and at least briefly just lost first in terms of dollars to Samsung. Arguably, they may have lost first long ago in terms of real value because there are a lot of arguments about how to figure out the exchange rates, but they are still massive.It is unarguable that Intel is nowhere near the top in terms of numbers of chips sold - especially in terms of numbers of CPUs. ARM ships many times more processors than all x86 vendors combined.But to assail the high-end dollar market in the x86 biz is like predicting that Android with its ~80% market share is about to make a dent in Apple's 85% profit share. You can argue all day long very reasonably that they should. Why would people keep paying nearly $1000 for $400 phones? It just doesn't matter. They will. The lower guy has the market volume share because they are the lower guy. How will they go after those high profit markets? By offering devices on lower margins because that's what they've always done.They will never be able to sell devices with high profit margins. The mindset of not paying a high margin for an ARM will persist. It has many years of history.If they offer devices that appear to compete in tech such as running 25 hours on battery, the x86 players will offer crippled chips that have similar power efficiencies and match the performance. If the x86 players have to come up with some tech magic to do so, they will. They have a bigger defensive R&D budget and will prevail.Worst case, they'll dump product to cut the feet out of the upstart industry assuming it starts to get enough traction to warrant attention (which is a point that it is approaching thanks to MS using it to apply pressure).",
thx TPR...what do you think of Softbank as an investment ?,
"Great article.  Apple's announcement that they are consolidating their products on one OS and one chip architecture (ARM) is just the start.  Amazon recently announced a low power consumption server based on ARM.  The 64-bit ARM architecture is a game changer.Intel has tried to do low power, such as with their Atom architecture, but they want to preserve compatibility with their x86 instruction set.  They have the engineers - they need to design a new architecture from scratch and perhaps initially offer a firmware-based interpreter to allow x86 comparability.",
"I went through the article, perhaps I missed it, but did you consider that the internals of the chips are so fundamentally different that existing PC and laptop software will not run on ARM processors?More than likely, PCs and laptops with ARM would need all new software.

"Technically a very fair article.  Will it actually happen?  Maybe.  Sometime.  Also Intel could (re)enter the ARM market, they have dabbled, and must have some kind of current license if only through Altera.  Much of the power of any processor chip is not the cores but the cache and memory architecture, which can be done as well for ARM as for x86.  There are some counter-arguments available, though - future processors may be combinations of RISC and CISC, so somewhere in-between, a lot of the AI/ML processing is better done with CISC-style architectures.Also, today's chips of any variety are already hideously powerful, for the mobile/desktop markets.  So if it turns out an ARM chip is a little less efficient, rather than more - it doesn't even matter.  Yeah sure game benchmarks and video editing, whatever.And for cloud, maybe there are a lot of small site servers that just sit idle 90% of the time, so rather than put twenty of them on one server they could each have a more modest, if it turns out that way, ARM server, and everybody wins.All good arguments for why ARM *could* have a lot more market share, though none of it explains why this didn't already happen five or ten years ago.",
"As a rule you need 2x in performance and power to displace a desktop or server CPU even if you are able to run the same software. That is what has happened historically.

Amazon and Microsoft will experiment with all kinds of things to see if there is an advantage, but it has to make sense.",

"There are a lot of defenders of Intel in your comments.  I will add my two cents.  The articles  projections of damage going forward in time are a little misleading the damage has already been done.  The iPad killed the 'netbook' and the number of Intel processors has been shrinking ever since.  Between Android and iOS smartphones and tablets the number of Intel processors per year has dropped by about 100 million.  The number of applications that are ARM specific is getting larger on an annual basis.  As the performance of ARM processors continues to close the gap with x86 the workloads that can be performed on both platforms continues to grow.Intel and AMD were both aware of the dangers of ARM and took defensive action.  Intel purchased Infineon, wrote Android for x86 and provided a lot of contra-revenue to move smartphone vendors over to x86.  Their ability to integrate and disrupt their own markets held them back from making real inroads into the smart device market.  As you have mentioned, AMD, also designed a pin compatible ARM processor.  The desktop market is dying and I doubt that an ARM vendor makes anything specific for this market.  The Intel practice of shutting off ECC on a die and selling it as a consumer product probably won't be reproduced by anybody else.  AMD isn't even following the practice in this space.  The business workstation workloads are moving into the cloud and will be accessed by a laptop or mobile device.  Gamers are getting pushed up into a very expensive niche market that may slowly die.ARM brings a design flexibility towards workloads and this is becoming increasingly important.  Intel has recognized this with the purchase of both Altera and a number of AI specialists.  This will be an interesting battle field as die volumes matter and where Intel has thrived is by providing a general purpose processor to numerous customers to increase volume.  Many of their customers are now large enough that they may be able to custom design a solution for less than the margin that Intel is asking.  The Google TPU is a case in point.  The AWS Graviton may have much higher volumes than many believe as it is built primarily for networking and may be in many servers besides the instances offered.  Here is a point made at the AWS re:Invent 2017 on how Amazon is using their ARM technology from Annapurna labs; ""However, it was the C5 instance, released just this month, that was first to offload the entire EC2 stack -- from networking and storage to management, security and monitoring -- onto dedicated hardware. Developed using technology AWS acquired in 2015 when it purchased Annapurna Labs, the C5 marked the debut of the ""new EC2 hypervisor,"" DeSantis said.""ARM is moving into the server space already, maybe not as the primary compute node, but as a network manager and potentially a co-processor manager.awsinsider.net/...",
Baiting their competition is what Intel does best. They wait until their competitors invest heavily in a solution until they introduce the next big architecture change. How many times had AMD caught up only to be left in the dust shortly there after. Lets see what Intel has in store for their next server architecture when they respond to this so called Armed attack.,

"@Trading Places Research ""obvious that ARM-based chips can compete with Intel and AMD in this space on performance""Maybe, maybe not.  But, you gave *zero* evidence of it.  Hardware specs about clock speed, cache, etc. are *not* proof of performance.  Benchmarks, that actually measure performance, are the only way. Also, you mentioned it, but to be clear.  Only a very small fraction of current Windows 10 programs will run on ARM.  Intel and AMD x86 instructions, will not run on an ARM CPU. Yes, many of the most popular programs, have been ported to ARM, but that still leaves *most* of the Windows programs (apps) cannot be run on a computer with an ARM CPU. There have been many attempts to use ARM CPUs, in servers, and Windows computers.  They have all failed (because of incompatibility, and performance).  It is not at all obvious, it will succeed now.

"Please allow me to explain how Intel analyzes these issues, which is far more sophisticated than naive people think.Below is a tweet from Intel engineer Raja Koduri. In it, he compares two generations of chips. Brand A vs Brand B in 2017, and again in 2018. For example, in 2017, Brand B's chip did 41% better (1.41) 10809 h.264 mobile video playback, and in 2018 it did 36% better (1.36). twitter.com/...So you see, Intel is keeping keen track of the competition and testing its chips against the competition's chips every year, in every benchmark (you see, there are actually dozens of workloads, each of which must be tested). It then does a balancing of cost and other factors to put out the chip it thinks will be most competitive.In summary -- it's on it. I don't think QCOM has any chance in this space. It can't produce the super-powerful chips needed for high-end gaming, and few will want its off-brand chips in laptops when they can get a solid brand (that will perform better in all the workloads, not just one cherry-picked one).QCOM is foolishly wasting money on this effort, and on its lawsuit against AAPL.",
"Pretty good article... Anyone in tech is paying attention to ARM... It's an interesting convergence going on as smaller geometries enable more cores and higher clocks for ARM and similar growth but less power for x86...

Yes, MS made HISTORIC mistakes, but not by being late to phones but bothering at all since the x86 arch has a lot of baggage to move to phones...Had they branched mobile and desktop they could have competitive OS' in both but they decided to support phones with LCDs and workstations with the same UI... I'm typing this on one of three LCDs and Win10 UI sucks real bad for it... But MS is driving Azure rather than Windows so Win7 is holding onto lots of market share, especially with the problems with Win10 updates...It's hard to say what Intel is planning since 10nm has been delayed so long, but x86 mobile has the advantage of a huge software ecosystem... MS has even launched Windows on ARM to not much fanfare or market penetration earlier this year...This could change with 5G next year, but just like tablets were more favored, phones will somewhat blunt the ARM laptop market... It should really start to shake our around Q319... At best ARM needs a killer app and expanded OS' for desktop... Chrome OS is barely at Win8 numbers so the lion's share of gaming laptops will remain x86 along with pro applications..

Because those ARM devices must emulate x86 to run my applications - an emulation price of 50% in time - so I will wait twice as long or more for the same workload to complete.  Please take time to view this ENTIRE video.  Kudos for your terrific efforts though - too bad its all about ARM !www.youtube.com/...",

"ARM's x86 emulation has never been close to performing well enough to compete with Intel and AMD processors. ARM-based Windows 10 laptops released by HP and Asus have garnered poor reviews and benchmark scores well below Intel's current low-end processors like the Celeron. It might have a place for inexpensive Chromebooks and other small notebooks designed mainly for web-browsing and e-mail. But it would not be able to compete with enterprise workstations, and certainly not in the data center realm. It can't crunch in those arenas.",

These responses are PUNishing.,
"ARM CPU still have a big issue running x64 application under windows OS. Many application  won't even run directly, have to run under emulation which degrades performance. ARM is long known for power efficiency which are so popular for phones and tablets, but as a different desktop CPU, it's still lagging way behind Intel and AMD in term of performance, mostly likely be used on low end laptop and ultra compact units emphasize on low power consumption. I doubt ARM will be used in any performance demanding  work stations.",
"I think you may want to do a little bit more research on how to measure CPU performance and value.  None of the metrics you listed are measures of performance.  They are indicators of possible performance, but there is a difference between the two.  How many instructions per cycle are being done?  What sort of throughput is happening?   Are the workloads heavy on the calculations or more on data movement? Can ARM have a place in the data center?  Sure it can.  But it may be more specialized to specific types of work.",

Very good article. I'll be watching this business very closely.,
Nice long SWKS article and no mention of the pristine balance sheet? SWKS is ready to go to war with this balance sheet quality. I'm long SWKS and probably adding more shares today.,
"""Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is in quite an ambiguous spot at the moment from a financial perspective as the coming 5G and IoT waves seem poised to boost the company's fortunes while a slowdown in premier smartphone demand in China and for Apple's (AAPL) iPhones pulls in the other direction. ""Most people focus on the upcoming transition to 5G as the most important catalyst for Skyworks.  Yet a large portion of smartphones in the world are still on either 2G or 3G.  Those will likely migrate upwards, and those migrations may represent even larger increases in TAM than 5G...though I don't have concrete data to share currently.  Beyond that, there are still hundreds of millions of humans without smartphones; most of those will likely acquire them in the not-too-distant future, and Skyworks will profit from that as well.",
"""The company's reliance on the fickle smartphone market and on a few large customers remain risks""In what way do you see the smartphone market as ""fickle""?  Units sold annually, while plateauing over the past couple years, are quite steady.  And from the data I've seen, the proportion that is high-end has also remained fairly stable.As to reliance on ""a few large customers"", I think this is a bit overblown.  It is highly unlikely that Apple would dump Skyworks; it is in Apple's interest to keep the industry divided among a few players as it is today.   As far as risk of Apple itself potentially losing major market share, this is not a risk to Skyworks as long as 1) people keep buying smartphones like they are today, and 2) Skyworks gets their share of that TAM.  Given that smartphones are becoming MORE important in everyone's lives, not less, seems likely that the smartphone market TAM applicable to Skyworks will remain robust, and highly likely that Skyworks will continue to hold roughly the share it has today,",
I’m long SWKS.  Very good article think it is pretty much on point.,
"I don’t trade this stock, I own it thru thick and thin.  It has done very well.  A low basis can give courage.",
You make good points about the risks facing SWKS but at some point you'd have to say those concerns are in the stock already.This stock has gone from $115 to less than $70 in six months. The balance sheet looks clean and the management seems realistic and prudent. At some point you'd have to say the sell off is overdone. I think (hope?) that time is now.,
I’m adding every week till the end of 2019,
Thanks for a mostly balanced article.  I appreciate your inclusion of the discussion of new BAW filter capabilities as I had somewhat forgotten that.One associated negative is that SWKS’s dependence of AAPL could be impacted by AAPL indicating they may not address 5G until 2020.....which could lead customers to wait until those phones come out and thus 2019 could be weaker as the smart consumer waits for this significant upgrade.,
Thank You.  I was glad to hear Liam's comments (and analyst challenge) about BAW in the future.  You mention Interest Rate Hikes as Risk and I agree but is more of a Market Risk Phenom vs SWKS because SWKS has no LT Debt.  So ??I am wonderous of next quarters EPS because of the large amounts of Buybacks in the Last Year - MGMT is forecasting Sales as pretty close to Flat YtY but with less shares EPS could look up materially?  More important to me is Cash Flow.  I have SWKS on double secret probation - but have a load already.  I have open obligations to buy more but am watching this Business closely.   Looking forward to additional comments.  Have concerns about the real MOAT.,Skyworks: Should You Ride Out The Storm?

As an example, if T were to purchase $10 billion at the current price of $30.14/share 332 million shares could be purchase reducing the dividend payout by $664 million.

Shareholders will see. The nda will get filed... update on launch ... boom dilution to fund their inhalers. Carlos has no choice to dilute before the street figures out Symjepi won’t be bringing in FA for profits in 2019. The longer Carlos waits and the numbers come in the less chance of capitol raise to get “some kinda” product to market that’ll get revenue. Imho this stock is 1.50/share by 2019 end ...also on verge of bankruptcy.,
This company and their supporters make me laugh. You can only pump news for so long....at some point there will need to be some money made. “Hey we will launch soon” after 1 1/2 years of delays. A couple Nda to be filed by year end?... uh huh we are at the point of “ believe when seen”. Imho there won’t be any significant revenue coming in from there “pipeline” for 2 years ( I’m being optimistic at that).,
"Adamis blew every chance that could have enhanced the share holder value. From having $$Millions in accounts right after Symjepi approval to dilution in 2018. The company lied to shareholders at every given level, sometimes pointiny towards last earning, and other time by disclosing no information.

I am not sure what is the cheer and standing ovation is for, but the company has Once again faked on its promise. a) U.S Compound is nowhere near 30% increase in revenue. The only increase were the losses.b) Symjepi moved to Q1 2019.

"blue-mace, you mentioned you called Sandoz and got the response of ""the product will be launched by 2019 year end hopefully"". Just a couple days later, Sandoz announced the news of the launch Q1. What happened to the company? Did you call Sandoz?",
So this product will be launched early 2019. I would really like to know how they plan on educating people to use this. I suggest everybody to do their own little survey wherever you live. Walk out your front door and ask the first twenty people you see without bias; “hey my kid has allergies/opiate dependency so I have him carry rescue devices...if you found him lying their how would you administer it?”. What your going to hear is quite a few say “to the heart” ( cause more people watched Pulp Fiction instead of reading labels). Give it a try tell me if I’m wrong.,
Why do you think it took a year and half to bring this product to market? Why do you think it’s a 50/50 deal ( unheard of numbers for a collaboration... Sandoz takes all expenses off the top then split profits) its because of the lawsuit liabilities... that’s what the reason in.,
"The price of lawsuits is factored in when taking this Symjepi product to market.. doesn’t mean it’s safe. Sandoz is big Pharma and has to compete in the market to keep up with Teva Pfizer etc. Pfizer gave up on their own “delivery device” and went with an approved companies autoinjector... I’m pretty sure Sandoz is only partnering with Admp for the same reason as Pfizer ( cost/time for autoinjector approval). This is just a quick fix for Novartis they know Symjepi isn’t the answer ... they can afford some lawsuits they can’t afford to not have a product in theses spaces. So, future collaborations are doubtful without big expense.",
"Stop quoting surveys comparing Milan’s device ( first to come out). The needle method of delivery is like buying a gun “ your more apt to shoot yourself”. How long do you think it’ll take before there is lawsuits against doctors and all involved with Symjepi after they have been exposed to HIV or Hepatitis? Another thing is the disposal of these products after use. The reality of today is drug overdosed people/drug users don’t go to the hospital( avoiding police/trouble). Often they are giving free rescue devices....do you really want needle like devices (possibly tainted)laying around parks,alleys or wherever out in public? All because Symjepi priced $50 lower. The autoinjector is safe to the administer and afterwards. This type of device is a loaded gun just waiting to go off. Please think twice, think of the “reality” of safety for our children. This is not worth making a dollar off. IMO Sandoz/Admp should spent the money and time to make a safer device instead of trying to make profits now.",
All you guys pumping the “pre filled syringe” Symjepi device are over looking one huge factor...the exposed needle. It’s a huge safety issue. You want to make like its simple .. take the cap off inject needle put cap back on. Here’s the reality. Someone’s unconscious from choking/overdosed you jab them and they awake flailing/confused and you get jabbed yourself by same needle ( be careful you say) but talk to any paramedic they will tell you how heroin/crackheads will often get violent you wrecked there high and  “attack”. Now that little scenario can get you HIV/ hep C etc. You really want to “share a needle” with who your saving? Watch YouTube it’s an eye opener. What makes you think the general public ...under stress/ panic can administer this needle safely? Why take the risk? You might want to sell a million of these things to make money but No responsible Doctor will write a prescription for this device.,
"Great article Biologics, and you raised an excellent point about the potential to expand the market.. Before the pricing scandal and recalls, this was a topic Mylan used to address frequently in presentations and conference calls. Recall most recent annual scripts are around 4M, and 15% of those go to the pro market. But FARE estimates as many as 15M Americans have food allergies, and some estimates for risk of anaphylactic shock are as high as 43 million patients. So I agree there is potential to expand the market.I also think there is enormous potential for the naloxone product. It may have already been filed, since the company doesn't always announce NDAs. And I think there is a reasonable likelihood it gets fast tracked, since the syringe has already been approved twice. Like Narcan, the compact, intuitive and reliable Symject is a platform technology with many potential uses.One more comment regarding the lengthy delay in bringing Symjepi to market. Concurrent with their efforts to license and launch Symjepi, Sandoz has also undertaken a massive restructuring of their US business. Following a 9-month auction process and just two months after the Symjepi license deal, Sandoz announced divestiture of its US Dermatology business and US oral solids portfolio for $900M plus $1B in potential earnouts. Their intent is to focus on faster growth and higher value-added products. Notably, they retained their complex generics business including injectables. Since Sandoz negotiated the Symjepi deal concurrently with a broader strategic realignment, it's reasonable to surmise the Symject platform has been thoroughly vetted not only logistically, but strategically as well. I think Sandoz sees numerous potential uses for Symject within its injectables portfolio, and I doubt future license deals will take as long.I think (and hope) you're right about ADMP being a good short term trade, but longer term I think it's a multi-bagger. Thanks again for a great article!",

"@Anton Wahlman , all the auto makers getting killed; TSLA maintaining its value. This market is stupid...People seem to think that TSLA's technology is superior. It's good, but others have good technology too and I suspect by the time EV becomes really prominent, they all will have good technology. So why does anyone pay up for TSLA? Its potential cost structure through cheaper batteries? It isn't because of their valuation. I'm not saying that TSLA is a bad company, doesn't produce reasonable cars, or has bad technology, I'm just saying that the market is really missing something. Companies that are late to the EV party, such as FCAU are now on target to produce 20 different EV models in short order. However, compare FCAU and TSLA's valuation; crazy... And you mention Jaguar, which is Tata motors ($TTM). This company is trading at less that 2x EV/EBIT, about half of where it normally trades (FCAU is trading at ~5x EV/EBIT).

What actually happened is that the hipe/press and awareness of the Model 3 increased demand for the Model S/X.  The same will happen with any new EV from any manufacturer, this will only bring more attention to ALL EVs and take away sales from ICE cars and sell more EVs including Model S/X/3/Y/etc..  The E-TRon, the i=Pace and all others will not take current customers away from Tesla, they will take current customers away from ICE manufacturers.  People aren't going to sell their Model X to buy an e-Tron or i-Pace, they are going to sell the gas car and buy one or once they start considering electric, may buy a Tesla.

Legacy Auto is trapped, and their only way out is through lower-margin, lower-maintenance outsourced electric vehicles.  No more oil changes.

"Agreed. But his analysis on the market dynamics of the EV market isn’t wrong. Some number of sales of the non-Tesla premium EVs will be to people who would have bought a Tesla if the non-Tesla premium EV existed. Obviously, no one knows what that number will be and it probably will never be directly measured. So it could be a loss of 1k car sales a month, a quarter, a year, or even a week. No one knows. However, if there is a meaningful sales impact on sales, Tesla will be in trouble. They need to sell every car they have the capacity to produce over the next 10 years to even have a chance at justifying its current price",

In case that series of APUs sounds familiar, these are the same chips AMD is rumored to introduce as its next-generation Ryzen 3000 mobile processors, which have been recently spotted in a few HP laptop benchmarks and even in an upcoming AMD-powered Surface Laptop.This new streaming Xbox won’t just be powered by a laptop CPU of course. Microsoft will undoubtedly want the chip stripped of unnecessary components and have a custom packaging made for its upcoming console. Interestingly, this new chip is said to offer even better performance to power, which may allow it to fit into an even smaller form factor than the Xbox One S and Xbox One X.Microsoft is purportedly tuning the APU to run ‘latency sensitive’ calculations, which we assume means the console will be able to render predicted frames in games. This way, before you even move, shoot or press a button on your controller, the game will be ready to animate your action and reduce the lag that streaming games suffer.AI comes to gamingThe second part of this technology is a piece of software called Project Brainwave, which is deep learning acceleration platform for real-time AI that Microsoft announced last year. This deep learning software will supposedly run on both the console and on Microsoft servers, improving its ability to predict the actions of players in an effort to minimize latency.This all might sound like some lofty goals from Microsoft, but the company has been making strides into game streaming. Microsoft’s recently announced Project xCloud already lets you play Forza and other Xbox One games on your phone, thanks to the company converting its datacenters to work with its consoles, so the company is already putting in the legwork into a game streaming future.Between multiple confirmations of AMD’s upcoming APUs and Microsoft’s evolving Cloud architecture, the Xbox Scarlet Cloud is almost assuredly real. Still, there’s a chance this might be all smoke and mirrors, so stay tuned to TechRadar for more news on this front.""",

This will allow Microsoft to make sure that the Streaming Xbox can be sold for much less than the traditional next-generation box.The last we heard of Microsoft’s streaming technology, the company was implementing AI to learn the actions of each individual user.

"@Austin Craig Geez, a non-confusing title - how straightforward.   :) Very nice article. AMD's weakness for quite a long time has been single thread performance.    The IPC between AMD  2700X  and Intel 9900 family are basically the same,  and the single thread advantage Intel has is because of higher clock speeds. With the IPC for Ryzen 2 reported to be somewhere between 10-15% and the 7nm process supposed to give a 20% clock speed improvement,   I can't see how AMD does not have the single core performance crown - and therefore the gaming crown - which is a very big deal.   AMD's multi-core strength will become overwhelming with more cores Ryzen 2 brings.Having the undisputed title of ""Fastest CPU"" in 2019 will have a huge marketing benefit for AMD, even though AMD isn't that far behind right now.       Fastest Desktop, fastest HEDT, fastest server CPU,   fastest Laptop chip...     all this will add up to a stronger wave than people can believe right now.

AMD previously said Rome would launch first but Ryzen will be right behind (Q218 earnings)... I'm thinking Rome in Mar/Apr and Ryzen in Jun/Jul with Ryzen Mobile in August... All 2019 chips should support PCIe 4 which will double bandwidth for GPUs and NVMe...Only Ryzen and EPYC will increase core counts I think... TR just got updated chips and bandwidth is stretched for the 32C TR... If they can up the clocks by even 25% with 10% IPC, that will kill Intel HEDT... And now with the IOC, they can waste less dies by creating dual channel, quad channel and octo channel IOCs so a 16C Ryzen is possible with high clocked DDR4...  AnandTech asked about it but Papermaster was evasive... But looking at the pic AMD showed, it looks 4-way symmetrical...Of course they need to get more momentum behind EPYC but I keep seeing new platforms from every OEM and ODM... Even Atos (the most dense HPC) is adding Rome to their new platform.. And PCIe 4 will push AMD even farther ahead in IO with double the bandwidth for GPUs or double the GPUs... HW virt will be more GPUs and HPC will be more bandwidth...We can also assume that AMD will work to directly support Cray Slingshot which will probably end up the first exascale platform in 2021... AMD is set to be using TSMC 5nm then so a 16C chiplet will be half the size of Zen1 CCXs...AMD didn't bet on a magical transformation, but great products with a great roadmap for the next 4 years... Their supply chain is adjusting well to the trade war by moving more work to Taiwan and Japan... And the China initiatives are made there so them owning a majority share keeps IP within the rules...The biggest hype they could create with CES is a new GPU roadmap down to GPU chiplets and up to high end gaming... The funny thing is Turing uses an FMAC similar to what Bulldozer introduced so using that for Navi would do some damage... But hey I love to speculate...Still long...",
"""Per Chart #1, it's likely the majority of AMD investors are somewhere between hope and optimism.""Looks like it has been depression for a while.I think we have seen the bottom.

"CES hype for AMD has never been prolonged or significant.If you're expecting a big rise in shares it'll have to be because AMD announces that EPYC on 7nm is shipping. Otherwise the hype will die and the stock will loose its CES gains and continue to fluctuate in the $18-$21 range, as it's done every year. There needs to be a catalyst for this to change, especially in the fear oriented market we're in. AMD still hasn't proven that it can make significant gains against Intel in selling CPU's in any market other than in private custom desktops.I look forward to the Epyc announcement, but I don't expect any real gains until it happens.Analysts could always decide to hype the stock though, as they did in September.",

"I don't believe Tramps Tariff ""ceasefire"" he has over-inflated everything he says, nothing to do with AMD itself but comes Jan, we might see a general sell off, don't think the market has hit bottom yet ..thinking 22k is bottom ..for 2019, sitting on $200k cash right now or about 30% of investable assets ..either way up, down sideway, I'll that find ways to make the $$",
"Nice article Austin.I agree wholeheartedly that AMD is set to rocket back up due to the CES coverage and the hype-train that will inevitably come both before and after the event.If the recent video by AdoredTV is accurate, CES will be the catalyst for AMD to hit all time highs in Q1 2019. They will undoubtedly demonstrate their new Ryzen 3000 chips beating the pants off Intel's 9900K in all use cases and at a far lower price point. Intel will be beaten on both absolute performance and perf/watt until they can get their 10nm or 7nm fabs up and running.I also think it's starting to become clear that AMD has some architectural advantages over both Intel and nVidia that will be realized in the coming years with Zen 3 and Zen 4. There's just certain things that AMD can do because of their product stack and architecture that Intel and nVidia can't do.",
"CES is not hype, it is when we get the real CPU/GPU performance numbers and features. Bit of a spin there.Always trying to push AMD lower...but it is going to bounce.  It is the best of America.  One heck of a scrappy little fighter.  It has met every objective and excelled beyond expectation.  Zen 2 is going to be huge.  And Navi looks far more interesting than a week ago.AMD long.",

Long Amd,
This is psychologically very interesting article for stock game. Thanks. I hope many investors read this.,
There’s absolutely no reason to believe AMD won’t trend with tech going forward. That’s either up or down.,
@Author I don’t think 19.5 is a good strike price for selling the put. Intel will hold a architectural meeting on 12/11. SP has a higher chance to drop below 19.50. But I do agree with you about the CES hype.,
the  RX 590  is  perfect   u know  u are  not getting  a  possibly used  crypto 580 !,
To me its more important to understand where AMD stock price will be by end of 2019. My guess at the moment is that it will be between $18 and $25. Can anyone give reasons why it can be lower than this?,
"It's true that product hype will surround CES, but here are a few issues:• According to highly dubious leaks by pro-AMD commentators, a number of new chips and cards are coming out. The problem is none of them will beat the 9900k in gaming, or NVDA's cars. They will also have rock bottom prices. Thus AMD is apparently continuing its ""crap for cheap"" 99c store business method.• Intel is not only sticking with its Winter 2019 schedule for 10nm chips, but this week Murthy stated they will have the promised 2.7x density increase over 14nm. That's far more density than anything TSMC hopes to make next year. Factor in Intel's superior engineering and these will be monster chips. News surrounding this (including an architecture day on Dec. 11) will stifle some of the AMD hype.• Contrary to popular belief, AMD's stock price appreciation isn't so much based on technical news but by momentum buyers. ""Don't argue with the tape"" as they say, meaning that if a stock's price is going up, be quiet about everything else because you're wrong. That's why your'e in an extremely dangerous situation with AMD right now. Over the past month and a half or so, you've seen it try to inflate, then go down, try to inflate, then go down . . . eventually those buying or holding AMD for hope and hype are going to get scared off and sell.",
"I can't say if a stock price will go up or down base on news, but I know two things:1. I won't listen to punters... nothing is accurate.2. I won't listen to news or reports.. nothing is accurate.I would look at the price and volume to trade/buy/sell. I won't advice you to buy or sell AMD, all I know is you have to look at the chart and talk to someone who knows. Cheers.",
Your charts are stunningly accurate. Small edit though... It's Ryzen 3 that is coming in a while. Ryzen 2 debuted in 2018. I know it's easy to mix up with the Zen numbers. Maybe easier to say Ryzen 3000 series so it is more distinct in mind.,
"For the last 3 years, AMD is delivery mostly what they promised, other than the Vega GPU which is under delivered. AMD is going a great job on the CPU side, hope this time AMD do  truly deliver the Navigation GPU.",
"INTC claims it's working on a discrete GPU that will compete against NVDA and AMD. I think as long as one makes something comparable with the 2060 and prices it properly, you have competition.Fortunately the most popular video games (Fortnight, Any Blizzard title, LOL etc..) are all GPU friendly and run reasonably well on almost any card.",

Once the FDA approves V for treatment of MACE, $AMRN will have gone through its production and sales  growing pains and then can effective open the MACE market.Most of the doctors that I know here is Southern California are slightly familiar with $AMRN and view V as a drug solely for the treatment of abnormally triglycerides and are totally unaware of its value in treating MACE.I've printed up some of $AMRN's reports and passed them out to some of the physicians I know for perusal.

Under English law, a bidder seeking to acquire us by means of a takeover offer would need to make an offer for all of our outstanding ordinary shares/ADSs. If acceptances are not received for 90% or more of the ordinary shares/ADSs under the offer, under English law, the bidder cannot complete a “squeeze out” to obtain 100% control of us. Accordingly, acceptances of 90% of our outstanding ordinary shares/ADSs will likely be a condition in any takeover offer to acquire us, not 50% as is more common in tender offers for corporations organized under Delaware law. By contrast, a scheme of arrangement, the successful completion of which would result in a bidder obtaining 100% control of us, requires the approval of a majority of shareholders voting at the meeting and representing 75% of the ordinary shares voting for approval...""Takeda recently bought out Dublin based Shire and it required 75% of Shire shareholders' vote (and 2/3 of Takeda) since it was not a hostile takeover and was instead a Scheme of Arrangement.",Amarin: A Poison Pill For The Miracle Pill

So are you denying Beacon's estimates?  I've done my back of the envelope calcs to justify the $1B.  Where is your evidence?  Show me some facts...,

I’d put more weight on rev they actually generate than the rev per sq/ft they put out there and start looking at same store sales growth.,
northland.bluematrix.com/...This report explains that MM is shifting from a horizontal expansion mode to building vertically.  They seem to recognize the need to slow acquisitions and start building revenue.,
"The $1B 2020 projected annual revenue comes from Beacon, which seems realistic based on the anticipated growth. They currently have 69 licensed retail facilities, 17 of them in operation. Using back of the envelope calcs for future rev: 69 retail stores x $6,200/ft2 x 2000ft2 = $ 860 million/yr, which is in line with Beacon's estimates.  Plus they are looking to open stores in Canada, with a JV with CRON. Anyone who listened to their last CC knows they are clearly spending lots of money in order to gain first-mover advantage.  Remember BCG matrix (business 101)?  Mmen is currently in the ""question mark"" phase, looking to become a ""star"" and then in its lifecycle, at maturity, to a ""cash cow"".  Therefore, spending lots of money to expeditiously expand its footprint is expected; in fact, I would be concerned if they weren't spending.  The spending is inline with Canopy and Aurora.  Finally, if you look at their est. revenue, per quarter, $66/million seems more than reasonable.  This is obviously a very simplified analysis but it gives an idea where this company is going.  Beacon estimates in 2020 Mmen will be the highest generating US cannabis company. Also interesting fact, Mmen stores outperform non-Mmen stores by a factor of three.",
MM is in a huge pickle but what’s alarming is management is just now showing any sign of awareness.

I fear the same issue of ENCORE-PH in case the average MELD at baseline is lower than what is was with the successful cohort….,

Then Mento commented that now we got the same % reduction as for the POC if in the same condition: only compensated patients with HVPG mean baseline near to 21mmHg. Do you have evidence of this statement? The cohorts from ≥16 mmHg cohort had 2,3 mmHg reduction and about 20 mmHg average baseline...so the % reduction is not really 17%...What about competitors? Are you aware of better result in HVPG trails? Not GALT in my opinion, who saw no improvement last year in the full compensated population and is now going with exclusion of varices...Last question: Emricasan seems to work well for compensated patient with very high HVPG. No contradiction here? I thought that high HVPG is typical of decompensation so that we may have no big market for such compensated patients.",

NVS recently collaborated for NASH with PFE - was that an indication that the trial was not going well?Will they sink more money here or consider alternative?GALT seems only remaining player in NASH-CX,
"For me, the most disappointing part of the data was the complete failure in decompensated cirrhosis.  This is where Emricasan was supposed to shine.    Without seeing the full dataset, it seems that there was a large placebo effect among the decompensated patients where portal pressure actually DECREASED in a small sample size (n=11).  No other cohort in the placebo group showed a decrease.  It's not like Emricasan did a whole lot better. but the trial seemed to be plagued by a placebo effect similar to the F6 cohort in the POLT study where a small amount of the most diseased livers suddenly got better.  With that said, I think it's increasingly clear that Emricasan is not a standalone therapy.  While you could argue that the data is enough to get them to P3 with compensated cirrhosis and HVPG >12, I don't think NVS will fund that P3 trial and CNAT won't be able to raise enough money to do it themselves.   The next 2 readouts are likely generate similar data.  Works for a subset but not for the overall population.  So, it comes down to whether or not Emricasan has value in combination with a NVS drug.    Do you have any idea if there are any combination trials in the works?  Mento was kind of coy when asked the question.  He said something like, ""I didn't say we weren't doing it but I can't get into that that right now.""",
how does it compare with GALT option at this point ?,
What are the differences between ENCORE-PH extension vs ENCORE-LF?  LF has only decompensated but PH has both?   Thank you.     I think the only disease stages that need R&D for combo is decompensated   All the rest is E alone.  Baffled that >12mmHg did not work.,

"Thanks for the article FalohIt is always attractive to be the big fish in a highly fragmented market. However without delving too deep into S's financial it seems they have some built in challenges.   Besides being in a relatively low margin business, they are in a very cyclical business and at a glance it is evident that 90 % of their EBTDA is produced in 2 quarters per year, and 60 % takes place in quarter 2.It appears that one of the reason that this company is in such a fragmented business is because of the seasonality.   Low margin asset heavy and I'd not be surprised they have some substantial leverage.  Half the year they have too many employees too much warehouse space, too many employees, and expenses that exceed their income.Yet the business plan seems to be all about building up scale.  But the key to consolidating one business with another is to drive efficiency, mainly by shuttering or selling parts of the business that are low margin or duplicitous.    In terms of assets the key to a seasonal business is to find counter-cyclical business that pay for the cost of carrying all those assets and full time employees.""I am projecting a target price of $73 per share making for a potential compound annual return through 2023 of 4.3%.""Do you really believe given the risks of running this type of cyclical business are justified by a 4.3 % return compounded annually?",

When will we get the $25 dollar takeover from Home Depot that people are talking about?  stocktwits.com/...,
"Right now we have a rebalancing of multiples and for all the longs who say LL is cheap I somewhat disagree. You have large caps like T, VZ, XOM, WFC, and so forth all trading at 10x - 15x earnings. These are tried and tested businesses that can weather slowdowns and pay 3% plus yields. I mean one of my favorite energy stocks MPC is trading at like 8x earnings with a 3% yield, 10% dividend growth and running the best and biggest refinery in the USA. LL is projected to make .56 EPS next year according to analysts, but we can use the authors estimate of a full $1. I’m not really all familiar with LL so I can’t really say much about this prediction except it is bold being nearly two times what analysts project. And using the fact they made .23 cents in one quarter with no deeper explanation doesn’t exactly translate as evidence that $1 EPS next year is feasible, at least for me. But we can use the $1 EPS just to show how overvalued this stock could be. In a highly competitive business with I’d say mediocre growth prospects for LL, no dividend, why am I paying 10x earnings for that when an economic slowdown could wipeout all my earnings? Why is this worth 20-30x earnings? Vs some of the other stocks out there there’s no way that ever makes sense to pay that multiple. The thesis on the short squeeze makes sense, I will say that. But I’m not sure even $1 EPS is a catalyst to command 20x earnings. Why would you pay that? Assuming money was infinite. You look to purchase a business. Why would you pay 20x earnings on a business in this environment, this industry, this economically fragile - when you could pay 12x Wells Fargo which stands to gain from higher rates, pays a dividend, and has almost no risk of going out of business. My last point is that FND acquisition is a LONG shot. They have way different business models and FND uses warehouse format stores whereas LL has very small stores. FND would be better off staying the course and killing them off just by being way better which they are.",

"Great article - thanks.For mine, the stock is only moderately rather than compellingly cheap though, given that they have net debt of 5x NPAT, and are only paying 5% pre-tax on it, and are still in delevering mode. It will take them 5 years to pay off their debt and it will only boost earnings by some 15% from interest cost savings (after tax). So you have a high starting point equity FCF yield, but a low return on reinvested capital until they complete deleveraging. Assuming they pay down say half of it before commencing buy backs/higher dividends, the current 7x multiple is more equivalent to 9-9.5x adjusting for necessary deleveraging. That's still on the cheap side if they can stabilise earnings or even return to modest growth, but balancing that, there are also a lot of strategic risks given the amount of change happening in the industry, and the explosion in new content being produced (not just new distribution platforms). You make an excellent point that growing bidding competition for content positions them well, but it's also logical to argue that with so much new content being produced, at some point the amount being produced is going to exceed the capacity of people to consumer it, which will logically have the effect of devaluing it. I'd probably want to assume flat earnings moving forward, balancing these risks, so 9x adjusted for excess debt seems cheap but far from compelling imo. I'd rather own something like AMP at 8x, who are able to distribute all FCF immediately due to no debt/deleveraging overhang, and accept higher market-related cyclical risks, given much lower structural long term risks.

These false promises are a distraction to serious efforts to reduce plastic pollution through extended producer responsibility (EPR). The overall scheme to collect and process used PET bottles defies the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and Economics 101 in that it takes too much effort (energy) and costs too much to collect, clean and process billions of dispersed, contaminated beverage bottles when the price of new PET is cheap and getting cheaper.

I get that there are a lot of bulish signs, but my indicators were flashing red in September and I see more bear than bull right now. I just can't stomach going purely long on anything at the moment, not after 2008. Last year, 2017, I had no fears about a big crash. In 2018 I started worrying and playing directions. Yesterday, on that gap down on the 30 min chart I saw too strong of a bounce so I got out of my shorts and went long. I closed my leveraged positions at close but kept some puts. Today on the rip up I saw too strong a bounce and so got out of those and went straight back into shorts. That is paying off right now and that is how I plan to play this for a while. Takes a bit of stomaching but I really don't want to see a 40% loss on my cap investments if I actually bought the companies that I like. On major (I mean, really big) market moves, all go down. The tide may rise all ships, but a hurricane takes no prisoners. So, today, puts on SVXY $50 strike, calls on TZA 10 strike, flat out purchase of VXX at 38.10. I waited a bit for that initial down move, started shorting about an hour ago. To those interested, I like to short those bullish or bearish 3x ETNs since there is time decay because of the fees involved. The call on TZN was because I found options trading right at the money that were cheap (it happens at times, maybe someone went for a coffee and didn't have the algo running, who knows..)I think the 24% Fib retracement is going to bracket the bottom for the next few days, maybe to X-mas.

We may have hit bottom at $5 and $12.50 and oil at $42. ECA really needs to start selling its Canadian assets. Has  $500 million bond debt due May 2019. Only $600 million cash on September 30. Probably less with oil down so much in last two months and will stay low for a while. No way to do buy back and payoff debt without sales. If they would get out of Canada they could become a real player.,
Is the stock issuance to buy NFX based on the price when it was announced or at current low prices?,
Well I see you didn’t write the SA article Todd did. Good article about all the good things NFX offers but not a word about what ECA brings to the table. His problem is he thinks it has already been completed. Guess he forgot to talk to management yesterday.,
Yep I have . I had hoped you had written a SA article on the merger. I’m in average $15.71 NFX and with my shares I owned before merger average price $23 my average price for NFX is $18.14 so getting close with NFX up to $16.50 today. If merger occurs my all in average in ECA will be $6.78 with ECA at $6.53 right now only need another $.25 for me to be even on the fiasco. So I applaud you. However if management talked to you and told you anything yesterday other than board hasn’t changed it’s mind which it can’t without paying $300 breakup fee then may be some other problems for you and management. Keep pushing it I need another $.25. Thanks,
"I’ve been buying NFX over 10,000 shares below $16 because I can win big with no vote. If yes still be ok just not as good . Something big going on now maybe breakup announcement coming . NFX up almost 5% with oil pulling back .",
Well you get your big dividend tomorrow. You can buy another share for every 500 shares you own . If USA citizen Canada withholds 25% of that dividend so takes almost 600 shares . At least you are buying around $6 a share instead of the $10.50 you had 45 days ago. Can’t wait for the next 45 days. Humm $3.00 a share?,
Glad ECA and NFX put out prospectus on Dec 4 a Friday night. Was such good reading that in three days ECA went from $6.75 to $6.17. NFX went from $17.23 to $15.58 both down 10%.  Oh oil touched $50.09 on Dec 4 now almost $53 up 6%. Doesn’t look like info in prospectus gonna help the slide to $4.,
sorry I bought ECA in early 2016 in the 3-5 range and did very well. buy low and sell high!  thanks,
Can hardly wait. Let’s see ECA hasn’t made any money in last two years other than by selling off assets. Let’s sell all the assets so we can keep losing money. And that was with oil prices on the rise. Can’t wait to see ECA s plan for losing money with dropping oil prices. I guess sell twice as fast at distressed prices. Wake up you are being fleeced and have been for last five years. My only hope is that NFX shareholders will see they are being fleeced. If not then I’m down the tube with you my friend. I just have faith shareholders will do the right thing. Still buying NFX . If deal goes through then will look for chance to get out after it closes.,
Boy market up 250 pts oil up2.5% all oil stocks up nicely and ECA down $.02. The prospectus reads like a funeral eulogy. Trying to make deal look good  but nothing but bad news for NFX . Dividends if any will be subject to 25% withholding no matter US tax much lower. Taxable event on closing. Selling company for $3.1 billion dollars that’s 1.1 times annualized revenue. Only profits for combined company will be generated by NFX as ECA has no profits to contribute. But wait NFX management will get huge additional gain from deal . These guys must have been former Enron mid managers trying to make their mark. The more I read the sicker I get. Start thinking $35 a share and end up with $15 if lucky with no protection from market forces. Every BK starts this way making a bad deal at peak oil price then sticking with it. ECA will suck NFX dry trying to pay off its debt and cover its expenses. Hard to watch good company like NFX be taken down by ECA . Just let it go so both can make proper plans for 2019. Both are hamstrung by the merger and can’t make needed decisions because no way deal will go thru but can’t make plans to go on without it.,
What is the impact to eca ?,
On the proxy there is a nice day by day breakdown of the negotiations that lead to the deal. Encana initially offered 2.3946 shares on Oct 29th then upped it by about 11.7% to 2.6917 to seal the deal on Oct 31st. It was unanimously approved then and both sides agreed on all terms and conditions.,
May get ECA under $6 on its own,
Time to pull the trigger $15.62 for NFX equals $5.84 for ECA,
I’m starting to back the truck up on ECA and NFX. It’s time.,
Deal is all but done. Both BOD's were unanimously in favor when they approved the merger. Most of the decline after the first one to two days of the announcement of the deal has been because of the collapse in oil not because of the deal. Both management teams know the potential of the combined companies. Which is why the struck the merger agreement. Saying they would buy back $1.5 billion in stock post deal shows how much cash they are going to be generating. All oil drillers have been crushed during the past couple of months. Pick any and compare. I see maybe 10% more downside and over 100% upside being we were the about 2 months ago. Crazy.  Yes we will get about 450 million additional shares in dilution but a huge increase in revenue and great NFX profits will more than make up for it. Started buying this past week and am long 16.2k shares at $6.79 US...,
I think that was done at the worst of time . And the focus should be on oil price now not the merge . I didn’t see any good quality update in SA except this one and believe the writer will write more . Can anyone tell me the narrowing of wti/wcs helps eca . Of course the natural gas price should help,
Sorry mkozberg but nothing filed other than supplemental BS about merger which was just same charts and bull crap they showed with announcement. That was put out Nov 7 2018. Come on the combined 1.5 billion shares have lost 4 points from a little over 10 to barely over 6 . That’s 6 billion dollar loss in value. What a wonderful deal. Let it go will never pass and both companies have been destroyed by paralysis of merger. No one can say anything in management other than oops what a screw up so sorry I wiped out all the value in both companies. What morons .,
Preliminary proxy has been filed,
I am voting no on the merger. A failed deal may help Doug focus on shareholder value. From $18 to below $7 during his tenure is shameful.,
mergers are punished in these markets,
Strange how quiet ECA and NFX are about merger. NFX has not even set a date for the shareholders to vote and no prospectus for shareholders to review before vote. Going to be hard to close in first qtr. if they don’t get rolling. Management won’t even answer any written questions I have sent them about merger. Simple questions that they should be disclosing now. SEC may have a real good time with this if some transparency is not forthcoming.,
Sorry but the hedge funds are already on board.,
ECA will really need NFX merger to be viable going forward. Increase their revenues by more than $2.6 billion add over  $600 million profit in 2019 without the $250 million savings they are proposing . Problem is unless they up their offer to NFX to more than 3 for 1 the NFX shareholders will vote it down. Even arbs know NFX will jump straight up if merger cancelled,
It makes sense for ECA to limit development of this play to the liquids rich part till western Canada gets some LNG export capability. Western Canada is a wash in Natural gas and producing more at this time makes no sense. ECA has wisely decided to produce from its most profitable assets and focus investment on assets that should also be very profitable (NewField) while leaving assets like the gassy part of Duvernay in the bank (so to speak) till they can generate top profits. Its a very smart move on their part as LNG export is coming to BC and that will make development of these assets much more profitable.,

In Hope phase 3 study it looks like 6 of 7 ‘Hg responders’ showed some level of decrease in TCD through 24 weeks, but all were in normal range. For Non Hg responders TCD appears to increase. Hope they have enough data and good statisticians to design a study with sufficient sample size to demonstrate statistically significant impact on TCD.",
A well written well balanced article.  GBT is a high risk investment with little to no pipeline outside of the current drug mentioned in this article.  Investors should be in a position to absorb large loses if the drug was to not receive approval or approval was delayed for an extended period.  The low float (less than 60 million shares after the new offering) provides significant upside to the current stock price if the drug was to be approved in 2019.  IMO utilizing options around the news cycle is a good way to reduce your average price and manage some of the risk on GBT.  Of course this is all just my two cents.Disclosure:  I'm long GBT and recently wrote covered calls on 80% of my position.  Slow and steady!  Good luck to all!,

"Watching fast money last night, 2 of the folks on the panel wouldn't touch T due to it's debt.  They also suspect divi over long term as being not being viable?  Concerning!",
"With T's revenue declining across the board, their focus should be a very aggressive cost cutting initiative.  Commodity businesses as they have need commodity cost structures.  A quasi governmental body that has layers of management and many sloth like movers, outdated retiree health benefits and way way overpaid executives (considering their bottom quartile decade long performance).  Getting serious about costs considering revenue dropping about the only way the bext decade doesnt end up in the performance tally like the last.",

The first thing i do when beginning an article on Seeking Alpha is to go to the end of the article to see if the author has any skin in the game. I thought your article was excellent and agree with your conclusions (I have a full position in T). I noticed from your bio that you are or were a hockey player. You can't be a good player or a great player if you are not in the game.,
"I am long T with a full position. Looking at Y charts...price to yield comparisons...this is the best time to buy since about 2011.  Present yield according to Yahoo is 6.81%...5 year average yield according to Yahoo is 5.28%. 10 year T Bill pays about 3%...payout ratio 38.02% according to yahoo...Earnings yield 16.87%. Those are just some things that stuck out to me. If price of T stays down...I will continue to buy and enjoy the dividend payment. Intelligent, astute investors need to keep in mind that T’s national first responder network will be huge, 5G will be a game changer, IOT will be beneficial as well....and then add in all of the other segments of their business and you have the complete package. All stocks carry risks...but from what I see...the risk reward is in the investors favor at this time...give management time to execute the plan...I think we will be well rewarded for our investing patience!",
"Here is 'an out of the box' idea for AT&T. Much of the current debt is near or below 5% per year. As an example the baby bond TBB has a face coupon value of 5.3%. Based on the current stock price the dividend yield is 6.55%. Maybe AT&T should take the extra FCF, beyond their initial projections, and buy back shares. If you are confident in AT&T as a very long term investment this would be the best use of a portion of estimated FCF. The window would be short as buying back shares would no doubt buoy confidence and send the stock price higher in a short time.",

They better operate more like Amazon and less like GE.",
"Montgomery Ward, Sears, General Electric, AT&T",
"I think you are missing a key point in respect to the share price being beaten down. The debt load is an issue but not the most important issue.  The elephant in this room is T’s past failures in digesting acquisitions. IMO, given the fact management has not fared well outside of organic growth, the discount factor in the DCF modeling of future cash streams has been elevated, thereby decreasing NPV.This has been exacerbated by the poor job they have done in digesting the acquisition of DirectTv. They overpaid for this satellite platform and did mot recognize they would have to change the delivery model to a streaming service instead of satellite BEFORE they bought it.That change is costing additional capital investment, thereby further decreasing the potential ROI on the acquisition of DirectTv. They now have a streaming service called DirectTV Now.High debt or not, if T does not get its act together and is successful at digesting the Time Warner acquisition, the share price will remain depressed well into the future.",
"I'd have to disagree with the statement that T has a ""stable mobile business"" in that 1) they stink as a mobile supplier, 2) their mobile business is under brutal assault from every angle with new, cheaper, better providers popping up consistently, and 3) they seem to hate their customers and do not hesitate to lie/cheat/steal from them thereby validating all the terrible things that people who were willing to give them a chance had heard about them and feared.   Customers are running away from them.  Do a simple web search - you wouldn't believe the horrible ways T is abusing customers.  I too believe they threw massive good money after a terrible satellite business and have saddled the company with a losing, very costly acquisition which they'll probably have to write-off one day.  If they could only find a way to deliver reliable high-speed, inexpensive internet service via satellite (that works when it rains) or even via the massive legacy network of landlines they might have something but I believe others will very soon find alternative ways to blanket the world with 5G service thereby taking that opportunity.  Enjoy your T dividend for a while but this company is sick, akin to a body with rapidly metastasizing cancer.",
Wait until 2019 and $25 and if the dividend is cut to help service the debt you can get it at $18.,
"Just under a year ago, I posted in the comments on an article claiming that T is a better investment than VZ. I disagreed with the author's thesis, arguing that T's debt would be a significant problem. Since that time, VZ (which I own), has done very well whereas T has not. However, I now feel that the price of T has come down enough to make it a viable investment, and I bought shares of T at midday today when the market was down. Despite this, I disagree with the author's prediction of 21% annual returns over a 5 year period. T has a lot of debt, and T has recently paid a lot of money for assets which may not be competitive in today's changing media industry. With this in mind, I do not think that an organic earnings CAGR of 5% over the next five years is realistic. Still, I am hopeful that T will return more than a 5 year US government bond (2.79% annually) over the next 5 years.In general, I am quite bearish on the market right now. Valuations are stretched, and many stocks will probably yield negative returns over the next 5 years. Given the cheap price and stable business model, I am hopeful that T will buck this trend and produce positive (though unimpressive) returns over the next 5 years.",
"Agree and hope you are right as  I  add shares at each new low point, and this has been wrong move so far.    But love div's, as I should, now being retired.     But agree with a comment above   -   all analysis and projections are meaningless until  the merger and appeal are  completed.   Any buy's such as mine are based on a favorable merger outcome for T.    After this uncertainty is over, then we can better look at businesses, growth, debt, yield etc.  and project a hopefully higher target price.

As always great analysis Carlton!  Thanks for sharing this with us!,
"Thanks Carlton, a great article as always, it gives me some comfort that the store closures will offset loss profits from the overall declining revenue, which I suspect we have not seen the bottom of yet.Another positive point if I may add; in one of the conference calls Ken said that online sales are being tracked –and commissions paid- to the stores where the customer used to buy, this was probably done on the protests of the stores, when they close stores the part that gets recaptured online, is probably higher margin because nobody gets commission on it.",
"Also, GNC now needs fewer stores because of growing ecommerce sales. Most regular customers of closed stores can go to nearby locations, as well. This can help reduce inventory, a bit. I think it is a smart move they are making. They can focus more attention on the better stores and close the underperformers.",
"Announcing a store closure count helps negotiate rent leases. They are only closing less than 10 percent of total stores. Meanwhile, they plan to open thousands more overseas. Store turnover is just par for the course, especially for franchise retailers. I sense some extra pessimism in recent GNC equity analysis. It appears to be short-termers and traders, as there is often a focus on near-term supposed trends and directions. It should also be noted that GNC could be a good bargain buy here, however, especially for long term fundamental value investors unafraid of volatility. Consider the strengths of the company, as well as their challenges. Looks like the pendulum swung too far on this oversold stock to me.",
"@Carlton Getz, CFA Thanks for a very good article again. 1) I do think it is the right thing to do to shrink the current store size while evaluating the new store business model. 2) I think the future store value should be more than just selling products, it should extend services to users and other brands which Amazon cannot do. 3) I agree with you the stock is undervalued.",

Any thoughts on how might make up the lost sales of ~50 million per year as a result of store closing?,
I honestly didn't read the article so I apologize in advance if my comment here isn't relevant. I wouldn't put much faith in GNC's forecasts on store closures until they show at least 2-3 quarters worth of progress to plan. Their prior forecasts on store franchising efforts during the 2016-2017 time period were wildly off the mark. I'd take a wait and see approach. Good luck.,

Why dollar general over dollar tree,
"DG does a lot of business in small towns such as ours but I’ve noticed they don’t necessarily do the best demographic research or even pricing competition.. Example, they had a section of African American hair care products despite the fact that 99.7% of the population of our town is white. There are exactly 3 minority families in the entire town, in fact I’m friends with the African American one since I’ve known him since I was a kid and I’ve never once run into him or his family at Dollar General (it’s not uncommon in a small town to run into people either). That didn’t prevent DG from retaining a complete 4 foot section of the hair care products for several years, which I can effectively guess no one bought.They don’t really shop the competition well as a lot of their groceries are more expensive than a small local grocery store we have their hours are very similar.Their merchandise mix is too standardized across the board to a point elsewhere. It’s mainly just a convenience thing but there are a lot of dead merchandise items (prepaid cell phones around here don’t sell either) that just tie up space. Some of the further out DGs have slightly more merchandise and some of that stuff would sell better here. I’ve noticed it at another location one town away which also has stuff that just doesn’t make sense demographically. DG has room to improve yet. If they iron the product selection out to cater better to where the stores are located (such as small urban stores) there is plenty of room to grow.",

The safety record in particular is “reassuring,” says Caron Jacobson, who treats leukemia and lymphoma patients at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, one of the top country’s top CAR-T centers. Side effects from the aggressive cancer-killing cells have been a major concern for doctors.The other approved CAR-T, tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) from Novartis, has hit major snags. While its clinical results were also strong, Kymriah has been used far less in the real world. Novartis has had problems manufacturing the complicated product, which, like Yescarta, requires a patient’s T cells to be extracted, genetically modified in a lab, nurtured so the cell population expands, and shipped back to the patient.",

Listening to the company's conferences really helps one understand how promising a company it is.Hopefully today we will get a slight boost to the share price. Question is, what is the next catalyst after the R&D day? Not counting the chance of another partnership announcement it would seem that the next major catalysts are a while away. Biotech trades on news and however much the company is undervalued perhaps it is worth reducing positions during the upcoming catalyst desert and re-entering later? Any thoughts?Also regarding the partnership, one gets the impression that Adi is determined to show more data, presumably for AFM24, before agreeing to better terms than are perhaps currently on the table. In which case, new partnerships may not be so immediate. They certainly aren't constrained for funds for the moment. Again, any thoughts welcome.",

"The primary issue is a lack of re-invention, a lack of evolution in how they merchandise the store.  GAP was at its peak in a market devoid of Amazon, Old Navy, Primark and the athleisure trend.  They had good product, very good color management, great marketing, and very little competition for solid everyday wear.  They figured out very quickly that Old Navy was going to cannibalize the GAP, so GAP started a many year journey of a ""fashion"" lane that could work for them.  Not to be found.  So they have now shunned risk returned to a 15-20 year old formula, except the market is now much more competitive.  In addition to the retailers I mentioned above, Kohl's and Target have upped their game substantially.  Old Navy is nailing it.  And the very low risk position that GAP takes does nothing to differentiate them in the market.  I'll call it a ""15% problem"".  Much of GAP's product is good...to very good.  It's just boring.  If they managed about 15% of their inventory into more fun and interesting looks it would change the whole personality of the store.  It's a function of making risk your friend.  It's understanding that risk is a differentiator and a brand builder.  I wrote a Seeking Alpha article to this effect last May and have articles on LinkedIn with this theme.  And even if GAP didn't want to do this for the full range of stores all at once, they could quietly test it in a market or two.  It might take a year or more for the customer to recognize the difference, but for the long term it would be well worth it.  Safe and boring is not a good long term strategy right now.",

"I have a major problem with the whole thesis of the article, which is deliberately misleading with regards to the ""facts"":""Tesla is growing revenues at 38% in 2019, while GM is flat and Ford is slightly negative. In addition, Tesla operates at ~22% gross margins, GM operates at ~12%, and Ford operates at ~10%.""That is all false.  It is all hypothetical projections - analyst forecasts.  Author uses made-up projections of revenues and margins for NEXT YEAR, and then treats it as if it is current fact.  Tesla is most certainly NOT operating at a ~22%  gross margin.  The Author BELIEVES that Tesla MIGHT operate at ~22% gross margin NEXT YEAR, based on bizarre and unsupportable statements from one Elon Musk, who has a chronic and longstanding history of flat lies and massive distortion and exaggerations, not to mention an utter hatred of the SEC who he believes is trying to interfere with his right to LIE to shareholders and the media.  The Author pretends that the 22% margin projections from Musk is a current reality, and that is just utterly false and misleading.Same for the numbers for Ford and GM.So as an example, Ford was expected to show 5% lower revenues this year, due to slowing car sales.  But so far, Ford's 2018 revenues are 2.6% higher, due to higher sales of trucks (+3.2%), utilities (1.1%), and commercial vehicles with relatively higher transaction prices, regardless of flagging sales of cars (-17.4%) at lower transaction prices.  The same analysts may well be forecasting Ford's 2019 revenues to fall by 1.2%, presumably from this year's +2.6% (ytd).  But based on what?  Faulty assumptions around flagging car sales, even as trucks and utilities continue to grow?Point is, Author is valuing the automakers based on Musk's exaggerated and endorsed projections for sales, revenues, and profits, rather than anything approaching facts and reality.",

"@MangoTree Analysis Good effort on the continued bull-bear argument over Tesla. There is only one area of your report where there are some irrefutable flaws, and that is in your table above comparing Tesla with Ford & GM in terms of profitability and solvency. First, in your comparison of Tesla versus Ford & GM, you use the Altman Z Score to show how Tesla is more solvent than Ford & GM. I would point out that the Altman Z Score (where, the higher the score, the more solvent and financially robust a company is) is not reliable. Pioneer, the Japanese consumer electronics company, currently sports an Altman Z Score of 2.2 versus Tesla’s 1.3, Ford’s 0.98 and GM’s 0.98. Although its net debt as a % of equity was only 30% at the end of September, Pioneer wrote in its financial statements that it was short on cash and needed a “partner” in order to survive. The stock is down 76% year-to-date. I prefer to use net debt/equity ratios for a quick look at financial health, which of course need to be supported by FCF outlook. At Q3-end, Ford had net cash of $2.3bn (auto division only, with unfunded pension liabilities included) with equity of $37bn and GM had a net debt debt/equity ratio of only 7% (net debt of $2.9bn and equity of $41bn). Tesla, when stripping out customer deposits (which it counts in its cash & equivalent account), had a net debt/equity ratio of 192%, with its net debt of $8.7bn nearly double its equity of $4.5bn. Tesla’s 5.3 senior bond is rated Caa1 (junk) by Moody’s, while Ford has a Baa3 rating and GM has a Baa2 rating, for what it's worth (probably not much, as all the credit rating agencies got the subprime loan debacle wrong). Lastly, gross margin comparisons between Tesla and its rival are a moot point, as Tesla books R&D at the SG&A level (thereby giving it a higher gross margin), while GM and Ford book theirs at the COGS level, thereby depressing their gross margins. The best way to compare profitability is the “bottom line”, or the net profit margin. For the 9 months ended on September 30th, Tesla had a cumulative net loss of -$845m (stripping out ZEV & other regulatory credits, while adding back stock-based compensation), which amounts to a -6.5% net margin. Over the same period, Ford had an automotive (ex-finance subsidiary) net margin of 3.2%, while GM had a net margin of 6.1%. As a Tesla bull like yourself, the charging network, better looking cars than rivals, etc. points are all very valid arguments and a source of continued debate. But when it comes to profitability and financial solvency, it’s very straight-forward: Tesla is on fragile ground.",

In Ct we have a $2k tax rebate for EVs so adding that to the half FIT rebate in 2019 makes for $5.75k rebate which will not materially impact the sale of EVs in Ct but in 2020 its another story.There is just so much demand for $50k cars and it will be exhausted in 2019 for the most part so that I predict 2020 will be a collapse for Tesla from this factor in the US; until the China factory comes on line there will be no $35k M3.   However international sales especially in China ramping up in 2020 will compensate for this factor even in the face of competition given the first mover image of Tesla and the increased quality those two years will give the brand and could become a Chinese company.Overall Tesla will still be with us in 2020 and beyond...................,

"@MangoTree Analysis My headings will follow yours.Profit.“Profitability was rare; a 1-off event.”  The only kind of profit that truly matters is one that pays dividends, preferably at every year’s end.  No such profit has occurred.The other purpose of profit is to increase the shareholders’ equity.  Tesla has increased its cash flows, but certainly not its shareholders’ equity – primarily because it has a worsening loans position and because of dilution resulting from high rates of issue of new shares to meet debt or as remuneration for employees.   There has never in 15 years been anything left over for the very patient shareholders.Executive departures.“41 executive departures year-to-date is a scary number.”  Agreed.  No cause for confidence in that number.Autonomous driving.Essentially autonomous driving, whether it finally arrives in 5 years or 10, is currently irrelevant.  It is still not available despite multiple promises and both the software and the hardware are currently not up to the task.  Any technical advantages that Tesla once could claim now have very large question marks hanging over them.FSD/AUtopilot is best valued at its current practical and realisable valuation, which is nil.The argument that vehicle safety must be expected to drop during a transition period is simply silly.  Of course that isn’t the way to behave.  FSD aims to be a safety device, not a step backwards to the unsafe period of a century ago, before we knew how to make safer motor vehicles.  Safety systems should be as safe as reasonably possible, which leaves no excuse for half-developed systems that might or might not work eventually.  Until FSD, by any name, exceeds the ""currently reasonably possible"" standard it has no place in public hands on public roads.Billions of miles of data.What data?  Tesla has been reported as saying that in California they have not collected any test data – none – in the past year or two.   What matters is not how many miles these toys have travelled, but what the purpose and value of any data collected actually is.  This is not a trivial question, because as currently presented by Tesla, any data that they have is primarily used only as a PR tool in an ill-informed marketplace.What we do know is that neither the hardware nor the software are ready for release, regardless of the millions or billions of miles of so-called data.I’m an engineer, not a salesman.  I like my data to be not cherry-picked, complete, supported by analysis and available for independent review and interpretation.If I was a road safety regulator I’d want no less.  So, like Tesla’s “profits” which rely on highly selective and ultimately irrelevant data points, the self-driving capabilities of Tesla remain unverifiable and valueless.Competition.“Basically, the competition thesis relies on the belief that Tesla's technology will not improve over time. This assumption is most likely false.”Tesla has no technological advantage which will not disappear over time.Volume of production 5,000 per week?  So what, with a hundred competitors coming within 5 or 6 years?  If that does not foreshadow a future global excess in production capability within a very short period, then I am very much mistaken.Supercharger sites?  A range of standardised, cross-compatible charging facilities, both larger and smaller, are very much on the way.  They are now in Asia and Europe and commencing in America.  Tesla’s best sites may still be better than the opposition’s average sites for several years, but it is a bet against the odds to expect that Tesla’s advantage is more than temporary. Valuation and Short Squeezes. Individual investors make their own call.  Not all are rational and even the smart and rational can still be wrong or misled.  IMHO, any share price that is a large multiple of the net asset value plus the sum of present values of expected future earnings is gambling, not investing.My call is that Tesla’s share price has been in the gambling zone pretty much since the day Tesla was first floated.  Talk of short squeezes is either academic (no skin in the game) or speculation (no brains in the game).  The true value of a share is not determined or influenced by the presence or absence of a “short squeeze”.  Astute investors with sufficient patience are well positioned to wait, not for a short squeeze, but for the sum of net asset backing and value of future dividend stream to build profits.",

"With Tesla's fabulous 3rd quarter and drumbeat of growth and glory in Q4 and beyond, Tesla longs are taking well-deserved victory laps here in Seeking Alpha.  The few doubters still willing to pipe up are being drowned out by commenters licking their chops at the prospect of Jim Chanos acolytes being burned at the short stake.This article raises some doubts about Tesla but goes on to dismiss them all. Tesla rules, the short case is dead and buried.  Will 2019 see Tesla stock at $420? No, maybe $570. And as Ark Capital suggests, $1,000 is just around the corner.I am not short and acknowledge Tesla is humming and seems to have achieved sustainable bottom line black ink. That said, I think odds are pretty high that Tesla will face some real bumps in the road over the next several years and the current stock price reflects nothing but future perfection. For one, sales growth could slow significantly or even plateau in late 2019 and most of 2020. Tesla is capacity constrained -- the company is struggling to push output in Fremont beyond 5,000 or 6,000 a week, and there is no guarantee it will reach the 10,000 cars/week rate predicted by Musk. The Chinese are now saying production will be roaring in Shanghai by late 2019, but Tesla is notorious for production ramp up delays. If meaningful production is delayed in Shanghai until late 2020, not unlikely, Tesla revenues may show tepid growth from 2018 through 2020. That could ding the stock price noticeably. Also, growth in 2019 and 2020 is basically reliant on the Model 3 --  Model S and X are old designs, their sales have been flat for a while. There is no room in Fremont to build the Model Y, the Roadster or the Semi, and obtaining/designing/ramping up a new US production facility is a three year, $3 billion project. The Model 3 may continue to show strong growth in the US and will certainly sell in Europe soon, but there are reasons to think sales in the US could flatten out in 2019 -- it is a terrific car but it is a high-priced sedan which is just not a massive segment of the car market. Yes, SVInvestor2, Reuniter and other Tesla bulls will scoff at my risk factors, but I think chances are at least 50/50 that Tesla growth and stock price will stumble in 2019/2020.",

"@MangoTree Analysis >Not to mention, Tesla's solvency is improving with every quarter that goes by as long as the company delivers profits and cash flows. To value Tesla, a growth stock betting on arguably the future of the auto industry against teetering titans like Ford and GM is an irrational move.In my opinion this is the biggest flaw in your article.  First, you are drawing a conclusion from a sample size of one.  More importantly Tesla may be a growth stock, but it's fundamentally a car company with a 20% gross margin, not a tech company where doubling revenue means +500% profits due to the near zero unit costs of software.  Your own numbers suggest that the market is valuing Tesla like a $10 billion a year auto company.  That's 10x growth from Q3 baked into the stock price.  Tesla is at the top of it's channel right now, so the bulls are crowing, but I think most of the movement is just algorithms trying to run everyone's stops.  I was waiting for a short squeeze earlier, but at this point I think enough traders view every new algo-driven high as an opportunity to short.  I could be wrong again, of course.The other big part of the bear case that you aren't covering is capital: manufacturing cars requires lots of it.  Tesla has more or less maxed out the Fremont plant and needs to build more factories, more service centers, more superchargers.  They need a billion or so to cover the cars that will be in transit to Europe, and another two billion to pay off 2019 loans.  That's what? 5-6 billion in 2019? 300 million a quarter in profits will not cover this. From a business perspective there isn't anything wrong with needing capital, but if they borrow the money at their current junk rating of 10%, that's -500M a year, or about half their profits.  If they dilute, that's 10% off the stock price right there.  The real question is why they haven't raised already, and the most likely answer is that no one wants to touch them with a 10 foot pole due to the various Federal investigations.So to me the bear case is extremely intact:  * Tesla makes and sells 5K-6K Model 3's a week, but gross margins on the M3 fall to 10-15% due to cherry picking the high ASP variants in Q3, introduction of the short range, and tax cuts expiring.  * Supercharger and service networks are increasingly overloaded, and any profits are immediately sucked up there  * Growth flat lines because they don't have more factories (it's not impossible China/Tesla will prove me wrong by building Shanghai in 6 months, but I don't think it's likely)  * Tesla stock heads back to $250.  * Shorts are crowing while the bulls quietly lick their wounds.  * Cycle repeats.I don't think these are super aggressive assumptions.",
"Thank you for a lovely, detailed article.  However, all your concepts are in doubt because you used ""flea"" rather than ""flee"".  Ok, that's my bear side, always rational.  Now for a few minor additions to your excellent work.Autopilot:  A very important question is whether their (not ""there"" as SO many bloggers and participants use) bet on enhanced radar rather than Lidar will pan out.  Secondly, and I think a very important point, is that Elon has said he thinks they have the only relatively near-term chance for a GENERAL (my emphasis, but that's the only explanation for using that term) solution.  The Lidar folks seem to be going with a narrow geofenced solution, thus the comment from Waymo that a Level 5 (maybe even 4+?)  solution is years away.  The Tesla advantage in their approach, if successful, would give them at least a significant cost advantage due to no Lidar, and if they can achieve a general (level 5?) solution, it's hard to overstate the possibilities.Supercharger: I think there is a somewhat significant difference in it's advantage between the USA and Europe/China.  First, we place a higher importance on long distance driving.  Second, Europe is ahead of the USA in building charging networks and the Chinese government will probably drive a very fast implementation for their country.  Another reason that differentiation is important is that private homes with charging capability are fewer in percentage in Europe/China, thus the ability to do normal daily charging necessitates far more public stations than in the U.S.Competition: Agree that Tesla's quality advantage is significant, but other countries really prefer to buy home-grown products.  Tesla will maintain some advantage over other manufacturers in the near term and possibly over the longer term, similar to the advantages the quality European and Asian manufacturers developed over American vehicles, but sales possibilities will be limited to some extent by ""buy-local"".The Elephant approaching the room:  If Autonomous vehicles are truly successful (read the brilliant report ""A RethinkX Sector Disruption Report May 2017 James Arbib & Tony Seba"". overall sales of vehicles could plummet, because the vast majority of travel might be done via fleet autonomous taxis that would be so much cheaper.

Then Ford made, along with the other manufacturers cars that were only for the very rich. Then Ford came out with the Model T. Tesla never had a model failure, and are now getting to the point they can not only show a profit but are restarting their energy division products as they need progressively less focus time on the Model 3 now. The Model 3 is the Tesla ""Model T"" equivalent. See I remember when a Jag XKE cost about $4500 in the 60s loaded. MY first house cost 19k in a nice neighborhood in 1975. In a few years the petroleum biz will be out, and the trillions they get in Subsidies will be back in the treasury. And the oil barons can't charge us capricious prices as oil ramps down. Let's remember that BEVs have only one moving engine part that does not need explosions at high heat and pressures. Virtually no maintenance. Even the brakes can be lifetime if one sets the regenerative braking high like I prefer. My zero turn mower has no brakes! Doesn't need them. Tesla vehicles will need to replace wiper blades and tires. No heat stressed arts like turbos, exhaust systems, manifolds, oil filters, air filters, belts and pullys, smog controls, Catalytic convertors, none of that ICE age stuff. And no greasy stealership salespeople to deal with. They are just a middle man that adds cost and makes nothing but mechanics available to service the entropic ICE vehicles.Koch brothers and Tesla shorts, you will get what you have coming, and not what you planned.",
"@MangoTree AnalysisVery well written article - though I am already firmly in TSLA long territory already - for the reasons listed in this article and more.I would LOVE to read a deep analysis of the EV battery supply situation.  Most short/long articles ignore this as an issue - if anything, focusing only on the price of batteries.  But what I'm reading indicates battery supply chain as a MAJOR hindrance to  any meaningful Tesla competition.What I read:1.  Tesla is currently producing over 50% of all EV batteries world-wide and is able to produce about 300k vehicles per year with that.2.  BYD is currently producing about 25% of the remaining EV battery pool - all BYD EV batteries are spoken for by BYD car production.3.  Both TESLA and BYD are actively working on expansion of EV battery production, no other car maker does.4.  LG Chem - who has the second best/cheapest batteries after Panasonic/Tesla - announced expected EV battery cost INCREASE due to ""sustained, high demand"" for their product.  All analysis I've read to date assume battery price decline for Tesla competition.5.  Analysts confuse General ""lithium ion"" battery production (aimed at PC's and mobile devices) with EV Lithium ion battery production.  the 2 battery types are not interchengable.6.  If numbers in item 1 and 2 are valid - ALL remaining EV batteries on the market can power about 150k vehicles - spread around ALL competition auto makers.Can anyone comment on this in meaningful way?",
"Dont' worry short sellers are still spreading fake news in the hopes that it will crash Tesla stock, like the most recent BI story about racism prevalent throughout the company. Incredible stuff. Didn't catch much wind though.",
"The stock was above $300 per share when the CEO said it was only weeks away from bankruptcy.  This tells me the stock price is somewhat disconnected from the fundamentals of the underlying business.  I can't think of another company valued at 50 billion that is weeks from bankruptcy.  Tesla is like a Van Gogh painting valued at millions, and then it's found to be a fake.  Just because people are willing to pay a lot for something, doesn't mean it's actually worth that much.",
"It's after Dec. 1st, and the stock is above $359, can it now be observed to what extent those Mar2019 bondholders are converting to shares ?",
"The road (since the 1890s) is littered with upwards of 3,000 automakers who have come and gone.History tells us first mover advantage only lasts so long and as this plays out, more and more deep pockets players,  already outspending TSLA by upwards of 20 to 1 on future tech, will have competitive EVs ---  ultimately relegating TSLA to niche status and even worse.Go away and listen to ShamWow's BS at your own peril.",
"Oh there is still plenty of opportunity to play this stock on the swing trade. The chart swings up and down like a YoYo. This isn't a blue chip investment stock, this is a day trade. Short the peaks, cover when it drops $100, ride the spike back up and rinse and repeat. Buying at $360 and holding for $4000 isn't going to make any money, same with shorting at $360 and holding for bankruptcy. If there are two things that The Elon has proven he can do: One is he can pump stock better than anyone in the modern era (The opposite is also true, no one can kill the stock price quicker than a bone headed tweet from The Elon) and the other thing is that The Elon is very successful at raising capitol every time the company is about to go bankrupt. With those two ideas in mind, play this as the day trade it is, and don't get so emotional about it. Tesla isn't going to save the world, nor does Elon eat babies even if he is kind of a toad. Make the money while you can and be ready to jump because the market is going to take a massive dump sooner or later, history proves this. I would say this about any hype stock including FB, APPL, ABC (well maybe not, they do basically own the internet.) Amazon, Netflix, or even things like GM, F and a few others.",
"Thank you for this well-written article. The Tesla Short Industrial Complex controls most of the articles about Tesla on this site. They even deny that continued share price support is important.

Ever since the third quarter report, TSLA has outperformed most tech stocks and major indices. What's in your wallet?",

Plus, there is that California law mandating solar home power. Other states (not to mention countries) will follow, as they always do. If you're having a solar roof built in from inception of the house, there's nothing to match Tesla's for looks or guarantee.There will be competition, there will be bumps, and there will be mistakes. But the buggy industry could do nothing to stop the advance of automobiles, nor could railroad stop the air industry, or the post office stop email. When the future arrives, it's often with a vengeance.",
@fydo So agree with you. Markets are closing. All the companies which rely on capital markets to operate will die. Free money is over.,
"I fail to see how Tesla makes it through Q1. US demand is tapped out and the Model 3 is not yet homologated in the EU. Add in a trade war and there are insufficient revenue streams left to even pay off Accounts Payable, let alone service other debts and existing customers that have bumpers falling off...",

Especially since the release of their last quarter results.However, I think you overreach by saying, in regards to Solvency:""Ford and GM vastly underperform Tesla""This is simply not true:-Tesla has significantly less cash on hand-Ford and GM are growing cash significantly faster (last quarter was $3B for GM, $1.7B for F, and $.7B for TSLA). There's no reason to think TSLA will add more than $1B in cash in any quarter in the foreseeable future, even if everything goes right. Even if they did add that much cash, it would take them about 18 quarters to catch up to GM and Ford.I think your good article is diminished by this blatant untruth.",

The longest Bull Market in U.S. history has not yet lifted TSLA out of it eternal LOSS years..and TSLA's longtime high quote was more than 1 1/2 yrs ago.  Tesla actual production models are in the fading ""sedan"" range..and limited to luxury buyers even yet.  The CEO is still one who knows little about automotive production (even though his drug trips seem to have subsided).  Other hi-end automotive companies are about to produce glamorous EV designs equal to or out-doing the touted Tesla ""Wow"".   Last, but hardly least, the days of nearly free loans are just about over, with invester yields appearing...leaving Tesla is its most horrific debt yet.      A Bear will quite soon convert Tesla high-hopes to ashes.  Only consistently profitable companies can survive a prolonged downturn..and it is probably upon us in 2019.",
Higher interest rates/ leveling off in sales/tariff instability/ late bull market with countless signs of recession+ stupid high valuation= stock price collapse with huge huge debt/ probable bankruptcy. Oh.... and production is building up a huge inventory glut....so yeah the bear case is done....not.Tesla will be $600/700 no $1000 this time next year.... BS Good luck generating “profits”!,

The world is slowly moving toward EV's due to climate change.  But EV's still make up for a tiny fraction of autos sold today which is why Tesla stands alone.""Tesla's solvency is improving with every quarter that goes by as long as the company delivers profits and cash flows.""There you go.  With a huge debt payment due in March, demand softening now that backlog is filled, tax rebates are decreasing, margins on the mid range Model 3 decreasing.....  how are they going to deliver profits and cash flows??

"Most glaring error here is your comment that “only a small sliver of operating income” was from the sale of credits. In fact it was 74%. In addition, the company continued its obfuscation by not mentioning that fact in the earnings release. Those sales are by definition unsustainable and unrepeatable. The rest of the Q3 “profit” was due to under-reserving for warranty cost. Watch the growth story unravel as Q4 revenue is only slightly higher than Q1, with profit down if not negative. In Q1, US sales of model 3 decline with expiration of FIT and adverse mix shift. Euro orders may help, but remember that there is a delay in deliveries due to shipping, which will glaringly manifest in negative working capital.

BMW charges less for brakes than Tesla does except you can bring your BMW to any mechanic and have it done for even less.  VW announced 2026 is final year its releasing new ICE platforms, all EV after that.  VW consistently sells 9+ mil vehicles a year, Tesla has yet to prove there’s demand beyond the initial cult nerds.",
"Great article top to bottom.  The smarter shorts have already covered.  See Paulo Santos article immediately after Q3 results.The only thing I would add to your list is that real competition, when it finally arrives in the early 2020s, will very likely help Tesla, as it'll push EVs out of a growing niche and into the mainstream.  EVs present a very dangerous dilemma for Big Auto.  More massive restructuring (ala GM/Ford) is to come and some clearly won't survive.Here's my prediction for Chanos:  he'll quietly cover in the next few months.  If not after Q4 results, then after Q1.  He'll reveal it in a CNBC or other interview and use some self-saving excuse about a cult stock that defies logic and that it wasn't worth his time.",
"At this point, the main driver behind bullishness is the stock price itself.  The Company is near financial failure as the CEO himself recently admitted.  The Company still is, despite the picture EM has been trying to paint lately.  A crowded short play is not a fun place to place money, but the volatility it creates doesn't mean the short case is wrong, it just means it's easier to shake out weak hands.  Ackman knows the problems with very public short bets, they're easily attacked.The broad market cracking, which it now appears to be rolling over, will expose many of the issues Tesla has been hiding behind a bull market.",
"I don't think anyone can realistically have a confident long or short thesis in Tesla right now.

"The main short thesis is the valuation, and the author failed miserably in disarming that argument. Talking about P/S ratios of 10 times of most everything else is completely meaningless when all that comes out of years of trying is losses, losses, more losses. A quarter here and there of small positive profits are always possible, but over time completely drown in red ink.Without long term sustainable profits there is no value. Period.The short thesis is alive and well.",
"I went to a local Tesla dealership /SC and could not get into their parking lot due to the number of cars awaiting transfer to new owners.

"Here is what is happening:Longs think they are smarter than they are.  Pile in with very large amounts of their portfolio at high levels.  Stock does what it always does, and sentiment shifts.  Longs disappear from this forum and wish they had ""dry powder' to help average out their losses.  I don't know what is going to happen next.  My open short position sucks.  If I said otherwise it would be like 99.9% of people who post on the internet..a lie.  But the one thing I am consistent with is a) not my only shorted stock b) most of my net worth has been in cash since august., c) manage position sizes.  No one times these things perfectly.  Not me.  Not you.  Not the Bond King.  I personally don't see why the fundamental short thesis is any different than it was at 250.  Short term though, the price action does seem to be holding up and I have no idea why, nor how long it might last.  3 breakouts at 360, none lasted long.  All finished <1% of convert price.  hmmm!",
One quarter of profits that were manufactured through one time accounting gimmicks and the bear thesis is dead??  Show me one year of profits and then we can look at the small problem of current valuation to sales.  Growth needs a new product and Tesla is out of ammo for next 2-3 years.,
Tesla is a highly manipulated stock. For a year and a half now we see the same story. A sudden avalanche of bullishness pushing the stock near 400 then a backlash in the opposite direction pushing it down again. Each low seems to be getting lower. This is a day trader short term profit mechanism. There are so many forces trying to manipulate the stock for profit both positive and negative. Many bears will become brief bulls pumping the stock for short term gain and visa versa for bulls. History has proven that highly manipulated stocks always have a bad ending for true long term investors.,
"Lag times from order to delivery have shortened tremendously, destroying the ""can't keep up with demand"" thesis. If you check Reddit or Twitter, you'll find plenty of stories from real customers (not shorts spreading FUD) of woeful range performance in colder climes, as well as things like windows/door handles freezing (since TSLA pretty much opted to skip beta testing the M3), and outright horrible customer service (long phone wait times, unreturned calls/emails, foot dragging on refunds). YOY sales in Europe are showing the effects of the entrance of Audi/Jag. The tax credit's getting cut in half in a few weeks. And, oh yeah, the DOJ isn't done yet. And none of these things take into account the continued drag of the non-arm's length bailout of SCTY.Taken together, this is a perfect storm that is due to hit the fan Q1/Q2 next year. Elon himself said they were single-digit weeks away from buying the farm just before that miraculous Q3. If you think this is bullish, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.",

"Nonsense.  The auto industry is a terrible one for investments.  TSLA is at best marginally profitable.  It valuation is absurd.  The only reason for the absurd valuation is that so called investors in the stock believe that Elon Musk will revolutionize the world going far beyond automobiles.  But there is no evidence for that.  In fact he has a long history of exaggeration, make believe and not delivering on real promises.",

"I believe the short thesis for Tesla is stronger than ever. The stock price has been stuck in a channel for over a year now that swings between $250 and $380. The stock pumps are getting crazier and crazier with the lastest one of Tesla being able to go from dirt to a factory producing cars in a year. and the realization that even with selling 80,000 cars a quater it only make a profit thanks to tax subsidies and not paying its bills. Tesla is not going to be able to continue selling 80,000 cars a quarter especially when the market is tapped out followed by tax rebates over the next year will go from 7500 to zero. Europe is not going to be Tesla savior. we already seeing model S and X sales numbers decline by double digits in most countries there  followed by a car that cost twice as much as promised not making too many people in EU happy.Granted Tesla might have a great 4th quarter which might be even better than 3rd quarter but it will be followed by a down turn that will make people finally realize that Tesla is a niche company whose stock price is 10-11 times higher than it should be. Let's see if analysts finally wake up or continue to pump Tesla stock.",
"I would agree about everything except point number 2 and partially 4.  They're far, far away from being the best on autonomous driving.My tesla thinks its hitting things in a heavy snowstorm while missing the cars around it, and keeps trying to make me stop because it thinks its going to hit my garage wall while backing out.  It is not driving itself anywhere in any sort of actually adverse conditions any time soon.Moreover, the idea that they're going to be better at chips than NVIDIA and Intel and better at machine learning than Google is hilarious.I'm also somewhat skeptical on the valuation, but valuation based shorts are dangerous anyway, and that one is more arguable.",
"Agree, not persuasive. General aspects of the bear case seem unchanged, to me, and will likely harden over time absent substantive new news. IMHO",
"Is ""the short thesis"" in writing somewhere, like the Gettysburg Address or Kubla Khan?",
Short thesis is NOT dying. It is already dead.Don’t tell that to the “7 in September” or “negative working capital” folks however. They might as well continue to learn a hard lesson by selling short. It is really the only way to learn a lesson well- right in the pocket book.,
Ssshhh!  Don't tell that to the Tesla-hating echo chamber.  We want them to keep writing articles on how Elon is still going to jail and how Tesla can neither be profitable or sustainable long-term.  You're gonna ruin the short-squeeze party!,

"Who can we trust these days?  Seriously this is ridiculous as an investor to get zero response from the company.  If the share price ever hits my cost basis I'm done with this company unless there are major leadership changes, and I'm not talking a reshuffling.  Why am I still holding shares you may ask?  Because I refuse to give in and sell to these people and give them what they want.  I invested in the company on good faith that they would be good stewards of the money I gave them to use and apparently they either f'd up or deliberately cheated us.  This won't fly in the USA.  I'm more pissed about this than my losses that are 500 times larger because those were errors on my part by not selling or buying at the correct time, or holding onto shares into a steep decline (ie: NVDA & APPL.. need I say more?)  I'm out a heck of a lot more on those but they will come back.  APHA? Who really knows?  It seems that Vic and cast don't care to address shareholder concerns whatsoever.  Could they at least say something?  Like give us an updated approximate date of the report since Vic missed this past Wednesday?

This would massacre this stock again MGTI style.Have you guys brought your accusation forward to SEC + DOJ?So that is the risk here.Even if they have evaded a related party transaction (which they haven't filed) by splitting hairs,an extreme overvalue asset transaction would also be on the table with ALL parties involved.I found IKN's post yesterday quite interesting, the 'very experienced person' admitted all thosefairness valuations and valuations in general are BS b/c nobody does real actual DD from sell side, not even to speak about on site visits.A little slap on your guys wrists is that you didn't properly disclosed the source of that missing office at #51 was it I guess. +++BTW what I found most irritating of APHA is that they sort of admitted a very critical legal situation today by using their 'independent' BOD and audit team to analyze the valuation etc.This means APHA couldn't outright come forward and give details to support the purchase price - legally speaking.APHA also was incapable to make a statement on the related party transaction.Almost an capitulation.Note that one independent BOD _and_ Leader of the Audit-Team has left on 9/14,Denis Staudt. This was right before the deal closed on 9/27!Where have I seen a similar thing lately? HMNY ;-)",
I’m surprised how many excuse makers there are here for Vic. I bought the stock but I’ve stated multiple times I never trusted Vic. The Nuuvera deal was smelly and everyone knows it. There’s enough information presented here to warrant a high degree of suspicion and hopefully investigation bringing criminal charges. Does that mean Aphria is worthless? No but it does mean the management and BOD need to go ASAP. Is sounds like the fleecing represents significant value. Just imagine those hundreds of millions in the cash coffer to grow the core business instead of crooks pockets. Whenever your kids and wives are used as straw men you can bet the deal is shady.,

Also, maybe their international assets aren't up to par, but their Canadian assets? Seem in order to me and they will report earnings soon. I have no position in Aphria.",
"These scenarios have played out for as long as there have been markets and market participants to be had.

Corruption most always wins or, more appropriately, loses the day for shareholders. Like the long arm of the law, sometimes it just takes a while with some ups and downs along the way.",

"Just watched the interview on BNN with Brady Cobb, the CEO of SOL/Sythian. He points out a few problems with the Hindenburg report, but they were relatively minor issues (a couple of facilities in Jamaica that Hindenburg missed but are not worth much anyway and a few other issues needing clarification), and he avoided addressing the main problem that Aphria had bought companies for hundreds of millions of dollars through Sythian and those companies had assets that only a few weeks or days prior to the purchases had little value; and that the manner in which those assets were originally acquired and transferred between related companies looked like it was meant to disguise the fact the assets had little value as well as shelter the parties involved, who were obviously related, from rules governing insider trading. It didn't help that the interviewer did a poor job of addressing that issue and challenging Cobb. Cobb did re-iterate that no insider trading rules were broken but that remains to be seen. The downfall for Aphria and probably SOL and their directors will come from their failure to perform their fiduciary duties. They approved large payments to related parties for assets that had little value. Regardless of what Clarus, Cormark or any other paid crony has said, assets that had nominal value one day cannot be worth hundreds of millions a few days later without any substantial value added.",

what they have done is equivalent to inside buying as they short the stock with plans to issue negative news hence dropping the stock price causing fear. liberty is in a great position as their seals and customer base has been multiplying at a rapid pace. he says they are not short liberty however the achrona friends probably are however liberty will not stay down. there's nothing wrong with shorting a stock however doing so in the fashion with releasing negative news afterwards will have devastating consequences,

"Your argument: Value created by Friends for NFLX is > $100m per year. Okay, perhaps. We don't know, because as you said, only NFLX management knows and they aren't going to give us that valuable information. If we do accept that the acquisition of Friends content is value creating in the short-term, we still have to accept the price jumped from $30m to $100m for the content. That can only be viewed as a symptom of rising competition that has not been demonstrated so visibly in the past. NFLX management would not pay more for existing content just because they know it is worth more. Paying more for Friends also does not encourage T to produce more high quality content for NFLX (in fact, it probably encourages T to find more arbitrage opportunities that will hurt NFLX). NFLX is paying more because it has to. For a stock that is imaginatively valued like NFLX, the realization of business model threats has to be considered negative. This is a big threat to costs and there are significant competitive threats to revenue that investors should be thinking about. This event cannot be viewed positively except in the sense that losing Friends may have been worse for NFLX in the short-term than paying a huge amount more for it.",
"T still owns Friends, so can always get exclusive distribution in the relatively near future, but making big bucks until then is genius, especially since because Netflix has bigger distribution now, the demand for Friends will likely increase, such that it will have a bigger value to T, to either sell, sell distribution rights or make T’s streaming app more valuable.",

The company has clearly forgotten what the loss of 800K subscribers did to its stock in 2011. Imagine if everyone upset at the cancellation  of Daredevil decided to cancel their Netflix subscription, even if just for a quarter. That's about 5 million people.",
"Kevin-appreciate the effort but you appear to let confirmation bias your analysis.  This license fee increase of 230% is an expense at a time when Netflix is attempting to create enough original content to offset the content they are poised to lose in the future. The legacy model that contributed to the dominant position NFLX created was short sighted and opportunistic.  Content providers were years too late in recognizing the import of DTC distribution.  They focused on cable and satellite and figured licensing the same content to NFLX was additive.  Those days are quickly coming to an end.  Now these same content owners are either pulling content or increasing fees to help fund their ability to generate their own DTC offerings.A large majority of the viewing hours by NFLX customers are licensed content.  In the past 12 months NFLX has invested heavily in original content but has only reduced their licensed  content asset mix from 82% to 73%.  Pretty impressive but consider the cost.  NFLX Debt/Equity ratio over doubled from 0.46x in Cye14 to 1.03x at CYE17.  It is now 1.05x at 3Q18.  The average int rate is around 5% on their $8b+ in LTD so despite having extremely low cost debt for the past few years, they were not able to achieve anywhere close to market rates.Content costs are increasing as they invest in original content.  The B/S content cost divided by subscribers has been steadily increasing.  It was $102 per sub at CYE15 and is now up to $141 per sub.  The trends are clear. They have had to increase leverage to reduce reliance on licensed content and their debt burden and carrying costs have gone up as a result.  Toward the end of C19 they will lose another slug of content from Disney properties and the reduced licensed cost will be far smaller than the cost of creating content to replace it.  I don't mean to indicate that NFLX will lose their DTC control.  They will likely maintain a leadership position for years.  However as more and more competitors enter the fray and show traction in subscribers, investors will no longer attribute the valuation premium they have enjoyed.  Not sure when but the more price increases on licensed content that they are forced to pay, the faster this realization will occur.For a lot more data see my article seekingalpha.com/...",

"I wouldn't watch Netflix original content if they paid me.If Netflix has to pony up 100 million for a sitcom that's been off the air for 20 years, then we can all safely assume that GoT would bankrupt them",
I believe it was a non-exclusive deal where T will still have rights for their own streaming service.  So they get the $$ and keep the content too.,
"AT&T is laughing all the way to the bank with this one. I bet AT&T did sit at their boardroom thinking what sick unbelievable price can we come up with. And one of them said, lets say 100million for 1 year. And everyone was like whaaat? They are not dumb enough to do that deal. Three hours later they are laughing all the way to the bank. As you said ""content is king"" but it is not about just making the most content. It is about making quality content. I have a maximum of about 2 hours a day I can spend watching a series or movie. I do not want to spend that time watching something worthless. I love the Star-Wars franchise, I love Game of Thrones, last week tonight with john oliver and I very much enjoy Marvel. So I will not sit and watch orange is the new black, because I subscribe to Netflix. No I will spend 1 minute cancel Netflix, one minute subscribing for HBO and one minute subscribing for Disney/Hulu. And two minutes later I will use 157 minutes watching the shows I love and that gives me the most value for my money. My time is to valuable to watch bad content. This is not the age of TV-channels where you had to watch what is on. No in this time and age, we watch what we want, when we want. :-)",
"AT&T already announced their rival service wont be available broadly until 2020. They are making money licensing their most valuable piece up IP for one year because they don't have any use for it. They will have it back when they are ready to launch. Boom, there is your answer. You are reading too much into nothing.",
I like your article. I was more bearish on Netflix a couple months ago but I am slowly changing my opinion (or not). Long Disney for disclosure. What is becoming painfully evident to me is consumers are only going to fork over for streaming services they see as must watch and steal the rest online. Wages aren't up too much people have a finite wallet and will make hard choices when it comes to streaming. With the coming fragmentation of the streaming market I would say Netflix has a clear lead now and that people have paid their Netflix for years now seeing it as requirement and treasure trove of content. As Netflix continue to have content pulled they will find themselves in a relatively weaker position in content but likely still overall strength over competition in a highly fragmented market. Because anybody that isn't Netflix or Disney is going to find themselves in a line of questioning (especially if a person is paying separately for cable initially) of why is this company trying to scam me and double charge? I know I would not even consider an individual network streaming service because no one network has enough to justify me paying them anything. I am not willing to take the plunge on Netflix but I am warming up to the idea. I just know it's going to be a crazy and bumpy ride and I am very interested as a consumer to see where this all leads. I think Netflix content over the years will take on a u shape graph in volume over time. Step 1 lead. Step two battle fragmented market. Step 3 possibly emerge as a leader and gradually get back content from failed streamers. I am on lunch and this is basically my inner head rambling so I hope it makes sense.,
"The idea that new Netflix content will ever command $100M a year to license is speculative at best. Friends for $100M a year is more about holding off the deep pockets of Amazon, Wal-Mart and the upstart streamers - and holding then off for exactly 365 days. It's a lot of money for a very temporary moat....","Why The 'Friends' Deal Is A Win For Netflix, Not AT&T"

Great article. Winmark allocates capital as well as any company—textbook. I think one should consider the role of dividends for this stock. Debt funded tenders will become more difficult and will only exacerbate the poor liquidity in the stock. At current rates the dividend will be close to $4.00 in ten years. More likely is that it will grow more than 20% per year and will include one time large dividends.  More likely is an $8.00 dividend in ten years. Sounds crazy but not impossible.

"I can sum up exactly why banks are not doing well....Wells Fargo - pinched for opening fraudulent accounts.  I worked for Wells Fargo as a HMC (home mortgage consultant).  They pressed for numbers every single day - hard.  In the banker section, they pressed for new accounts every day.  WF numbers only looked good for so long because they were tricking the system and acting fraudulently.  Now that they aren't cheating customers they are not making money.  Consider this the new normal.  Banks won't be profitable to the extent they were before.  As for the mortgage portion of the bank (specifically WF but applies to others) - the internet started bleeding away applications over a decade ago and its more and more prevalent every single day.  So, banks don't have the same mortgage income they once commanded.  All that aside, I think PYPL is a great investment.  Banks - not so much.",

I have no visibility about VEEV future revenue shortfall, it may come but honestly do not know.",
You mean in 20 years.  Veev is 20x sales. And growth rate has already slowed from high double digit to a pedestrian 20%,
"Why is 10x P/S so interesting…well it reminds me of one of my favorite quotations on the insanity of valuations. This one comes from Scott McNealy, the then CEO of Sun Microsystems:“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You donʼt need any transparency. You donʼt need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”Veev is 20x sales",

Whenever I would ask people in pharma marketing about it, they had no idea who Veeva was. That was not the case in clinical trials when asking about MDSO.",

Sorry to say I am quite naive on the subject but it seems to me iqvia is mainly for the commercial help and veev is more on the lab/development regs or am i wrong on this,
Thanks.  Useful data for follow-up research.  You earned a Follow.,
"I would like to counter few points here.  First the guidance is conservative, in the past 17 quarters VEEV always beat guidance and even estimate by a large amount. 17% growth would be quite negative on the other hand as the market is looking for 23-25%. If the growth is just 17% the price is quite expensive at 90. Another point to make  is that  VEEV does not need to gain market share to grow, as long as the existing clients are spending more every year.Finally the third point is about the superior margins compared to other names mentioned. Additionally the management showed good skill in execution.  These things make me reluctant to see the stock as a sell, I just took some profit and maintain a small position. There is a strong support around the $80 level, if a big market crash will pull the stock below around 55 -60 I may consider buying more or selling some puts. In the end I see the stock es neutral right now, but the overall market is quite dangerous. I agree with the positive view on other names like NTNX and TWLO which are more interesting than VEEV right now.",

This reflects an increase from our previous guidance of $281 million to $284 million and a margin of almost 34%.

"Hello All, It is very important that folks read the Sunniva Prospectus slowly. You can locate it on sedar.com and search the company files. This is the best place to get true / accurate data on the company despite what is ever written about them by third parties such as authors on Seeking Alpha and other 3rd party websites..Just to give you some perspective: Canopy Growth (CGC) does:73 million in sales revenue but has a 11 BILLION market capSunniva (CSE: SNN OTCQB: SNNVF) does:15.1 million in sales revenue but has a 93 MILLION market capJust by looking at these simple statistics you can see how undervalued Sunniva is... but again as Cornerstone says.. Sunniva needs to prove themselves to the market. Sunniva isn't even selling product yet while CGC has been for quite some time and the sales to market cap ratio is very attractive. A lone Seeking Alpha contributor Ted Oashi called them the potential Canopy of California and he may be right..... but again only if... Sunniva can deliver... as Cornerstone continues to write.The question is can they deliver? take a look for yourself.... in the link on their website.www.sunniva.com/...",

Look at what happened with the Hindenburg hit piece on Aphria and Liberty.   Even if that turns out to be true, which will be only partial in my opinion, it is only one or two companies involved.

"Some misinformation in this article.  For now, I'll just challenge a small part of it.  You do know that the contractor is hired by the owner who will be renting the building to Sunniva upon completion?  To think the owner of the building isn't interested in starting his rent income by cutting back on the workers is, well, anti capitalistic thinking.  The lights were on at 5am today and work inside the 2 bays close to completion is hustling along with seedling plants ready to be imported as soon as possible (early 1st Q)Furthermore, deadlines were missed due to vendor shortages and late equipment deliveries.  Besides, this is a state of art, cGMP facility, 8 football fields long and if you have been involved in any type of complicated construction project, it shouldn't be difficult to understand delays.  Additionally, as I stated in the beginning it is not Sunniva in charge of construction, (they will be the inhabitants), so delays are on the build to suit owner, not Sunniva as implied here.Point is the delays will still leave them first to market with a the largest cGMP rated faclity, in the largest MJ market in the legalized world today.  Go to Sunniva's website and take a look at the photos of this marvelous, current GMP qualified, pharmaceutical quality capable, MJ facility. Dear Cornerstone, Please dig up another Aphria for us, instead of leading us away from this potential laden company.Thanks,mPS based upon conversation with a fellow investor who spoke with management, they estimate sufficient funding to last through 1st-2nd quarter and by then expect revenues from product sales to handle the load. And although the MJ investor has been inured to dilution, that's not Sunniva's go to strategy, at least not until after the spin out and then only if needed.",

"@Salty Peter - Michael Barker is the founder of the Barker group and is on the board of directors and also has shares in the company.

Wouldn't the total amount paid for 2019 be pro-rated based on the facility completion date/inspections?

Author:How does what you say square with another article that says INTC is essentially finished because of ARM chips taking over the market?@gandc,
Bought a starter position today at $46.33,
What a wild ride  on Wall Street  getting expensive to buy puts,
"""Market Sell-Off - Vindication""  INTC only dropped from ~$47 down to ~$44 in October when AMD and NVDA were dropping over 40% during the month.  If You look from June of 2018 INTC dropped from ~$57 to ~$48 while AMD and NVDA were setting new highs that were described as parabolic.  Go back to 2015 and INTC has risen from $28 to ~$48 while NVDA has gone from ~$25 to ~$160 and AMD has gone from ~$3 to ~$21.  Guessing that ""Market Sell-Off - Vindication"" depends on time frame you want to look at.  Personally I believe that the tech sector sell off over the last 2 months shows that NVDA and AMD are the stronger stocks to invest in!""A Different Story - Diversified Growth"" NVDA went up 58% YoY in datacenter.  If INTC went up a comparable percentage, why not use the INTC numbers rather than trying to justify a position on another companies numbers?   NVDA supposedly sells 3 times to 4 times as many GPU to data center as INTC sells GPU.  Perhaps @Michael Wiggins De Oliveira  could instead state how much the TAM of datacenter went up YoY, then deduct the value of a 58% increase in NVDA datacenter increase from the TAM number increase which would give you the amount of total available (if any) YoY TAM growth was available for all other companies in the expanding market.  If this number is negative that would indicate that NVDA was actually taking sales away from INTC on the established TAM.  If the number is positive then you can use that positive number to estimate INTC YoY TAM increase if you disregard all other competitors in the space such as AMD which sells both CPU and GPU.  For a numbers guy the author doesn't seem to like to do the math!""Share Repurchases?  It is great that INTC is spending $15 Billion on share repurchase.  Are the repurchased shares being retired or are they being placed back in treasury for future uses such as a cash raise?  INTC only pays a ~2.6% dividend.  INTC has not increased the $0.30 ($1.20 yearly) dividend in 4 quarters.  Instead of a share repurchase INTC should be raising the dividend.  One of the major tenents that was drilled into me as an investor is that the safest dividend is the one that has just been raised because it indicates that the company BOD believe that the company future is positive for at least the next 2 quarters.  INTC should have had a dividend raise rather than a stock buy back.  How much of the stock buy back is being returned to management in the form of stock grants?  If you are going to discuss something like a stock buy back you need to discuss it from all angles not just cherry pick the parts you like to justify your position.""Valuation""  INTC has massive expenses along with massive cash.  So many analysts like to say that INTC spends $15.5 Billion on R&D compared to AMD paltry $1.5 Billion.  What they ignore is that INTC has been dumping that huge amount of R&D money into a black hole called EUV 10 nm wafer production (which is over 3 years behind schedule) and still not a viable process.  INTC used to have the biggest best and most fab of any company.  Today the valuation of the best fab has transitioned to TSMC,  INTC is going to need that massive cash horde to continue to try and make their monolith architecture work at EUV 10 nm production which may still be susceptible to side looking hacks!  BTW how are INTC margins doing the last few quarters?  Raising margins indicate a company that is increasing TAM so why not tell readers the Gross margin numbers.Disclaimer long AMD, short INTC and no position in NVDA",

Or one can be content with a sector fund's basket of defensive play stocks with one purchase.I actually start to trim down my utilities lock in gains from XLU plus SO and D (two individual sector stocks in addition to the sector fund I own) to gradually get back in XLE and BP, XOM, SLB/HAL, DVN and yes the best play stock RIG due to its high Beta value.

Bad move any company owned by 3G is destined to fail - they have no idea how to run a food company and continue to struggle ever since they took over unless they change management there is little hope,
"My valuation of KHC shares is currently about $50, so $49 is not a great bargain.  I also don't think that buying a fully valued stock that is falling so strongly and quickly and is currently at a multi year low is a great idea.I usually give a stock that is not extremely underpriced, by my calculations, at least 6 months from its most recent low to build a base of support.  I only buy falling knives that I believe are at least 30% undervalued, which in my opinion KHC is not.I sold my position around $72 a share just after the Kraft Heinz merger, believing the combined business to be worth around $45.  Today I believe it to be worth 10% more, which is about where it is trading.  Many consumer products companies are selling off now partially due to tax loss harvesting.  Due to this one reason, I think that there is little reason to jump in before later in the year even if you think these shares are already cheap enough.

"After being in the buy crowd earlier this year (after Cambridge Analytica scandal), I am in the neutral crowd after the infamous July 25th investor teleconference. The biggest reason is because of the reduced profitability FB will see in the next year or two. FB has stated that their guidance for operating margins will slowly come down from ~48% today to 35-37% next year. This will further reduce profit margins and FCF margins. The increased amount of content security they must hire will lower incremental profit margins from additional revenue they make and it is yet to see the full impact of this. Also on a FCF basis, FB is currently trading between 24-26x FCF, depending on how you treat stock based compensation (~4B TTM). This is due to the huge increase in CAPEX spending which is on data/networking equipment. All in all, increased content security hiring and additional capex spending is reducing shareholder returns even after stock repurchases. If FB can do ~100B in revenues in 5 years, their FCF numbers may be in the 25B range. With that, it seems like FB is almost fairly priced right now. The upside for FB will be if they can stabilize the security of their platform (increasing incremental margins on revenue), regain trust with the public, increasing pricing power for other platforms, and pivot to video advertising as Zuckerberg wants to. This seems like a lot of things FB has to get right in order to be a buy at this price.",

FB is down because of a disconnect between investor sentiment and advertiser sentiment.

I seriously can’t name anyone around where I live who use Facebook the way they used too. Some of them don’t use it anymore and others who do are just scrolling because they are bored and annoyed of the advertising.

"Nevin, I agree completely with the thinking that as consumers begin to realize 5G could alter the makeup of phones in the relatively near-term - debatable how much in that period, some will hold onto their existing devices for an additional two years from today. Consumer's motivation to buy new devices is often driven as much by other's perception of owner as the perceived need - think expensive handbags - and one might be considered not in the loop if buying a 4G phone with 5G on the brink of availability. Something happening today in the sedan vs. crossover/SUV market with sedans going down precipitately. That will put pressure on everyone in the food chain. Low cost phones in developing countries might make up some of the volume but the phone and component values are lower therefore only partially offsetting the potential $'s lost.",
"Mikesanna, excellent summary.  Much thanks.   I've been invested in this space since the mid-1990s beginning with Anadigics, then RFMD, Sawtek and eventually SWKS and QRVO (thru the RFMD/TriQuint merger).   Once upon a time, the market recognized the potential in handset components.  Handsets themselves had a horrible record for making profits because of the pace of innovation and competition.   Component makers on the other hand could make good money as unit volumes were/are high (handset sales are over 1.5 billion units in 2017) and product cycles are short.   Product cycles last about a year these days and most people replace their phones every 18 mos to 3 years.   The life of a device is lengthening but still gets tossed at a max of the 3 year mark.   Compared to PCs, and other tech items, this is probably the highest unit volume for sales and the shortest product cycle you can find.   The pace of innovation has slowed for handsets there is no doubt about that but 5G will change that.   For the next year before 5G handsets roll out we will see something of a pause in unit sale growth.   Personally, I think that the adoption of 5G will allow innovation in handset designs to accelerate once again as bandwidth and speed allow for more uses and features.   Part of the reason for the slowing growth rate for handset sales is the lack of new features or must-have capabilities.   Medical diagnostics could be the next big frontier in this regard.   In any event, good luck to all.   It's only a matter of time before SWKS and QRVO get moving again.",
"From my perspective (a scientist with 35 years experience in the semiconductor industry), SWKS is not a mini TXN; not even close. First and foremost, TXN has a much longer history of delivering a DGR > 20%, and that makes it all but a must have stock in a DGR portfolio. Also, SWKS has a significantly larger exposure to AAPL as a customer. Additionally, TXN is far more diversified with 100,000 customers and a similar count of products. SWKS is more of a III-V device play than TXN, and therein lies a key difference in product offerings. In the analog sector, all companies have their relative strengths and weaknesses and IMHO, TXN offers the best combination of stability, diversification, earnings growth, and DGR. Very long TXN.",

i love this stock. but it is unloved by the market. it trades in stride with apple - so others have argued - why not just own apple? its a good argument.,
SU nice piece.  I see SWKS as a great potential company with a strong AAPL relationship.   I purchased some in the recent pullback.  I think 5G is a great opportunity.  I was impressed with their CEO who knew a couple of years ago he had too many eggs in the AAPLbasket.,
capex is 47% of their earning. do toi sée it decreasing over thé future? cause this impacts the returns.,
It seems QRVO is ahead of SWKS in most of the markets called out for future growth. One strength SWKS has that it shares with TXN is great cost and cash management. Neither invests too far ahead of the market and don't lose on big strategic moves often. The one SWKS exception was a big investment in phone controllers a while back. That focus on cash shows up in their relative performance over time and their balance sheets.,
"ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM: There is a chance that AAPL will soon discontinue to use SWKS, and either build one or more components in-house and/or go with an alternative company. AAPL has done this multiple times in the past for various reasons. Let's say there is only a 10% chance of this happening.(Can only guess) The effect this would have on share price would be devastating...let's say 50+% drop (since AAPL is 47% of revenue). While SWKS is a great company, with a the brightest of futures, the problem is the 10% chance of losing 50% of your invested capital.Disclaimer: I am long SWKS, but attribute known risk above as another factor in today's 'cheap' share price. Of course, as SWKS diversifies, the amount of this risk is reduced. Note: I used '10%' above, and don't really know what the odds are of this happening, but I do know it has happened in the past.",

"Great article. Skyworks is on my definite buy list, About 4 years ago I watched it go from about 30 a share to the 50's and was hoping for a pullback. Then I watched it go to over 100.  I just really want market capitulation (which looks like we might get in the next couple days with more headlines with the word SeLL in them.). What I like is the more than 5 dollars a share in cash on the books with no debt. You have a list of technologies Skyworks is involved in. Investors should zero in on the Gan listing you have. 5G cannot take place without it. IIVI and QVRO both supply Gan substrates and are reporting double digit sales growth. The problem is we are in the early innings of the 5G build out. AT&T said it could be at least a year before they are able to take advantage of 5G. I agree this is getting to be an awfully cheap stock for the potential growth.",

"From where I sit, it looks like we have a lot of dead people and a system which needs to change.  Finger-pointing is not going to help very much.The one thing that really needs to change, IMHO, is aircraft design philosophy.Specifically, ""OFF MEANS OFF"".There needs to be an obvious, easy-to-use control which turns off the auto-pilot,automatic trim control, automatic engine control, etc.  The situation which crashedthe Air Lion flight is not new:  Automated software does not usually recover well frombad or flaky sensor inputs.  This has been a problem with cars, where it is called""sudden acceleration syndrome"".  It is also a problem with airplanes.If we are going to have a pilot, then we need to have an Off Switch for that other stuff.",
"If I were running an airline company, and learned about this problem and it's current analysis, etc. I would require that an AOA sensor simulator test device be used to inject a signal thru the entire system to verify that all is well, at least on the ground.I would also field stress test every AOA sensor in my possession to determine if there are any failures of any kind whatsoever of the sensor itself.This won't cover all flight stress induced failures : vibration, shock, flexing, bending, stretching, torque pivot points, temperature, altitude, humidity, contamination, intermittents, etc. but it would be a good start.There is a lot of wiring and electronics in that aircraft, and any of it could have an intermittent or obscure problem occurring only during flight, and as this problem keeps recurring in flight that looks like that could be the case. It may never be found without extroadinary measures taken too lengthy to describe here.All other wise and recommended actions should also be followed, i.e. information, rigorous pilot training and all the rest. Then, if the aircraft can truly be flown successfully when the problem occurs, and it sounds like that it can with appropriate recovery actions,  then lives will be saved.All concerned must stay with this problem and not let go until it is solved.",
"Since the trim was in the half speed mode it may have been less obvious that it was ""running away"". That procedure saved the aircraft previously. My personal suspicion is that the horizontal stabilizer  is undersized for dealing with deep stalls on this model aircraft. Papering over this design fault with electric systems needs to stop somewhere short of MCAS.",
"1.  Pilots could not have engaged autopilot, but that is not relevant (autopilot will not engage with a pilot pushing on the controls).2.  Trim runaway recovery is something you generally train for, that is what simulators are for.3.   Trim runaway, in this instance, was caused by a failed sensor, but from a pilot’s perspective, the component failure , or the flight management software that failed to error-trap - that doesn’t matter.  All that matters is that a trim anomaly occurred and the recovery procedure that was taught in the simulator should have been immediately taken by the pilot flying.  The first step is to move two pedestal- mounted switches to “cutoff” for any trim problem.4.  From Boeing’s perspective, the pilot flying failed to follow procedures for a trim runaway - procedures long established and trained for in the simulator.5.  From an investor’s perspective, Boeing stock performance will be unaffected.  The airline that failed to properly train the pilot and also failed to maintain the AOA sensors is at fault.6.  From an engineering perspective,  trim runaway can occur for a hundred different reasons.  The trim cutout switches stop automatic trim motion for any reason, including failed angle of attack sensors.  But the pilot must move the cutout switches if the trim runs away, something he apparently did not accomplish.",
"I wonder if more complex documentation would be anyway considered. Then in that case the culprit would have be why documentation didn't emphasize that.Planes can be over time safer and safer. And they must be. But nothing is ""stupids"" proof. The human factor will always be there until we have a complete automatic IA-driven plane (which doesn't mean safest flight possible)",
"Looking at a video of a B737 cockpit while flying, when the autopilot trims the plane, you can hear quite a distinctive sound, plus the trim wheels moving very rapidly.  It would be hard to miss both of those two things is that was happening as often and as long as it did on flight JT610.Were those pilots so overtaken by the AOA error that neither of them could notice?There were four previous flight on that particular plane with similar problem and those pilots seemed to have turned off the auto trim and keep flying manually.  The actual flight that terminated in the fatal crash lasted about 13 minutes or so.  Not a pilot so no idea if that was too short a time for those two pilots to figure things out.",

"Boeing (or other high level activities) could require a Boeing Pilot Certification Program to qualify the right to pilot any given aircraft where these kind of issues could be resolved before they end up killing a lot of people.Of course this puts the onus on Boeing, and other builders, to do a very thorough job in adequately familiarizing the pilots with all essential parts of their flight system, and the particular airline could (and probably should) go beyond that as an option.The flight system in operation should ""almost"" make (and always steer) the pilot to do the most appropriate and safest thing in any situation that engenders fear and confusion , and don't underestimate confusion because it can be and often is deadly.",
"I agree with the idea that a chain of failures caused the crash.Today, it looks like the chain went like this:1. The stall sensor failed.2. The airline negligently decided to not fix the sensor.3. Boeing's software failed to detect the failed sensor.4. The autopilot repeatedly tried to put the nose down.5. The aircraft user interface did not provide a clean way to turn off the autopilot.6. The autopilot was able to fly the aircraft into the water.In a legal sense, it would appear that many parties are to blame for what happened.It looks like a case of ""Joint and Several Liability"".Boeing appears to hold a major share of the blame, but not 100%.",
"The bit about not ""flooding"" the aircrew with information seems quite suspicious to me.  I'm not an airline pilot, but I would assume that any safety oriented pilot would want to be thoroughly trained in all the important details of the new system.  Boeing bet the lives of the passengers on the stall-warning system.  It failed and the passengers lost.   Lion Air should have demanded the most up-to-date training for their pilots.  Sounds like both Lion Air and Boeing cut corners in the run-up to this tragedy.",
Thank You Dhierin Bechai for the Article in detail! JD,
"Great article Dhierin, well balanced.While waiting for the conclusions of the investgation board of Lion Air crash it is normal for aircrew to make their own evaluation. An accident is the result of a chain of events and correctly has been mentioned that many possible opportunities have been missed to avoid this crash. The root cause might be Boeings desire to exclude a crash due to inadvertent handling of a blocked pitot or static opening. That wrong handling of this event by the aircrew can result in stall, resulting in fatal crashes, like the Boeing 727, Northwest Airlines Flight 6231 or Airbus 330 AF447. Indeed, if the Boeing 737MAX modification worked as designed , it would have prevented a very rare crash like these. And the AOA is normally a very reliable instrument. I never have seen a failing one in my career. However, reports mention that the system used only one Angle of Attack (AOA) as input. The output is then  a full nose down elevator deflection, that clearly could not be handled by the pilots. If the output is the result of a faulty AOA input and is further not checked against other readily available data, a crash can be the result as was proved so tragically. It is most likely very easy to program filters to cope with the info of one faulty AOA, like using both AOA’s, check it against IAS (indicated airspeed), attitude or data from the navigation system. If these additional data are in a normal brackets there is no reason to unleash 3000 PSI on the stick. You just loose,  if you are not a bodybuilder or could not make the brilliant evaluation that a system, that you do not know it is there, fails and that you should flip a few switches to cope with it. It is clearly a fundamental design failure by Boeing followed by an essential communication failure in the flight manual. Hopefully it’s is the only one and it might already have been fixed by reprogramming the software. The  MAX brand unfortunately is  now tainted (for a short while) and only initially there will be travelers who try to avoid the MAX. Most likely the present dip is buying opportunity as Boeing will certainly solve it by shoveling the blame on the aircrew, and Lion Air. Boeing lawyers are top!",

"One reason to own ( which I don't because of it's size ) is the possibility of a buyout by a larger storage concern. I don't think I saw that mentioned, and it was, I apologize.",
"Here's an idea that SELF management could implement immediately to close the discount gap:  SELF has $1.55M in marketable equity securities on the balance sheet. In Q3, SELF reported a loss of $180,021 on those same securities. The amount of that loss could have purchased ~45K shares of stock. If SELF is indeed trading at a 30% discount to liquidation value, AND if management has conviction that its strategy will substantially enhance shareholder value, then why not ask shareholders to authorize management to repurchase up to $1M in shares over the next four quarters. Granted, mgt wants to have dry powder to fund expansion and acquisitions. But, is there likely to be an expansion or acquisition that would have a better yield than closing a 30% discount in your share price? Given that SELF is losing money in the current market environment, why not place a bet on your SELF?",
"Right.  So that is precisely the point that I was attempting to make. Insider holdings are not an impediment to an acquisition. The only impediment that I see would be intransigence by the board.  If a $5+ offer were made tomorrow and it went to a shareholder vote, it would have a decent chance of getting approved in the absence of a clearly articulated plan to close the discount gap from current management. Thus far, the only ""plan"" I have seen is stay on current course and speed with the existing strategy.  In the end, that may still prevail to build shareholder value. But shareholders have not been rewarded in the last two years.  Has SELF turned the corner in the last two?  The market apparently does not yet think so. There are some good signs, but not enough to attract buyers.",
"Fair enough. But, my understanding is the structure for SELF is such that no one entity owns more than 50% and in order to keep the REIT tax status, SELF has to pass the ""5/50 test"". In fact, the company charter limits beneficial ownership exceeding 9.8% in value or number of shares. Given that dispersion of ownership interest, what would the mechanism be to prevent a shareholder vote on approving a buyout offer at $5 or other value? I suppose the board could simply be intransigent and say ""I don't want to"" and not allow the shareholders to vote. In that case, I would expect at least one or more of the owners give the board the ""F"" word (Fiduciary) and sue. Plenty of attorneys out there that would take that case as a class.  There seems to be general agreement that this thing is deeply discounted. The board cannot simply bury its collective head in the sand and accept a perpetually deep discount.",
"""Aren't the capital raise risks and the ""Credibility"" issues already baked in at the current discounted price?""I would say likely yes, I think you are correct here.As to what impediments stand in the way of them being acquired, I don't think there is much tangible preventing that, and more so is discrepancy in valuations between buyer and SEKF management.  I think at $5/share, there would be interest by the other self storage REITs to pick up this portfolio, but SELF management probably wouldn't sell at that price.  And conversely at the valuation that SELF management would be willing to sell (which I'm guessing is substantially north of $5/share), there isn't much interest from the bigger SS peers in buying at that valuation.  So to me value discrepancy is the biggest impediment to a sale of the company.",
"Some good comments here re: capital raise risks and lack of mgt credibility. Would like to see management's views on these points publicly shared with the owners. It seems the current planned expansion can be financed from cash. A more substantial acquisition will require new capital. Hopefully, any substantial acquisition would be done in a non dilutive, accretive manner on terms favorable to existing shareholders. Here are my questions: Aren't the capital raise risks and the ""Credibility"" issues already baked in at the current discounted price? Other than change of control restrictions in bylaws, what impediments are there, if any, to one of the larger storage operators from acquiring SELF's assets. An acquirer could pay $5 /share and still be at a discount.",
Are you kidding me...this company should not be public...it’s way to small to create any economies of scale and management has zero credibility.  Buyer beware!!!!,
"The reason that SELF trades the way it does is due to the management teams lack of credibility and previous history. Are you aware that SELF purchased Tuxis for $7.87 million, which was more than a 400% premium to where the stock was trading prior to the announcement of the transaction?Tuxis was a money losing operation that was 41% owned by Mark Winmill. The transaction was essentially a $6 million dollar transfer of wealth from SELF's shareholders to Mr. Winmill, his family, and associates who were the owners of Tuxis.If you look into the details of the transaction, you will have a very clear understanding of the discount applied to this company.",
"My biggest concern is an equity raise at such a substantial discount to NAV, which would be very costly. Has anyone spoken to mgmt regarding future capital needs? Mgmts prior history is preventing me from making this a much larger position.",
"The dividend is anything but covered, I'm surprised you missed that.  For the nine months ended 9/30/18, SELF generated 1,469,242 in cash from operations and paid out 1,493,354 in dividends, so the dividend is uncovered.

Under the 43-101 report estimate standard, high grade results get ""cut"".   100 out of 300 drill results were ""cut"" under the standard by 50%.  As Mr Sprott notes, 100 out of 300 is not a statistical anomaly.

"Apple’s iPhone volume will stay +/- unchanged. Few basic points gained or lost from one quarter to another but, what is important, the base will grow and, with that, the services will grow to a point where il will become the most important part of the growth and the main element of Apple’s very diverted revenu stream. iPhone’s revenu importance will become less. Wearables will take over. Apple Watch is already gaining momentum. This is how Apple is planing to ensure the maintain an steady growth of the benefit and cash flow in the mid and long term future. This is how Warren Buffet is seeing Apple and why he is massively investing in Apple. If one wants to trade and his time horizon is less than 2/3 years then he can trade Apple or any other name trying to time the market. But, if one wants to ensure a long term secure invest, no matter the fluctuation of the stock’s price, then he shall pick Apple and do what ever Warren Buffet does.

"I used to read the seeking Alpha articles from my ipad pro. At this moment I`m reading from a thin Lenovo Yoga. I`m only missing the list of popups with all seeking alpha articles. In windows I only see the latest. I think the churn will not be only to android and the play store but also the windows office and Onedrive ecosystem is starting to have a moat. From an android phone you can send content easily to the screen of your tv this is not possible with ios where you need apple tvWindows have a wide user base but really their moat is getting bigger after you make a subscription to office with perfect integration to the cloud. The office-cloud is really retaining users in the windows ecosystem. With a churn to android phones apple will have a slow down in their cloud app store and music services.If the Android market is growing faster so more and more content will become exclusively for android. The Apple IOS ecosystem is in a serious turning point they have a moat of luxury and exclusivity willing the people to pay more for similar hardware If the Android user base become bigger and bigger content developers will start to think ""android first"".

6x is a lot to throw at these metrics,
"For how long does iPhone last? We know that the sales are flat for 4 years at about 220 million per year, there are 500+ million of monthly active App Store users, and the user base is growing double digit. At the first glance, this cannot be true all together. But assuming the iPhone longevity increases with time, it can be all true. Playing with numbers suggests that the life span of iPhone is currently approaching 4 years. This is well inline with the lengthening update cycle narrative.So, purchasing iPhone today one may be concerned that it will be inferior in at least one feature to a 5 times cheaper Android phone in 2022.Having put all the data into Cloud one is likely to learn the lesson and never put his data into someone else’s computer, regardless of how Marketing calls it. Cloud you believe to be secure enough is perfect for the active set of your data, and that is it.The services as seen in the article are a defensive strategy preventing users from leaving Apple. That can win Apple time. Time until what? I guess the better way to look at the Apple ecosystem is to estimate how it helps Android users to join Apple. Is iCloud much better than Dropbox? Or Nextcloud? Apple Music is more important here than iCloud and Store, where Apple has made the most progress. Macs and iPad are even more important, but again Apple has made little or negative progress with them lately. However, the effect of the latest Macs and iPad Pros remains to be seen.Increased iPhone price reached without sales falling and increased income from iCloud and Store mean one thing: users are finding new ways to use iOS devices. This may lead to a new super cycle, but in some more complex way than the article presents.",

An Apple spokesperson stated last week that their latest phone ""...Has been their best seller for each and every day that it's been on the market"". This typically ""Bhuddha-esque statement (worthy of Steve Jobs) may have been in answer to suppliers' statements that appeared to blame that Apple iPhone for lower than expected supplier guidance. That ""non fact"" was then used in an analysts statement which was then quoted by a TV Business News Channel which started the APPL plummet. It doesn't serve any reportage to repeat rumors of rumors.APPL is now an adult company which really shouldn't be judged by unit sales although analysts  love it as they know from Guidance what expenses should be and ASPs. A quick back of the envelope calculation and that's it. Not anymore. There are simply too many entry products/points to Services.I've owned APPL long, for a long, long time, yet I've never heard any analyst say anything similar to: ""It appears that YOY, APPL will increase its Services revenue by 20%"". Analysts are similar to accountants, they're good historians. If they knew about the future they wouldn't be speculating about it. Perhaps they ought to be speculating about new products, i.e. Beddit now sold by Apple online. It will probably be as big a failure as the Watch.",
Good comment.Probably needs a more creative strategy for the future.Although a life long fan - Not sure if they are investing enough to keep their hardware at the ‘bleeding edge’ of technology.

To dominate the 5G space AAPL should buy and build out its own 5G network. Spending cash on buy backs is “lazy” investing. True dynamic company will create growth from cash. The teleco are financially weak having borrowed heavily to buy growth and cash flow. AAPL with its massive war chest and FCF needs to take the lead in 5G. The market is partially correct for punishing AAPL. AAPL should build out the 5G space and stop spent money on has been acquisitions like Beats.,

The main question is will they grow FFO faster than a recession goes down?  I think so and I think they’d be even stronger due to acquisitions in a distressed environment.  Does that mean it will be profitable from an equity perspective? Maybe maybe not.  But over 10 years I have no doubt it will outperform.

Also going with one position rather than three keeps transaction fees a bit lower.On the other side, the individual LPs offer better yields as of today, so no need to wait for dividend growth. Also individual entry points can be chosen.Would be interesting to hear your judgement on going with BAM or individual LPs.Thank you! :-)",
All these Brookfield equity securities have massive amounts of debt - 3x or 4X the market value of the equity depending on how you measure it.  If a an economic downturn comes equity holders will be in jeopardy.  I have a hard time holding a company with this much debt.,

"Quite a few Brookfield (BAM, BEP, BIP, BPY/BPR) writeups on SA over the last few days...it all sounds pretty good, but the LPs seem much more risky unless you want current yield.

First Trip Advisor, then Google Adwords, then Facebook.  I was loyal only to the media that produced results and I tried everything.  In the last several years FB ads overwhelmingly directed traffic to my website and our phones.  It was ridiculous.  Like 10 times more traffic from FB than any other source.  I was not techy enough to use most of the features available.  However our ad budget compared to 15 years ago was 50% with significantly better sales.  Further, to properly ""build"" a FB audience, moving from interest to purchase really requires a consistent presence.  In the last 4 or 5 years I found an even larger adoption of FB by the senior crowd.  Finally, Instagram ads were just starting to get results for me at a nominal cost as I sold.

"The patent dispute between Broad (Editas) and UC Berkeley (CRISPR) is not completely settled at this point. Broad holds that it has patented use of CRISPR in eukaryotic cells (cells with nuclei) while UC maintains its patents are for all cell types including both prokaryotic and eukaryotic types since it didn't specify a type in its patents. Use of CRISPR may require both Broad and UC patents to be licensed depending on the way the parties resolve this dispute. There are many ways that bacteria use CRISPR that that don't involve Cas9 enzymes and development of these techniques could make the whole issue moot in the future. The real race is to get through phase 1/2 trials and be first to market. Editas is ahead with its Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA10) retinal disease treatment with Allergan while CRISPR  is ahead with its beta thalysemia and sickle cell disease human trials. Editas is also working on these diseases and claims its approach is better because it directly edits the gene responsible for restoring fetal hemoglobin rather than the indirect approach taken by CRISPR.

"Below is from the Zacks report on BiondVax's universal influenza vaccine, M-001:""BiondVax is developing the M-001 vaccine, a synthetic peptide-based protein that targets both existing and future seasonal and pandemic strains of the influenza virus. The vaccine targets conserved regions of Type A and B influenza viruses such that M-001 could be considered a “universal” influenza vaccine, capable of offering immunological protection against all strains of the influenza virus.M-001 is composed of nine peptides that are believed to be common to most known influenza strains in existence, in part because these peptides seem to be critical for the virus’ ability to infect a host cell. They are derived from hemagglutinin (HA), matrix 1 (M1) and nucleoprotein (NP) viral proteins and are arranged as triplicates into a single recombinant protein easily manufactured in bacteria. HA is an antigenic glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza viruses and is also the main constituent for a number of seasonal influenza vaccines. However, the peptides from HA in M-001 are derived from the inner parts of the protein where little to no variability between strains exists. M1 is a matrix protein that forms a layer under the patches of the viral cell membrane that contain HA, NA, and M2 proteins, and is responsible for mediating the encapsulation of RNA-nucleoprotein complexes into the membrane envelope (Sha et al., 1997). NP is a structural protein that encapsidates the viral RNA inside the virus.The company recently announced that the first season’s enrollment of 4,089 participants has completed. These individuals will be monitored for two influenza seasons. A second cohort of approximately 6,000 individuals will be enrolled prior to the start of the 2019/2020 influenza season.""Although vaccine is claimed to be ""universal"" to the virus, the current target patient population is limited to the age of 50 and older.Hope it will work.",

Recent developments show this may be beginning to happen.Several cases in point:1.The sale of a VX4000 - the largest printer in the world sold to an Indonesian concern for about $1.3m 2.The largest sand mold for a Pelton Runner ever crafted by a VX4000 in India. 3dprintingzoom.com/... 3. The partnership in Japan - The Design Engineering & Manufacturing Solutions Expo (DMS) in Tokyo is the leading trade fair for IT and additive manufacturing solutions in Japan. Drop by at booth W1-41 where we're showcasing our technology with our Japanese Partner Daiichi Jitsugyo Co., Ltd.-energy equipment solutions for Lithium Batteries.Clearly VJET is on the cusp of achieving scale and once the Asian contribution gets the overall revenue growth rate to 25% and the gross margin of 45%, VJET will sport a very profitable profile that is sustainable year after year. As such, it is completely undervalued at the current price of $2.14",
"So on the logic that the value of  human capital can be quantified, VJET s/b a great stock w/ its 318 employees where many are highly skilled staff. I agree but only when a company can mold their output into a profitable product set.",
"So I made a lot of money in the ""hype"" phase of the company when the stock went up to $90 and then back down when the ""story"" fell apart. If DDD can't make a profit after this many years they are in big trouble. No sale on the virtual value. Thought the new CEO would make a difference but not yet and maybe never. Company is not investable at this point.",
"Jason,Your observations from the technical angle are on target.  $12 has proven to be a significant support level, at least on a weekly closing basis.But price is only part of the equation.  Volume is the other key aspect.The old adage of ""volume precedes price"" surely applies to DDD.On May 9th of this year, DDD rallied on huge volume without any significant news on the wire.  Nearly 25 million shares traded.  This was the largest daily trading volume in more than 4 years.  Closing price was $12.02.Then on July 26, Piper Jaffray downgraded DDD but it came out after the close.  The following day, DDD sold off.  The low on July 27? 12 bucks even, closing the day at $12.41.Less than two weeks later, DDD reported earnings and the stock gapped higher into the 17's.In late October when the disappointing earnings report came out, yes the stock dipped as low as $11.31 but note that the weekly close was again well north of $12.Now, over to the fundamental side.  As you mentioned the company has pumped up its margins.  DDD is growing again after years of stagnating.  The problem in this latest quarter was a lack of available manufacturing capacity to meet demand for 3-D metal printers.  On the CC, management was hinting that this capacity shortfall would be rectified by Q1.  The selloff was quite overdone, in this observer's opinion.  Whatever.  Always relish opportunities to buy great companies when they get moved to the discount aisle.Yes, the indexes are on shaky ground.  Yet there are always sectors or individual names that buck the trend.  DDD may be one of those provided the company can deliver consistent top-line growth.",
Really surprised how you’re all missing the story here. DDD spent a decade developing their technology. Over the last year and a half they have rolled out multiple new printers in multiple markets.  They have signed numerous long term partnerships from Stryker to the US Air Force. Their dental printer is amazing and taking over the market. They are building a large recurring revenue stream and have reached break even. Plenty of cash on hand. I see this company growing  into a $15-20 bl mkt cap in the coming years.  It’s taken time to build this and the time has arrived. The mkt for their products had no supply chain or network 10 years ago. It too has arrived. Look closely. This one is going g to be big. (After the mkt crash though),
Long ddd,
"The Buffett analogy doesn't make any sense. Buffett is proposing an ownership percentage of the future income of a person in perpetuity, basically buying equity in that person. After the initial payment there is no future cash outflow, i.e. after sunk costs, it is 100% upside to Buffet. I doubt this would be legal or enforceable, but I understand this is a hypothetical. The person (employee) has a perpetual liability to Buffett that they cannot escape - again, in this hypothetical. DDD does not own their employees. They have no equity in their employees. The employee can quit at any time. If the employee leaves, DDD has no claim on their income. DDD has to pay the income of the employees, even if they never generate any profit. The employees income is likely to increase every year as well. Unfortunately for DDD, the company can't seem to ever generate a real profit, so the employees are a liability more than an asset. Employees are an asset when they can make a company money.This comparison really doesn't make any sense.You should ask @donzoab for some creative valuation on this one. He says it's going to $90 - a figure he pulled right out of his ___. He literally has no basis for his price target. He can't even get basic facts about the company correct.",
sounds like these guys have truly lived up to their name.just like a stoner's report card.,
Bottom line----these guys have not been able to sell their product at a decent NET profit margin in the history of the company.   Nor have they been able to get their costs under control.  Nor are they able to tell the market a good enough story to keep hopes alive. No matter what the technicals are telling you if the underlying fundamentals suck (they do) it's a gamble and investors don't gamble.

"Because its a different business.  Does AXP do delivery? P2P payments? Websites? - Square is going after different verticals that AXP, and more subscription type services.  Square really isn't competing with AXP and hard to do a comparison in my mind.  Plus their growth rates are different.  Paypal is very different also.  I use Venmo, but I'm not gonna pay a dime to use it, whereas Small businesses need to pay for credit card processing, payroll etc already so SQ is going after things that are valuable in a different sense- so their valuations might be out of whack as well. Comparing P/Es GPV etc isn't a great way in my mind. If you do a deep dive on square's business and project out what they should be earning in a few years then let me know what you come up with...",
"Question for the author, can you please give me your take on the following (a previous comment I made on a SQ article):SQ seems to bring about a number of heated debates. It is worth noting, though, that through the first 9 months of this year the total billings SQ processed were $61.7bn versus $875bn for AXP. AXP processes said transactions at a slightly higher discount rate (2%+ versus about 1.8% for SQ) to my reading.SQ currently has a market cap of about 1/3 of AXP ($30bn versus $90bn) though it processes only 7% of the same volume. Clearly SQ is boasting healthy growth, but it is reasonable to ask if even stupendous growth rates are already baked into the price.",
"There's a lot of people being scared right now, joys of the market.  I don't think its overvalued or undervalued personally.  I had a range of 20-30B right now as its extremely hard to project a high growth business such as this - it got frothy at 100 price point that's for sure with the dilution coming in waves.  SQ is less and less a payment processor and more and more a full business software ecosystem.  If you've used the product you understand how incredibly easy it is to use, and how it will attract businesses for years to come- they have some of the best engineering talent working right now on whole new verticals and SQ cash has a lot of untapped potential like stock trading etc that they've mentioned. - payroll with retirement benefits is great, their appointments app is fantastic, and the consumer side/international is really where they need to attack right now in my mind.  The reason that it's silly to say that banks have or haven't ignored this segment is that times changed.  Square built the cheapest card processor to just attach to a phone on the market as their sole product for small business to get into, and now have access to data that no one else really does.  Square is built from the bottom up for automation and with intention to scale.  No bank branches needed, and while individually small businesses are big credit risk, if you are using their revenue and data for risk screening and to pay for loans etc then it makes it economically viable- especially when using AI and algorithms instead of an army of underwriters.  I think the big concern to me is whether or not Jack will still be thinking about shareholders with Friar gone or whether dilution gets even worse- the adjusted share count on their statements will be interesting to watch.  I'm still long though and happy- they've built a great business that has upside for years.  The combination of buyers and sellers on a software platform as novel as their's really is a moat to me.  Good luck to all, its never easy seeing things go down, but when your still happy to hold then its the business you want to be in long term.  This is my one Speculation stock, but as it gets closer to 20B it looks more and more like its inching on a value.",
i like it here around $63 and started a position.,
"SQ is expensive fundamentally compared to it's peers.  SQ doesn't have any defensible moat.  PYPL, V, and MA to name a few are significantly larger companies that have significant resources.  PYPL is probably the company to compare SQ with.  PYPL doesn't have terminals but has inserted itself as a payment system in current terminals provided by companies like Verifone.  PYPL has a triangle versus a square dongle to take mobile payments on the go.  At the end of the day, SQ is a small payment processor with hyper growth that in a rising ineterest rate environment is not good.The stock has come down a good amount which makes the stock more reasonable.  We are seeing all high P/E growth stocks contract from the year highs find a level that matches the current percieved slow down due to the higher interest rates and the US/China import/export debacle. Until these unkwown variabes are resolved, expect the downsisde to continue with bouts of high volatility.  IMHO, I do believe that buying on the dip has not worked in the last few months but that maybe changing soon if the US can resolve the trade dispute with China and then Europe.  This however is a process that may go well into next year.  At least we have a resolution in interest rates hikes.  The FOMC will likely announce a slow down in interest rate hikes next year during the December 19th anticipated rate hike. For those who own SQ at higher prices, unfortunately, it will be awhile for SQ to be making 52 week highs.  The bottoming is a process and high valuations need to become reasonable valuations before moving higher again. I do think we are bottoming, and SQ could be bought or accumulated  on large down days.  Good luck to all !",

"Around 2000 the computer industry/market got really frothy and a lot of companies went down because of crazy business ideas but quality businesses survived the upset and have grown during the intervening years - - My questions to the general public are:1)   does this company have a good business concept?  2)  How does it stack up against competitors?   3)  Most importantly, is the corporate board innovative enough to keep their head above water and grow the company or are they like corporate raiders who destroy companies in order to rape the profits? Personally I liked the concept of Square because it was great for the beginning business owner, but does Square have what it takes to grow with that business as the needs change?",

"Bill, I usually respect your articles but seriously are you insane? Have you seen a classic bubble set up any more pronounced than this one?

Several reputable articles show how the strategy of “buying the dip” isn’t working in our current market.   Sometimes it works but buying now is a stupid strategy.,

"Apple makes it’s money on phones. Period. If the phones aren’t selling, Apple is in trouble. The phones aren’t selling. Ergo.....",
"Keep it simple and stupid. Let´s assume there would be no growth. The speculated decline in iPhones get compensated by Services, IPads, etc.. Every year a free cash flow of 70 Billion of which 13 Billion gets distributed as dividends. Leaves 57 Billion for buy backs or other things. Let's assume buybacks. Current net cash position is approx. 120 Billion. This amount will be spend within 2 years funding buybacks. At the end of spending 120 Billion there will be another 114 Billion in cash available for further buybacks. At the end of spending those 114 Billion within another two years there will be another 114 Billion in cash. It goes on and on and on. Within 6 years the could make (120+114+114) 358 Billion (nearly half of the current valuation) in stock repurchases. Just imagine this and you will see that Apple is a monster and the share price will at least double the next 4 to 5 years. In the moment they stop repurchasing stocks, they will need to hike dividend to at least 6 Dollars a share (if not more) and would still have 30 Billion in cash for Acquisitions or serious investments.

"Todd:  As I stated in most of my previous posts, I mean zero disrespect against the individuals who post articles on this website or those who respond to them.  I am Pro-Domestic Energy regardless of my posts regarding Harold Hamm and CLR.   As far as Harold Hamm and CLR are concerned, you only have the financial information provided by HH and CLR, to go by.  I ask that you start looking at things from a technology side of things.   HH and CLR rely on the investors and regulatory agencies lack of knowledge and understanding of his operation and the technology involved.  HH and CLR also rely on the lack of follow-up regarding previous statements and reports. .  I have extensive knowledge of his operation and the technology involved.When my story comes out, you will see what HH and CLR have said and done in an attempt to keep me quiet.  Just waiting for the Democrats to assume control of the House Of Representatives.  As you stated in your reply, the reference material that you rely on for your articles, are the Earnings Call Transcripts and Charts that Harold Hamm and CLR provide.  Consider the following:HH and CLR's Earnings Transcripts:  First, look at the Q3/2017 Earnings Call Transcript.  Harold Hamm makes the following statement, directly after the introductory statement from J. Warren Henry:   ""In late October(2017), we surpassed 300,000 BOE Per Day of production for the first time in our company's history, with 59% of production being oil.""  I knew this was coming because 2017 was the final year of HH and CLR's 5 year plan to triple production and proved reserves.  This plan was announced on October 8, 2012.  The second paragraph contains the following content from Harold Hamm.  ""Compared with the 2012 five-year strategic growth plan, we achieved 300,000 BOE Per Day of production with $10 billion less CAPEX than planned and with half as many wells.""Now look at Jack Stark's(CLR's President) comment that is located in the Q3/2018 Earnings Call Transcript: This can be found directly after Harold Hamm's comments.  ""We exited the third quarter producing approximately 304,000 BOE Per Day, and the oil production was on the rise.""Simple Question:  Are Harold Hamm Continental Resources stating that they just spent $2.1 billion in Non-Acquisition Capex during the first 3 quarters of 2018, in-order to maintain late October 2017's production rate???  REMINDER:  Harold Hamm stated that production had ""surpassed 300,000 BOE Per Day for the first time in the history of the company "" during late October 2017.lol wut's comment listed above:  ""nothing will fix the decline rates"".  I agree 1000%.  I have been studying the decline rates since 2012.   UNDERSTANDING THE TECHNOLOGY:  I ask you to consider the following:Q4/2017:  Harold Hamm and CLR reported a 44,197 BOEPD production increase versus Q3/2017.   Q4/2017:  286,985 BOEPD vs.  Q3/2017:  242,788 BOEPD == 44,197 BOEPD According to CLR's SEC filings, this was accomplished utilizing $496 million and 50 net new wells.  I was shocked to put it mildly.  This 44,197 BOEPD increase was 11,270 BOEPD more than the first 3 quarters of 2017 combined.  According to CLR's SEC filings, 163 net wells were completed during the first 3 quarters of 2017. 163-50= 113 fewer wells.  WOW.Quarterly 2017 Wells:  According to Harold Hamm and CLR's SEC filings, the quarterly net new wells were reported as follows:  Q1=31  Q2=52  Q3=80.  Notice the incrementally increasing pattern per quarter.  Q3/2017's increase vs. Q2/2017 was reported at 16,575 BOEPD, despite 80 net new wells.  Q3/2017:  242,788 BOEPD vs. Q2/2017:  226,213 BOEPD== 16,575 BOEPD.   Q3/2017:  242,788 BOEPD vs.  Q4/2016:  209,861 BOEPD== 32,927 BOEPD.  Q4/2017:  44,197 BOEPD -  32,927 BOEPD(First 3 QTR's of 2017)== 11,270 BOEPD.Harold Hamm's Catch-22:  By releasing Q4/2017's  magical 44,197 BOEPD production increase, using 50 net wells, Harold Hamm could no longer use the Rapid Decline Rate/Significant Early Decline In Initial Production as an excuse for any drop in production.  HEADS-UP:  Before you come back at me with Production Rates, especially 30 day rates, please understand that I have done all of the calculations(The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources Monthly Production Reports are a great research tool).  I can tell you that every well, especially those in the BAKKEN that were completed during Q4/2017, would've been required to be a RECORD PRODUCER.Simple Question:  Keeping in mind that HH and CLR reported increasing production by 73,230 BOEPD during the final 3 quarters of 2017, using approximately $1.5 billion in CAPEX and 182 Net New Wells, how does he explain the 9,919 BOEPD production increase during the first 3 quarters of 2018, despite $2.1 billion in CAPEX and 163 net wells(SEC filings)????  Q3/2018:  296,904 BOEPD vs. Q4/2017:  286,985 BOEPD== 9,919 BOEPD. February 21, 2018 Investor Relations Press Release:  Harold Hamm's comment:  ""As we made clear in our 2018 guidance announcement, we expect even stronger performance in 2018 with significant production growth and robust free cash flow"".Simple Question:  Is the 9,919 BOEPD 3 quarter production increase Harold Hamm's definition of ""significant production growth???  Especially considering that Harold Hamm and CLR have spent more during the first 3 quarters of 2018 than all of 2017???orShouldn't Harold Hamm and CLR's production be well over 400,000 BOEPD by the end of Q3/2018???  Especially considering Q4/2017's 44,197 BOEPD single quarter production increase???  One final thought:   Free Cash Flow and Net Income:  Even though I stated that EOG was like kissing my sister, Harold Hamm and CLR cannot even come close to EOG.  When Harold Hamm and CLR announced their $400 million dollar partial redemption of 2022's $2 billion in Senior Notes, I predicted that they would borrow at least half($200 million) from the revolving credit facility.  When they announced the deal with Franco-Nevada, I predicted that they would use the proceeds to repay the credit facility.  Harold Hamm and CLR borrowed $190 million from the credit facility( I was only $10 million off) and as I predicted, they repaid the credit facility with the proceeds from Franco-Nevada.  Why??  Their Interest Expense:  Looks like another year where the interest expense will approach or exceed $300 million dollars.  Best of luck to you Todd",
Next Week,
Thanks. Very interesting color on the reasons behind the derivatives sale...short-term fix for long-term pain...can't wait for more of your insights. Thanks and all the best for the New Year.,
"Oil and Gas Interest:   We were broke at the end of Q3/2014.  HH sold the hedges in-order to help fund Q4/2014 and 2015's CAPEX plan.    I was required to approach my service companies and demand a 15%-20% price cut.  10 Frack Crews to 3 by the end of Q1/2015.  Despite using $630 million dollars of the proceeds from 2014's $1.7 billion Senior Note Offering to fully repay the revolving credit facility, plus selling the hedges for the $433 million one time gain, we still borrowed $165 million from the revolving credit facility during Q4/2014 in-order to operate. Please read HAMMSCAMM's Q3/2014 SEC Filing, pages 28-29 under the derivative liquidation, where it states what the $433 million one time gain was used for.  Then read HAMMSCAMM's comment on page 1 of the Q3/2014 Investor Relations Press Release(November 5, 2014), located on CLR's public website.  He claims his reasoning behind selling the hedges was to take advantage of the price recovery.  Yeah OKI had the guts to call him out.   Keep in mind that I took an oath when I joined the Army to protect this country from all enemies, foreign and DOMESTIC.  This was long before 9/11.  We still have a great opportunity within Domestic Energy, but we cannot have the BERNIE MADOFF of Domestic Energy trying to dictate policies in-order to save his own ass. Will be coming out shortly.",
"Thanks. That is indeed useful color. Never trusted Harold Hamm. Seems like a classic self-promoter, on a shale scale! When he took off all the hedges in November 2014 just before the OPEC meeting, that just showed how reckless he was with the firm, and how clearly no one could stop him inside the firm. Scary governance issues right there...",
"Oil and Gas Interest:  You are 100% correct on debt roll-over(read below).  Harold Hamm's Ponzi-Scheme Economics is part of a much larger picture.   I am just waiting for the Democrats to take control of the House and then my story will come out.  Timing is everything.  I can tell you that I am Pro-Domestic Energy(all forms) and I am trying to protect it.  I am currently working in the Permian for one of the largest oil and gas service companies in the world. My Opinion Only:  Shale Production is nothing more than the Low Hanging Fruit, brought on by President Obama's restrictive energy policies.  Harold Hamm and Continental Resources are exactly whats wrong with Domestic Energy.   By the end of the second quarter 2011, Harold Hamm could not afford to develop and produce the BAKKEN without a dramatic increase in spending and debt.  This was due to the Rapid Decline Rate( I have been studying this since 2012, when I was with Halliburton.  All he had to do was sell his BAKKEN operation to a much larger Producer(EXXON, Chevron), then call it a day.   A perfect example of this is how the ""Bigs"" are currently courting Endeavor in the Permian.  Instead, Harold Hamm ramped up his pursuit of power and money, with the end result being his title as President Trump's Domestic Energy Expert.  This has allowed Harold Hamm unlimited access to the White House, which included a front row seat with the President during the recent mid-term elections.  All Based On A Lie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The ""Shale Only"" producers that do not have multiple methods of extraction, operate in a limited geographical area and/or not owned by the Larger Oil and Gas Companies( Exxon Mobil owns XTO and Conoco Phillips owns Burlington Resources) are financial disasters.  I like EOG, but it is like kissing my sister.   If Endeavor is bought by one of the ""Bigs"", it would become immediately attractive, especially considering the recent USGS survey regarding the Permian.  I also like Hess, due to the fact that they are getting bolder with other projects(Guyana).  There are others, but that is a different story.I also think that the Domestic Shale Producers need a ""Reckoning"".  The pretenders, like Continental Resources need to be eliminated.  Again, this will come out shortly.Here are a couple of hints for you to contemplate.  ""CLR would soon be such a cash machine that they would be able to retire debt"".  EXACTLY MY POINT!!!!   During the final 2 quarters of 2017, Harold Hamm reported increasing production by 60,772 BOEPD, utilizing approximately 130 Net New Wells and slightly over $1 billion in Non-Acquisition CAPEX.  42,685 BOPD was crude oil.   HAROLD HAMM's MAGIC ACT during Q4/2017.  HAMMSCAMM reported a 44,197 BOEPD production increase during Q4/2017, utilizing approximately $496 million in CAPEX and according to his SEC filings, 50 Net New Wells.  This 44,197 BOEPD increase was 11,270 BOEPD more than the first 3 quarters of 2017 combined and almost as large as 2014's 49,202 BOEPD, 4th quarter-to-4th quarter increase($4.81 billion in CAPEX and 377 net new wells in the BAKKEN and SCOOP). According to his SEC filings, 163 net new wells were completed during the first 3 quarters of 2017, yet Q4's 50 net wells were such strong producers that they accounted for the production increase that was 11,270 BOEPD more than what the 163 net wells accounted for during the first 3 quarters of 2017.  Keeping in mind that 2018's original CAPEX Plan totaled $2.3 billion dollars and was increased to $2.7 billion dollars.Simple Question:  If HAMMSCAMM's production reports were legitimate, especially Q4/2017's, why not reduce 2018's CAPEX Plan from the original $2.3-$2.7 billion to the same $1.08 billion that was spent during the final 2 quarters of 2017 and apply the remaining $1.2-$1.6 billion towards debt reduction????  Production should still increase by 50,000-60,000 BOEPD and CLR's stock would be well over $100 per share.REMINDER: During 2015, Harold Hamm reported a 47,526 BOEPD, year-over-year increase versus 2014, despite having to reduce 2015's original Non-Acquisition CAPEX plan from $5.2 Billion to $2.5 Billion.  2014's year-over-year increase versus 2013 totaled 38,270 BOEPD. 2014's final CAPEX was reported at $4.81 Billion Dollars.Simple Question:  Why did Harold Hamm borrow $1 billion dollars on December 4, 2017 and use the entire $1 billion in borrowings to repay $1 billion in previous borrowings, if his production reports were actually legitimate???  Especially Q4/2017's 44,197 BOEPD increase(50 Net Wells).Secondly:  Have you taken the time to look at Harold Hamm's Net Production since Q4/2014??  Net production has increased from Q4/2014's 193,456 BOEPD to Q3/2018's 296,904 BOEPD.  This increase totals 103,448 BOEPD.  However, the Net Crude Oil Production increase only accounts for 27,633 BOPD/27%, while Harold Hamm's Natural Gas Production accounts for the remaining 75,815 BOEPD/73%.I thought Harold Hamm and CLR were ""America's Oil Champion""????   Looks like Harold Hamm and CLR are America's Natural Gas Champion.More to follow",
"Future pilot, very impressed by your knowledge of the firm as a former insider. Do you see any shale producer as having decent potential (assuming decent commodity prices)? DVN, ECA, AR, EOG, PXD, etc. Any would qualify? The only comment I would make, if I may, is that most corporations issue debt to retire old debt. That is, they rollover the debt. It is rare to find firms that payoff all the debt. It seems that the shale players that have little debt issue equity all the time (eg CDEV). Very interested in your thoughts as an insider. It seems impossible to reconcile high IRRs claimed with continuous need to issue equity or debt. With 100% IRRs, it seems that a firm like CLR would soon be such a cash machine that they should be able to retire debt, no? Clearly those IRRs are totally meaningless. First because most don’t include any acquisition costs or G&A costs. Just curious if you think there are “best of breed” shale producers who can actually generate FCFs. Thanks in advance for your input!",
"This is PART 1 of 2 related to this article.  A friend advised me that this article was posted.  I had to read it for myself.  As I stated in my response to the previous article that dealt with CLR's Top Tier Acreage not lasting forever, my analysis is not meant as disrespect to the author or those who have submitted posts.  As a former employee, I understand Harold Hamm and CLR's operation very well, especially in the BAKKEN.  Some of the information in this response will be similar to my last post, found in the Top Tier Acreage Article.  Do your own follow-up and formulate your own opinion.First of all, HH and CLR are in survival mode.  As I posted in my previous response, I had the guts to tell them that if oil prices didn't recover quickly, CLR was in serious trouble.   I knew that if I was correct in my assessment, they would do everything possible to discredit me(including perjury under oath).  Needless to say, I ensured that proper protections were set in motion prior to my visit to Oklahoma City.  I can tell you that I have watched their every move for the last couple of years and they have done everything that I predicted and warned of.  I just know where to look.  I am not afraid of Harold Hamm, he is nothing more that a paper tiger.  My story will be coming out shortly.  Timing is everything.Harold Hamm has no respect for the investors or the regulatory agencies.  He completely expects the investors to take his word as the gospel.  He relies on the investor's lack of knowledge and understanding of his operation and the technology involved.  I understand both very well.  Harold Hamm relies on the complete lack of follow-up regarding previous production reports and press releases.  Again, do your own research.1.)  Production:  How does Harold Hamm explain the following contradiction between his statement that he made during the Q3/2017 earnings call transcript and the statement made by Jack Stark(CLR's President) during the Q3/2018 earnings call transcript. Copies of these earnings call transcripts can be found on this website.  Consider the following:Harold Hamm Q3/2017:  During late October(2017), we surpassed 300,000 BOEPD in production for the first time in the history of our company.  Harold Hamm called this a ""Historic Milestone"".Jack Stark Q3/2018:  We exited Q3/2018 with production of approximately 304,000 BOEPD. This production rate is listed in Todd's article.How is this possible??  Is Harold Hamm and CLR stating that the Rapid Decline Rate/Significant Early Decline In Initial Production is severely impacting his operation to the point where he spent $2.1 billion dollars during the first 3 quarters of 2018 to LOSE PRODUCTION?????  During the final 3 quarters of 2017, Harold Hamm and Continental Resources increased production by 77,230 BOEPD, utilizing $1.5 billion dollars in Non-Acquisition CAPEX.  This included Q4/2017's magical 44,197 BOEPD single quarter production increase, utilizing $496 million in CAPEX and 61-63 net new wells.  Yet, during the first 3 quarters of 2018, Harold Hamm has spent $2.1 billion dollars that has resulted in a net production gain of 9,919 BOEPD.  Q4/2017= 286,985 BOEPD       Q3/2018= 296,904 BOEPD.FACT:  The only way Harold Hamm's 2017 reported production rates are legitimate is if production at the end of 2017 was approximately 340,000 BOEPD to 350,000 BOEPD. How did I determine this rate??  I know where to look.  Here is a hint:  During the Q2/2017 Investor Relations Press Release, which came out during early August 2017, Harold Hamm noted that production had recently surpassed individual days of output totaling 250,000 BOEPD.  So, by the end of July/Early August 2017 through Late October(2017), Harold Hamm and CLR had dramatically increased production from individual days of output of 250,000 BOEPD to SURPASSING, KEY WORD SURPASSING, 300,000 BOEPD.  A 50,000 BOEPD or more increase in a 3 month period.  I will not try to explain the math or my knowledge of the technology.Simple question:  Considering the amazing production increases, reported during the final 3 quarters of 2017, combined with all of Harold Hamm, Jack Stark and John Harts comments, shouldn't CLR's production be well over 400,000 BOEPD by now???  Especially, considering the $2.1 billion dollars in Non-Acquisition CAPEX??  The magical 44,197 BOEPD Q4/2017 production increase???FACT: If Harold Hamm actually had the ability to increase production by 44,197 BOEPD in a single quarter, using $496 million and 61-63 net new wells, why did he feel it necessary to borrow $1 billion dollars on December 4, 2017 in-order to repay the exact debt that I predicted and warned of earlier??  He could have kept 2018's CAPEX plan at $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion, increased production by 60,000 BOEPD-70,000 BOEPD and used the other $1 billion dollars to repay $ 1 billion in previous borrowings.December 4, 2017:  Harold Hamm and CLR borrowed $1 billion dollars, through Senior Notes, and used the entire $1 billion in borrowings to repay previous borrowings.  What were the previous borrowings???$500 million of the borrowings was used to repay the $500 million, 3 year term loan that was due on November 4, 2018.  Harold Hamm borrowed the $500 million on November 4, 2015 and used the $500 million in borrowings to reduce the borrowings owed to the revolving credit facility(approximately $1.3 billion).  Harold Hamm borrowed the $1.3 billion from the revolving credit facility during Q4/2014-Q3/2015 in-order to fund help fund operations.  The remaining $500 million that was borrowed on December 4, 2017 was used to reduce the borrowings owed to the revolving credit facility.PONZI SCHEME ECONOMICS:  If you did your research, you would see that Harold Hamm and CLR have borrowed approximately $9 billion dollars since the 2007 IPO and have used almost $5 billion of the proceeds to repay previous debt.  I know I know, several of the smaller shale producers, like CLR, use Ponzi Scheme Economics.  Whiting Petroleum is another disaster, but that is a different story.Simple Question:  What did Harold Hamm do with the $215 million that he received from Franco-Nevada during October 2018????Answer:  He repaid the $190 million that he borrowed from the revolving credit facility in-order to help fund the $400 million dollar partial redemption of 2022's $2 billion Senior Note Offering.  Look at John Hart's comments in the Q3/2018 earnings call transcript and CLR's 10-Q.Reminder September 2017:  Jim Chanos ""Shorts Continental Resources"".  Harold Hamm immediately responded, stating that Mr. Chanos didn't know what he was talking about.  Mr. Chanos is the same guy who predicted ENRON.  I can tell you that he is correct again.  Remember the word ENRON.January 31, 2018 Reminder:  Harold Hamm appeared on CNBC's Squawk On The Street and claimed that the BAKKEN was better than ever and the technology is amazing and that they are only in the third inning.  You can still find the video online.  Just google Harold Hamm/CNBC January 31, 2018 BAKKEN is better than ever.  According to his production reports, looks like 2017 was CLR's crowning moment.  I know I know, Harold Hamm is advising President Trump and now has Senator Elect Kevin Cramer in his pocket. I tried to warn, then Congressman Cramer, that Harold Hamm was no longer legitimate, but all he was interested in was warning Harold Hamm that ""I Knew"".  That new airport that they recently finished in Williston, ND???  I recommended against it during a meeting with then Congressman Cramer. HAROLD HAMM's RECENT MAGIC:  Now HIS Think Tank is stating that there are 30-40 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the BAKKEN.  WOW!!!  During 2012, Time Magazine named Harold Hamm one of their Top 100 Most Influential People In The World, based on his 20 billion barrel GUESS back in 2011. Maybe President Trump will make him a Knight.  I forgot, that is only in England.   FACT:  The USGS has NEVER confirmed this.FACT:  Harold Hamm is now attempting to influence the upcoming BAKKEN USGS survey.  There are several articles on the internet that cover the upcoming survey.  WHY??  THE PERMIAN.  Anyone see the new USGS survey that came out a few days ago???  I am pretty sure it stated that there is approximately 46 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the Permian.Harold Hamm will still need to borrow from outside investors in-order to survive. His interest expense is killing him.  Looks like another $300 million in interest expense this year.  NO ONE IS RUSHING TO THE BAKKEN!!!.  PART 2 will be completed in the next couple of days.  I will detail specific production and financial Red Flags.",
Todd I  take  interests in these  wells  used to be in the business the returns for me have dropped  to a high as  100%  per  year now down to 60% not  counting writeoff these wells do so much better than the stocks in the companies  lots  of money to be  made at oil companies at  these  prices and I am promoted at  high price to get in with my 1% but its  worth it,
"Shallow,I see, that is about the same price the Eagle Ford is getting at $48.  However, 58% of CLR's oil production comes from the Bakken and with it trading at a HEFTY $26.50, I would imagine that is going to bring the average down from the STACK & SCOOP to a large degree Q4 2018.Regardless, 75% of the shale oil producers, according to Rystad Energy, are still spending more capex than cash from operations.  And, that is when oil prices were a lot nicer a few months back.",
Any idea what CLR is getting paid in the Bakken for oil and natural gas at present?,
"1.  $65 to $55 is a big deal for these guys. Not saying that it will make them go BK (doubt it).  But it substantially impacts their returns and how many locations are NPV positive.  Their was a good article in the WSJ that summed it up for the entire industry.  ""All that cash flow we were talking about is gone now"".  2.  100% return at $65 oil doesn't even mean anything.  There is no way that most of their projects have that return.  It's just meaningless to throw out phrases like that.  Show me the NPV-DCF financial model to justify that.  (I will plug in 100% for the WACC and see if I get a still positive NPV.)  I don't believe it.  It's just absurd.  I don't even understand what the industry is saying with remarks like that.",
"LOL. These numbers are ridiculous. Just like EOG can ""do fine"" at $40/WTI? I don't think so""Finally"" allowing an entry? I paid $40 a little over a year ago.

"It is interesting that on the day after your report that is well-reasoned on valuation if you ask me, DA Davidson issued a ""buy"" recommendation with a $209 price target. What are they seeing that causes them to think the company is worth $107 more per share than you do?",

In addition, having them out their looking over the shoulders of Sam and Justin puts some pressure on them to get this ship turned around.

"If the dollar weakings a bit and copper gets back over $3.00 dollars, FCX should be just fine.Tiger",
"I think the paltry $.87 a share profit for 2019 is a misleading estimate because it is more or less based on the present price of copper, which has dropped from it's recent high of $3.30 or so. As this slide in copper price happened next years profit per share estimates have dropped accordingly.At the present price of $2.75 or whatever, a U.S. and worldwide slowdown has been kind of priced in. NOT priced in is the fact there are NO new mines from ANY major copper producer that will be coming on line either next year or in the forseeable future. Copper is predicted to start coming into 'short supply' by the middle of next year (I forget by who.)FCX, to the best of my memory, can still be profitable with copper at just UNDER $2.00. Most other major producers are at break even at about $2.50 or so.If you are of the mind that both the U.S. and the world economies are on the verge of collapse then you wouldn't want to be in any commodity right now. I think the U.S. is humming along rather well, and will be next year as well. The China trade fiasco will settle down early into next year, and I predict FCX will earn closer to $1.40 next year than the current prediction $.87 because of MUCH HIGHER copper prices, and I'm usually a short selling pessimist. I'm averaged in at $12.34 right now, HOOKED for the present, but intend to by more in the $11 range, and even buy more if it drops to $10.50.Good luck to ALL. And ""Merry Christmas,"" NOT 'Happy Holidays.'",
"FCX is like a drunk driver . . . all over the road.  My only real saving grace is that I'm in at a fairly low average cost from late 2015.  Thought copper's dynamics would have been much stronger now based on the average price/lb. at the start of `18 and the year's relative economic strength.  No doubt the dollar's strength and China trade issues have been problematic - along with the planned dive in `19 earnings due to the block cave conversion.  I've sat through every earnings call since I've been a stockholder, and frankly never get the ""warm and fuzzies"" afterwards.",
"Executive pay should be tied to profit.  If the company makes more profit, execs get more pay.  Company loses money, execs get no pay.  By the way, how much copper is in Chinese warehouses?",
"IMO, from a fundamental perspective, this is a commodity play pure and simple, tied to the price of copper and to a much lesser extent, the price of gold.  Throw in a dash of salt with the value of the dollar and its impact on the price of copper to the worldwide demand.One of the recurring themes underlying investment in any miner whether it be gold, copper or otherwise, is the lack of management’s compensation being tied to the performance of the stock. These executives are very well compensated, regardless if the stock performs well or not. The only risk to the management team compensation is the lack of sustainable cash flow to cover the these labor costs.  Otherwise, they are good to go without much concern as to the company’s performance.This practice needs to change at the BOD level. Senior executives need to has significant  percentage of their compensation tied to the risks being absorbed by the shareholders. They need to participate in that risk.One way to do this is to equate company performance to the price of the underlying commodity. By subtracting out the impact of commodity price on financial performance, what you have left is the impact of management decision making on the price of the stock.  That should be the basis for coming up with an executive compensation plan that rewards them when the management decision making has been good ( the performance of the stock is positive after subtracting out the impact of commodity prices) and brings the hammer down when the performance of the stock is negative after considering the impact of commodity prices.Will this ever happen? Since mining is a “good old boys club” it will take a radical change in its approach to managing starting at the BOD level, down.However, we also need to keep in mind, when the price of a commodity is riding  a wave up, a lot of poor management decision making can be covered up by the increase of the commodity price. That doesn’t make it right, but it means that money can be made during these times.Boom/ Bust mentality, baby.....",

"Vlad, I've watched FCX for years and been in and out. It's truly one of the most volatile stocks in the market. It is a trading stock only and anyone attempting to time it has to be very nimble. With the recent concerns about a global slowdown, particularly in China, this could easily fall lower. As you know, it's all about copper prices. FCX is another of one of Carl Ichan's big misses and he threw in the towel a couple of years ago. Also, whenever I consider jumping in this one I remember the fact that one of Warren Buffet's main rules is never to invest in anything tied to commodities.",

"@Business Quant Micron had $10b to use for share buybacks.

@Business Quant Thank you for the great article.  Very nice and informative charts and content.,
"Nice article Business Quant.More evidence that Micron's stock price decline is directly correlated to the international trade hostilities.The fundamentals are telling you to buy this trough which is why the short interest isn't there, but since the actions of Trump and Xi are the unpredictable unknown the market isn't willing to bet either way.Current stock price is extremely attractive, but none of that matters if Trump decides to slow the global economy more. I'm expecting Sanjay to guide conservatively on December 18th, but I'd like to think he chose to pre-announce a slight beat in EPS because guidance will be flat and not down. The only time Micron didn't pre-announce was last Q when EPS was hit by the higher tax rate and they guided down. I could be totally wrong though.",

Since the last call the margins have collapsed in the market, but because they hedged, REGI's margins should have been protected. More importantly, the hedge shouldn't include the RIN. When REGI hedged, RIN prices were low, now RIN prices are high. That should be a huge benefit for REGI. Counterintuitively, REGI should do better when margins collapse because the Margin is protected, and they get the bonus from the RIN price increase.

"Hi;First I have no financial relationship with or own long or short any WorkDay stock.I architect and develop large enterprise wide data warehouses/ data lakes/ data integrations. BI solutions/ analytics and reporting systems for higher education.The old world higher ed used Ellucians's Banner system an old Oracle data base system and controls > 50% of the market. Banner was very slow in adapting to newer Web2.0 front ends and adapting newer technologies which opened an opportunity in the higher ed market.A number of colleges and universities at first started with WorkDay with the HCM module then added the financial module. I was involved with these migrations and saw what happened next. After WorkDay saw many colleges and univeristies adopting their cloud solutions for these two modules they then realized that colleges offer a new marker niche as they understand hcm and financials is a mature market.  WorkDay then invited sitdowns and discussions with higher ed and addressed what other needs they have.Soon WorkDay saw the opportunity for a new multi billion TAM sitting right in front of them. Already having these colleges and universities for some of their data they understood that a relationship was established and selling would be a lot easier. Also these customers left Banner for a reason. Cha-ching!!  Talks about new modules soon evolved and WorkDay announced they would begin to build out the Student module and then the Financial aid module and then the planning module.Along the way WorkDay started to buy other companies and offer additional technologies. The created a new product called Prism which works just like an ETL tool to integrate data from multiple systems and act like a data warehouse like structure.I was in a training for prism and with me were developers from at least 10 fortune 1000 co's 1 fortune 50, very impressive.Wehn all is said an ddoone WorkDay will have the followinf modules.HCMFinancialsStudentFinancial AidPlanningThey will eventually complete the entire suite of HigherEd needs and will eventually add the additional modules:Student Application portalDegree AuditingStudent PortalAdvancementEvent planningLAst week I was told Indian River state in FL. was the first college to go live with WorkDay Student.I found out today tow more New England universities are moving to WorkDay as well.So thats 5 now in NE and 2 in Ca that I am aware off and just recently IBM started offering positions for WorkDay higher ed integrations developers.They have a very large TAM moving forward how much I do no tknow but I can assur eoyu colleges and universities would spend MILLIONS of dollars to convert their old system and build new warehouses unless they really wanted out of Banner and they do. Long  term I expect WorkDay to capture > 25% of the higher ed market and slowly take Banner's > 50% market share maybe worth 2 billion in recurring revs ( just guessing but talking > 1k schools)I have over the last month received 11 emails about jobs looking for people in this field so it is developing fast.You can respond with questions.I rushed through this post so forgive any typos.",

Getting equal treatment for both is what the big holders of EEQ wanted, and that is what they got.

They wAited for hearing as turncoat outgoing dirtball senators like Flake and Corker would do anything until the end to screw Trump. I look for early confirmation and possibly even a short delay in EIS release. Jan 16 date not etched in stone . EPA ruling will come whenever as government agencies are totally unpredictable. Get these things accomplished and hopefully clear sailing for a new partner!,
Cannot wait for the 16th ....,
steve099... the SP hit that level very rapidly after the 2016  election of Trump and the nomination of Pruitt at EPA and his original removal. He of course stabbed us in the back with his followup  actions.I see no reason why we cant return to that level with the removal and then higher with EIS being great and financing/partnering. Throw in a sort squeeze and maybe a big overshoot. guess we will find out soon enough.....would be a nice holiday gift.....FQM backed out on May25 and gave us a big   hit on my birthday....did not make me happy...a big bit of news before Dec25 could make up for it,
to grol1971..... just my humble opinion. I have been in this for years and bought massive positions when it tanked to .28-.35 and then a ton more  recently when it hit .45. when I saw DEIS was due Jan16 I bought a ton of Jan $1 calls ages ago for around a .03 average..... hoping the EIS report causes a spike. Casino money. time will tell....,
"thanks, DocMark",
NAK will most likely not be built until  the US Government needs the gold after the dollar is no longer the world's reserve currency. Then there will be political pressure to build it.,
I would add the Draft EIS is scheduled for release on January 16th. This will be the first time an objective third party has assessed the mine plan and its potential effect on the environment. A clean DEIS should put to bed any misinformation on the threat to Bristol Bay. I think this is what potential partners are waiting on before signing on with NDM.,
"grol1971.... it is nearly impossible to predict pricing. If FQM deal  had been completed it would have set price in $7-9 range( using $1.5 billion for 50%). I would anticipate price jumping to at least $3-4 short term assuming EPA positive move, good DEIS, and repartnering then  a significant upside once permitting is completed. Remember that this stock was $22 in February 2011 on nothing but pure hype. With some good news being released I anticipate a big spike relating to the de- risking of the project , short sellers getting squeezed, and greater institutional participation. Hopefully we get an exponential parabolic overshoot....which can happen with many speculative stocks. As for now.... a few bucks a share would be very nice....",
"I am a former Alaskan resident and moved to New Zealand nearly 20 years ago. I continue to invest globally, and enjoy less mining resistance profitability (than the USA) accordingly; however have about $200,000 speculated in NAK / NDM. Hands-on mining exploration experiences have included BHP in Western Australia & EntreeGold adjacent to Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia. Mining friendly jurisdictions will continue to compete with NAK partnerships. I don’t believe many mining analysts (including this one) fully appreciate that investment risk ratio analysis would yield considerably higher risks in the USA as compared to Canada, for example. The US EPA AND general zealot environmental protection movements within the USA have continued to escalate in parallel with the political divisions by political parties in general & by the on-going potential collapse of the US economy —- largely associated with debt / Interest rate manipulations we all have observed for years now. Now, Agreeably, Barrick or Freeport-McMoran are the best current partners. They’ll await two factors to arise prior to heating up partnering with NAK: yes, the Federal EPA review result AND more critically, the impending economic collapse of the US economy, when market forces finally & legitimately are enabled to drive up both copper & gold values. Signs of a free market befreement from Central banking & US Fed interest rate manipulation are now showing. The Trump Trade Wars, likely a US concern that US economic hubris enjoyed since the conclusion of WWII is coming to conclusion & that Chinese (in particular) colonisation gains globally are seriously affecting this global dominance of the past — well, we all have seen anything associated with these geo-political machinations & non-fundamental manipulations affect natural resource prices, so-much-so that miming pundits are finding mine valuations difficult to factor into their analyses.Have readers of these commentary forums fully appreciate the extent by which Artificial Intelligence, viz. computer share transactions, global unification movements, particularly by nation state governments ( note: central banking governor meetings, re: digital-currency controls, interest rates) layered over capital market activity are affecting legitimate market economics. Moreover, with China Incorporated changing such arenas currently as the EV element markets, Rare Earth Elements, copper, gold, etc. , specifically how venture capital investment behaviour is being done, with the Chinese streaming, even royalty investment strategies & profits are requiring reconoitering. Market forces and China’s entry into the global resource investment sector is finding all forms of hitherto investment & planning strategies —- of all kinds —- re-evaluating new-age economic & financial analysis. We all know that China won’t budge from an investment strategy within the ambit of global colonisation that is couched in medium & long-term investment strategies. Newmont, ABX, Goldcorp, QM, RIO, BHP — all these players cannot plan & invest like China, nor can anyone, short of a return to tribalism: dictatorships controlling nation states.In view of the above, NAK, Nova Gold, etc. are small players in a much larger playing field of mining resource investment changes that are currently devolving everywhere globally. Alaskans & yes the current Alaskan government must seriously mirror Chinese strategies if their economy & State is to have a buoyant future economy. Imagine IF one of China’s Investment Corporations were one day buy Alaska’s major investors? Many Nation States are under Chinese controls, due to Chinese bailouts & Trade relationships, JV’s, etc. Alaska should reduce political influences by California or New York environmental protection group movements. IF, as the author above hints, such lobbying activity indeed steered away Quantum Minerals’ continued partnership — well, again, this is a by-product if the current dysfunctional US democratic & government experiment. US Representative democracy is an international joke today. “Feuding Democracy” is America today. Cooperative, conciliatory, concession Canada —- in contrast to the current US political process, welcomes resource investment. Ever wonder why over 70% of the world’s mining companies have offices in Canada? Ever wonder why Canada continues to enjoy “Human Development Index awards? The USA is fooling itself if it or its various bellicose leaders still believe anyone wants anything to do with the USA, not withstanding it’s miniature complex power! Yes, Canadian resource investment is endorseable. I invested in NAK & all its risks as Canadian management & culture dominates its guidance. The fundamentals are in order. The “think big” project management economic policies, though best in terms of scale economics, are fading globally in the developed nations. The USA views itself this way now, and NAK directors have responded with smaller-scale mine development. As the author suggests, the Pebble Mine Environmental / fisheries watershed Bristol Bay impact is estimated at almost none. Any further environmental group opposition to Pebble’s development would simply be still another irrational American phenomenon and further suicide to not just Alaska’s future & of course the USA. The impending US implosion, Pebble Mine opposition by irrational intransigence— well, if it continues, particularly after the Federal EPA review & acceptance (as seen after Excelsior, eastern Arizona) was given the go-ahead in August), then yes, we’ll all have to await the impending depression before Alaskans and Americans awaken to no food being ion the table. Only then, will Pebble enjoy a clear road to its normal conclusion: Development, jobs, income for all — a necessity on a planet of some 7 Billion.",
"Thanks for your view Chris,  I believe the vote from the Alaskan people shows that they want to use this great assent of theirs ,  and the no vote for the salmon shows that the majority of the fishermen are not from Alaska,  but sure poured in a lot of money  to try to stop Pebble.",

"Here's my take on FB from both an investor and a user. I was long for several years but began trading derivatives last year. I held $217.50 puts when they had their major crash in July. That was a crazy day. I was actually on vacation at a condo on the beach. Luckily I had my laptop and cashed in on the dramatic fall. One of the best calls I ever made as it sank down to about $180 (don't remember exactly where I took profits on the puts). Then I bought LEAPs, Jun 2019 $175 calls. I really thought that was a good move and didn't anticipate it declining into the 130s. I still hold these calls and hoping they come into the money as they are really not worth selling at this level. From a user perspective I see FB as today's modern-day free speech and freedom of assembly platform. I submit that a lot of this noise about privacy issues is hyperbole. Fact is that FB users are on FB BECAUSE they want to communicate their lives, interests, and events publicly. So I think the security concerns and crack down on FB may have adverse effects on our free speech and assembly constitutional rights. Today FB is more of an adult/grown up's platform, where friends and relatives exchange pictures and information about all their diverse interests (family, politics, hobbies, etc.). To overly regulate this aspect of FB is an intrusion on these constitutional freedoms. Yep, get the Russians and the evil hackers. But let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.",

A few point:- there is little to no growth in DAU in the US and Europe. - ARPU is extremely low outside of the US - ARPU in Europe is basically flat. - Human capital has been exiting FB over the last year which is a long term concern- IMO DAU in the US could begin to decline over the next couple of years. - IMO if DAU does decline in the US ARPU in the US could follow the downward move. - IMO competition in the streaming business is expected to hit up. - more and more reliance is being placed on Instagram which has lower ARPU and lower profitability. - margins are expected to compress over the near term as FB has disclosed a material ramp in costs. As a result of these and other factors, IMO there continues to be significant risk in FB. IMO investors can be patient to see if the leadership can right the ship and create the next next upward leg.",

soosstefan:   It is industry practice for MLPs to calculate distributable cash flow by deducting maintenance capex but not growth capex. To my knowledge every MLP in which I have invested over the past ten or more years has calculated DCF without taking growth capex into account.Elliot Miller,
"Mr. Fitzsimmons:    I have a position in TGEso obviously I am pleased to see a positive article about it.   However, here are some points you might want to consider when writing about TGE in the future.   1. TGE is not a corporation. It is structured as, and remains, an MLP. It has elected to be taxed as a C corporation, but its equity is in limited partnership units, not corporate shares, and its unit holders do not have the same rights vis-a-vis management as corporate shareholders have.   2. TGE has estimated that it will not have to bear a corporate tax burden for 10 years, so that the election to be taxed as a corporation did not deprive it of the tax benefits of a pass through entity.   3. TGE has also estimated that distributions received by unitholders will be approximately 90% tax deferred, so the election to be taxed as a corporation did not deprive its unitholders of the tax benefits of owning units in an MLP.   4. It is overstating the case to say that the MLP structure is out of favor. While some partnerships have converted or merged into C corporations, many of the larger and more prominent entities are retaining their partnership structure. These include, but are certainly not limited to, EPD, MMP, ET, CEQP, SMLP, DCP, WGP, USAC and many, many others.   5. It may be fashionable among Seeking Alpha authors to denigrate K-1s, but many do it because others do it, not because it  is reasonable. In fact, I find K-1s to be a very helpful analytical tool. I have a portfolio of long held MLPs, and K-1s are invaluable in my ability to keep track of my adjusted basis; knowledge of my adjusted basis is important to understanding the consequences of making a sell decision, and it is also important for my tax planning to know when my adjusted basis approaches zero.

Quit feeling sorry for the insurance companies. Many a time they have blocked better treatment for patients to save a buck. Cprx needs to price this extremely high and make a fair profit for their efforts. Than maybe other drug companies will try to find cures/better treatment or even want to compete in such areas. How many times do the big bios all make a product and compete against each other in areas where market has a huge amount of people(spending a lot of money and time) but certain illnesses have zero development or research done?  My hats are off to cprx and honestly if you want to give them bad or for making a profit or want to discourage it ... think about the big picture and “orphan drug” costs and incentives for bios to develop such products. I’m appalled at “shorts” trying to spread their negativity and make a profit.,
Pushed the wrong button... ... can not afford to pay for an orphan drug without insurance.  Is there any downside to pricing Firdapse really high besides really bad PR?,

"Just an FYIGWPH... is a UK based Pharma company. They got the 1st FDA approval for a CBD product called Epidiolex for rare seizure disorders. Apparently they charge 34k for a year supply.

I’m guessing patients in need are gonna use insurance and get the FDA product and not run to the dispensary or internet to purchase. www.fda.gov/...",
Cprx needs to price this fairly. My guess 250k/year. The revenue will help r&d to develop more effective medicines. It would be short sighted to resist progress. It’s a banner time for those affected by Lems!!!!,
Cprx went through the process of fda approval and it’ll help more patience. They are also trying to help more patience by other indications. It might be unfair to those getting for “free” but everyone has the right to be treated. This should be covered!!!! What happens if the free supply is cut off? What happens if this discourages other biotechs from developing rare disease treatments?,
Biomarin’s exclusivity in the EU expires in 2019. Prices are bound to go down from the current $60k/y/pt. Payors in the US will probably give CPRX a hard time. That would also put price/revenue potential on the label expansions (since it is the same drug). Limited M&A potential (seems to me). It is not an easy call.,

I knew that Jacobus was out there but I thought that they were completely different composition than Firdapse. Why would CPRX even want it? Why would they possibly go through all this money, time and trouble to make it? So many questions. Can Jacobus continue 3.4-DAP? And also, would love to know, about what is BioMarin charging for it in the EU and how much does it generate in sales and profit a year as there are more countries in the EU than UK, France and Germany that are mentioned in the article?TIA for any answers.",
"Hi thanks for the article.Why do you think management chose to hold a conference call two weeks after approval? I mean, I have been involved in many stocks similar to CPRX and they have had their calls the day after because management is keen to let the world know that they got approved.Do you think they are holding the CC two weeks later because they are signing a buyout or partnership? Or is it because they have no idea how to price this drug given the current political backlash on expensive drug pricing?Thanks",
"3,4-DAP is essentially the same molecule as Firdapse except for a very tiny difference in its chemical structure; Firdapse is a salt form of 3;4-DAP but their efficacy is essentially the same.FDA should not have ever allowed Catalyst to develop Firdapse as a totally new drug.This is a perfect example pharma ripping off really sick patients.I honestly hope physicians will refuse the switch patients from 3,4-DAP to Firdapse.Catalyst pharma deserves to go bust for this grossly unethical behaviour.",

"I honestly think the bulk of the economic benefit  of pumping stock price last winter was harvested by Shing illegally shorting shares against his long position from December through March using shell corporations, although that is not how I intended the word shell. I'd be willing to back down from that claim if I believed Shing was merely incompetent instead of malicious.The ""shell game"" that I am referring to involves the incessant business pivots and moving of Kankan goalposts. It is impossible to hold a man accountable for his numerous and fantastic failures when he changes the success criteria for the business every quarter. See this entry for shell game - en.wikipedia.org/... ""In practice, however, the shell game is notorious for its use by confidence tricksters who will typically rig the game using sleight of hand to move or hide the ball during play and replace it as required."" In this case the ""ball"" is the business objective and I suppose the reveal is each quarterly earnings report, where we discover that the true business objective was under a different shell.I had previously predicted that fintech likely did not exist, certainly not in the way Shing promised. He seized upon ignorant US investors salivating over a multi billion dollar market in Chinese social credit scoring and claimed he had data that he absolutely did not (Alibaba and Tencent, hilarious!) to attract additional business interest. They have the R.C. Cola of facial recognition technology. I think assuming that the disconnect between guided and realized revenues is a function of the ""complexities of revenue recognition"" is naivety or self deception.As to how Shing benefits from continuing the world's most obvious scam, he still continues to draw a salary and receive compensation in the form of stock. In this way he is able to dilute existing shareholders stake in the only potentially valuable portion of the business, the ~4% Sharecare stake. His position is too large to be liquidated in its entirety without a buyout or bankruptcy event, and I think he did not anticipate being recognized as a confidence trickster as soon as he did. Perhaps he did fail to exit any of his position in the company during its run to $15, but he will still accumulate money from this mismanagement at the expense of shareholder equity until he is indicted or flees the country. You've stated before that you are an accountant - if you took this company to any faculty member tor mentor that taught you, or any competent colleague you have worked with they would tell you it is a scam. I challenge you to approach this investment of yours with a healthy dose of skepticism and seek a set of fresh eyes on your investment thesis. Without judgement, I would be genuinely interested to hear what you are told.",
"POST LD MICRO:I can appreciate the unforeseen issues operating in a foreign country (fintech audit) and B2B deployment delays (retail/workplace) in FY18. That said, the FP&A function should have adjusted their forecast to reflect reality vs hoping they could still pull it off even with the fiscal year runway running out. Lets unravel the 50M guided at beginning of year to compare apples to apples on what actuals will be vs a forecast that is realistic. Its hard to get a clear picture of the 50M FY18 guidance made, but from what I can tell by piecing together past ER’s and comments, the 50M was comprised of 30M for fintech and 20M of “other” that would begin in Q3. Wipe the 30M out because of the lending audit, and the fact that per LD Micro call, shing said fintech is dead. Now we are at a forecast of 20M guided for FY18 of “Other”. As we stand right now through Q3, actual results are 5.6M. 3M of which was from fintech. 2.6M is from “other”. FY18 is estimated to have total KANKAN revs of 6-10M. Thus, for Fy18, 3-7M will be from “other”. In sum, the original guidance of 50M can be adjusted to exclude fintech (dead in water) to $20M guided for “other”. Actuals for “other” will come in at $3-7M. That is still a big whiff by FP&A. As “other” is the KANKAN rev stream going forward, I would like to know what caused the discrepancy between 20M guided vs 3-7M actual. Obviously, its delayed. More color on that would be appreciated because in the Q2 call, management doubled down and stated 50M COULD be attained be by a small number of the “other” installs. They claim to have tens of thousands stores locked up for deployment. Is this still true? 7-11 (11k stores) and cp lotus (how many stores?) are the only retail deployments talked about. Who are the other tens of thousand stores? How much longer are the deployments taking?What happened to food safety?How are the construction site deployments going?Lets say deployments are occurring rapidly, what hurdles is GAAP accounting is preventing MARK from recognizing revs? Rev rec is extremely complex when it comes to software. Are their contracts structured in a way that hinders the recognition?Lastly, sounds like VDC and SC are gone by end of year. That should yield a pile of cash post debt paydown. Given the unforeseen issues with KANKAN in Fy18, how confident is mgmt that the leftover cash from vdc and sc sales can last in FY19 until Kankan has its deployment tipping pint/positive cash flow/rev rec? In other words, whats their estimated FY19 monthly KK cash burn?Whats the total fully diluted share count? I estimate around 42M without employee stock options. How likely is share buyback to reward long shareholders who the company has borrowed/sold more shares against the past 2 years to keep the lights on? Clarity in the above issues would go along way in restoring investor confidence as well as the image of the company. Thank you.",

"By far, the elephant in the room is KanKan.  Remark had been claiming KanKan would take off in 2018Q3 with committed contracts.  This this did not happen.  So, the question is, was management lying or did they run into unanticipated challenges?  Also, where are they for projected cash flows considering the loan default in Q3?  Regardless of valuations, if Remark runs out of cash, they are bankrupt.  Or, if they have to sell an asset under duress, they are unlikely to get fair value for it.Finally, what is their earnings exposure to Stock Options and Warrants?  In a recent quarter (Q1?) Remark took a big hit in earnings due to the price of the stock increasing driving a Warrants liability.  Do they have significant outstanding options that will drag down earnings if the stock price recovers?Looking forward to your next article!",

"John, executives at this company have almost certainly committed some fraud. You're not wrong that the value of Sharecare + VDC - debt is probably greater than the current stock price. The only logical explanation is that market participants are pricing in mass dilution or major scandal. CFO Doug Osrow had full line of sight into $MARK's finances and sold shares at $13 before retiring. He must have known that all or most of the Kankan revenue was fictitious and he should probably spend some time in prison. They guided for $50MM in KK revs in 2018 and $150MM through 2019 using some completely made up metric around selling ""AI boxes"". The CEO went from issuing press releases to pump the stock price every week last winter to complete silence for months on end. Almost all of their claims cannot be independently verified and if you think Shing still deserves the benefit of the doubt I've got a bridge to sell you. If you want a real question to ask, ask him how many shares he will be paying himself for this disastrous year. Ask him what business Remark will pivot to being next. Ask him how he will hold himself and other executives accountable when he fails to produce financial results again next quarter.For the record, I also remember you pumping $LMFA which has also fallen over 90% since you suggested it.

"Some thoughts on Buffett, his current portfolio and recent performance:1. In his younger years as an investment manager he had spectacular returns. Now he's only somewhat above average. For instance, his return of about 11% (over the last 10 years) compares to Tepper/Apaloosa's 20%.2. The 11% doesn't include the meager returns on the cash position of over $100 billion, some of which is needed to back up BRK's insurance and re-insurance portfolio.3. BRK holds positions for tax and other reasons that make them irrelevant to most investors. For instance, BRK's 400,000,000 share position in Coca-Cola (KO) which he purchased at an average of $3.25 per share in 1988 and 1989 for a total cost of about $1.3 billion. Berkshire Hathaway receives about $624,000,000 in dividends annually from that position, for a cash return, per year, of 48%. If he was to sell the position today BRK would pay huge capital gains, which, given the dividend income, would make no sense. That doesn't mean he'd buy it again today. In fact, in 2003 at the BRK annual meeting, he said, ""Coke has high returns on capital, but incremental capital doesn’t earn anything like its current returns."" And the company earns about half as much in terms of return on capital now as it did 2003.4. Finally, take what Buffett says about investing with a grain of salt. He said for years that he'd never buy an airline stock, or a tech stock, for example. In fact he said, famously, ""The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money. Think airlines. Here a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.""-- Warren Buffett, in the 2007 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter And he said he had a guy on his payroll whose sole job was to prevent him from investing in an airline.And he was highly critical of the derivatives as an investment vehicle, once describing them as "" ""financial weapons of mass destruction."" It later turned out that BRK had several hundred million dollars invested in them. I could go on and on.I've found Munger a much more reliable guide as far as harmony between what he says and what he does.",

I was curious because Karyopharm suggests that Silinexor inhibits BCL-2, which implies to me that it is involved with transport out of the cell nucleus. Venetoclax, owned by AbbVie, is an BCL-2 inhibitor. It works very well with CLL and I take a small amount of it. But Dr. Danilov did not think that BLC-2 was active in the nucleus. On my next visit, I plan to bring him some Karyopharm literature that says it is involved and see it that stimulates any more interest in Silinexor for CLL on his part.",

It also has more competition, less proprietary technology and a c conversion in the works with a dividend that may not make it all the way.I am not trying to be a ""doggy downer,"" but let us not forget the handwriting was on the wall and Hi Crush knew it and bought out the GP at a handsome share price and stuck it to shareholders who were long the stock.

In about a week from now we will know if oil has hit bottom, and it will all be determined by what comes out of the Russia-Opec meeting in Vienna in the next couple of days.  Historical supply-demand data and oil prices show that a 1.5 MMBOPD over-supply results in a $50 price or WTI; and that a balanced supply-demand results in $75 oil.  Russia and Opec have agreed to cut, but the cut amount won't be know for a few more days.  What we do know is that Opec estimates the current oversupply to be around 1.4 MMBOPD.  Therefore, any meaningful cuts will send oil higher from here.  Bottom line is that it's too soon to know what the road conditions are ahead.

What is the delta that will be achieved for the shareholders by splitting up IBM? How much can the SOTP be worth vs the combined entity? Thanks.,

"Add Global technology service to your overall ""Services business"" and you have a consulting company worth talking about! I doubt that there will be talks about breaking anything up as IBM is taking on the RHT acquisition to help its struggling cloud business. But agree with some of the comments made that it makes sense to explore. One comment on why spin-off are more successful, doesn't that have something to do with who gets the free-cash versus all the debt, a spin-off where you would have a services business only would be heavy on salaries, but low on technology spend as R&D while you can argue that a technology business would be heavy on R&D but lower on employee costs -- does this make sense, not sure how to formulate it better right now. All in all a spin-off would require one of the company to take on current debt of IBM - not to forget the global financing IBM has.. - which is something that could work as a ""leasing company"" -- appreciate the objective comments...",
With CEO Ginny at the top of management they will continue to fail and do the wrong thing. Too slow to act and bad upper management. This stock investors should stay away from. Never buy unless they do a MSFT.,
"A spinoff into 3 divisions is possible, I've thought that is a possible direction as well.  However, its not clear how the accounting would work, since there isn't a clear delineation between systems, cloud and analytics revenue.   Some hybrid cloud runs on z, some cloud services run on z  and some z software is accounted for under analytics.  Its easy to think RedHat would end up in cloud, however linux would be systems.  They have several products that could be divided between systems and cloud depending on how you want to categorize it. I think we just have to be patient and wait to see if the IBM cloud will gain more popularity in the era of Big Data, Application portability, Cloud Security, and Analytics (AI).  I agree with others that there are synergies between on-prem, hybrid and cloud that argue against splitting up systems, cloud and services.  Spinning off GBS might be an interesting proposition, I'm sure there would be a lot of buyers out there for that business as well.  But services is also a major value proposition that IBM brings to the table and IBM invests a lot of free services to bring customers up to speed with new technologies.  In addition, without GBS, they would loose the the ability to create new services business around Blockchain, Kubernetes, Cloud, AI, Quantum etc.. having your own services business provides a competitive advantagr.  Jim Whitehurst mentioned that the value of IBM's industry reach and depth provides an opportunity to scale RedHat solutions to a level they could not support within their own company.  So he sees more growth (or, he just sees his bank account scaling and isn't paying attention to anything else he's saying!)  Additionally, while the IBM service organization is agnostic in the solutions they support, within it are services core to IBM's unique value propositions.I'm curious, with the acquisition of RHT if IBM will now be recognized as one of the innovators in Cloud?  I'm more curious as to whether this might impact (positively influence in IBM's direction) the DOD's decision for their project JEDI contract?  IBM's RedHat acquisition certainly puts them in a better position to win the DOD business; although that never came up in the press.  According to IBM the acquisition was to provide the best services for large enterprises in helping them make the leap to cloud (20% of workloads implemented on cloud today growing to 80% in 5 years) and providing them the agility to easily move workloads from on-premise to cloud and back (something that is not easy to do with AWS without support from third party tooling from vendors like purestorage).  How the world would change for IBM overnight if come May they wind up with the DOD contract, Wow!  It would certainly hail a new beginning.  But if they don't, they still stand the best chance of ending up with the majority of fortune 500 companies and large international global companies using their cloud services, or running business on the IBM cloud.  I think the comparison between IBM Cloud and AWS come down to vendor lock-in.  While AWS provides some nifty and needed utility services, you are pretty much locked and loaded in their environment once you join.  Its hard and costly to back out.  The IBM Cloud will offer standard Open Source (think the new ANSI) solutions, avoiding vendor lock-in.  While IBM will provide services to make the environment agile, secure and integrate into legacy and on-premise clouds, the workloads and data will always belong to the customer and can easily be ported.  This provides a level of risk aversion that large companies like when it comes to protecting their assets and maintaining flexibility to easily adopt new innovations into their business.  They are fee to 'move around the Cloud' so to speak!But lets not discount the DOD business.  Three months ago, AWS was the slam dunk go to winner for that contract.  At this point, maybe not so slam dunk.  If I recall, the DOD deadline for the contract had been extended.....  I wonder if the RHT acquisition will close around the same time as... no never mind.",

"As to the general topic of why is PYS trading at such a discount, the one thing I can say is that starting in the summer of 2017, PYS starting to trade with a much higher correlation to RRD stock than it ever had before and that has generally been the case ever since. Thus, despite the underlying bonds trading in a relatively stable range (for a junk bond), PYS traders seem to be more interested in what the stock is doing. Not exactly sure why, but that's the only explanation I have.",

"AT, JBK is NOT a FLOATER. It is fixed. The issuer (Lehman) went bankrupt, the counter party swaps were voided by the trust and it now just issues the fixed coupon payment of the underlying bond to the unit holders per terms of prospectus. There were lawsuits (from Lehman creditors as they were recieving the vig between spread of fixed and actual float yield) against Trust (US Bank) voiding the adjustable feature, but courts ruled in favor of trustee and issue is dead. There is no call warrant holder since Lehman went bankrupt. In fact a 3rd party offerred a voluntary tender past August at 26.50.People need to understand why the issues exist...Most of these were issued when there was no real “baby bond market”. So brokerages created baby bonds out of $1000 par bonds so the retail investor could participate in income issues. Remember the little guy largely is shut out of the bond market or were more so back them. Any that were higher quality that had call warrants were redeemed for profit by brokerages long ago. Only the crap company issues like PYS (no profit in calling an issue at par and losing money recieving the under par bonds for redemption) or quality non callables such as KTH are still around.",

"What a great and thoroughly researched article, AT.. Thanks....  have thought about your arbs recently while watching MHLD preferreds widen out dramatically vs. bonds and thinking how that one must have been very very good to you to bastardize and quote from Chico Escuela aka Garret Morris.  On PYS, the underlying is too dicey for me but what a great arb opportunity you have pointed out.  But I do wonder what RRD would actually gain by buying PYS.  They can't retire the underlying by doing so as they are non-callable other than by make whole call, so they continue to have the same debt burden if they buy PYS, right?  Accounting wise, would they be allowed to actually pay themselves the interest and capture the differential as profit?  I have no clue.   The only third party trust issue I'm involved with is GJO (Walmart) and the same phenomenon is happening there too where GJO yields 55 basis more right now than it's underlying but GJO is variable rate (LIBOR + 50, now approx 3.25%) and the underlying is a 7.55%.

I just noticed short inventory is available on the underlying bond (after none being available for months). Out of curiosity, is some of that available inventory thanks to you? Watched the bond followed the rest of high yield down in the Oct/Nov selloff, but snapped back rather quickly the past two weeks, last trade $95. Meanwhile the high yield indices are still languishing. That relative outperformance is a good sign. Have been slowly accumulating PYS here in the mid-teens. Not only should RRD be buying this, but Merrill/BofA as well. If they quietly buy shares on the open market, they have the ability to execute call warrants against them, sell the bonds and pocket the hefty differential themselves. I have a pet theory that whoever was in charge of this at Merrill (prior to the BofA takeover) has long since left the firm, and somewhere deep in their back office, a stack of dusty PYS legal documents has been passed from one clueless jr analyst to the next..",

"Whatever you're opinion, nice to see a civil discussion here. Here's hoping they have a reasonable quarter and start showing some operational success.",
"Both points of view have some validity. Every company needs to make a leverage decision and leverage always entails some risk and some interest expense. You can argue that owing $1B at low interest expense is smart but also argue the other position that if times gets worse then having the debt gone is a huge benefit to the equity. Not that different than the D/E decision in other businesses, acknowledging that the rate and maturities of fixed debt are important and also the ability to buy back at steep discounts. However, they can't buy it all back at 70 cents or even 80 cents - pure myth. They would have to negotiate repurchases with many different holders and many aren't going to settle below par. By the time they bought some in the market and negotiated the rest their average cost could very well be ABOVE par. Just not realistic at even 80 cents. Nor it is realistic as suggested that they can buy back $1B worth of stock at the current $12.50. Average cost could end up 50% higher on account of their own massive bid presence, maybe more.I would like to see them nibble at some highly discounted bonds to at least send a message to shareholders. We had much the same discussion 1 year ago about TEVA. With $32B in debt they had a bit of long maturities trading at around 70 cents. Some of us wanted them to buy back the highly discounted bonds. Sure enough, 1 year later, the long bonds principal has declined around $1B, so they did.I think there is a binary future for BBBY - either the transformation succeeds and they have a viable future business or EBIT keeps declining until they go into the red never to recover. More debt would hasten the death from interest expense and leverage worries. But cash flow wise it's not a bad idea to buy stock at $12.xx because as pointed out for each share bought back they save $.64 a year. If the future is brighter than today shareholders would benefit more by having share count reduced at very low prices than by bond buybacks. More leverage is good in a growing EBIT situation especially at low interest rates. I'd like to see them buy stock aggressively at under $14 and bonds too if they can get them at 75 cents or less. Let prices decided which of stock or bonds they buy back more aggressively.",
"If they had to buy back debt at par I agree that’s a bad idea, however the return on capital buying bonds at 70 cents on the dollar is a no brained plus it relieves the need to pay the interest.  They sold the debt for 100 cents and can now repay it at 70 cents, a 42% profit AND no need to pay the interest through 2044, no brained.  Would love to here a rationale on how buying back stock makes more sense than the discounted debt.",

Netflix CFO ""we have to become HBO before they become Netflix"". The amount of cash ATT can throw at HBO content is insane. Netflix BORROWED $8b this year for content. How is that sustainable? ATT is the sleeper stock of the decade IMO",
T just made $100 million off of Friends for one year! There is a lot more value in Time Warner than most are giving it.,
"I believe your most powerful point is…Overall company financial profile is stable; but investors will need perfect execution by management going forward for significant equity returns. $T knows that the wireless business is a commodity that will face a race to the bottom and must create new products and services capable of sustained competitive advantage.  The challenge is that in the media arena competitive advantage has thousands of products each with a short shelf life.I hope their strategy understands that Direct TV and Warner Media must become different businesses than their current state and become sources of creativity to produce content that will attract streaming customers on a granular basis to generate multiple cash flows for each offering.  Intense competition will continue to erode subscription services unless new and dynamic packages can be created to attract customers.$T does not have much time to demonstrate both the strategy and ability to execute, there is simply too much competition, and the distribution channel (networks) has greatly reduced barriers to entry in this market.",

"In the wild new world of streaming, two things are key: first mover advantage (which goes to Netflix and Amazon, they are setting the standards other competitors need to follow) and big noisy globally renowned brands that are the only thing that can cut through the confusion of Peak TV and 500 shows being made all the time. And there is where Netflix and Amazon fall short. Amazon can spend heart-attack money on buying brands like Lord of the Rings but Netflix doesn't have a ""real"" business that is bringing in money, with video as a mere sideline.Disney and AT&T are the big brand boys. That's how they can leverage their way into competition with the first-movers. If you want Star Wars, Marvel or a Game of Thrones spinoff (and they're on the way), those brands are locked behind a specific streaming service and others won't have them.HBO is a renowned brand in its own right. It's not just Game of Thrones. DC is also a powerful brand. If AT&T can't figure out how to use the big brands it bought to succeed in streaming, then they never should have gotten into a business where they are under the gun to please customers rather than just rip off and annoy them.",
"Excellent article.  This captures core concerns about AT&T's position and acquisition strategy.  While the company has recognized that the media content market is converging with mobile broadband, this article correctly sizes up the risks of acquiring the incumbent media and satellite distribution network companies.  AT&T has a history of making 'the right acquisitions at the wrong time', namely as the companies are at the peak of their growth curve before industry restructuring sets in.  The value of media companies must be weighed heavily based on their ability to move forward in the disruptive milieu of on-demand delivery.  5G is hardly at the startup stage and will not live up to all of the hype for several years.  However incremental the impact in the short-term, 5G will extend the structural shift in the media business.  This stems from two basic sets of technologies that can benefit from the approximate 10 times increase in bandwidth over 4G (due largely to the release of 100X times more higher-frequency spectra by the FCC): The 5G NR MBMS is a remake of prior MBMS, Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service.  What makes this a threat to incumbent cable and satellite services is the combination of 5G with the gigahertz of spectra that are coming available and the ability to harness that with the use of mainstream chips from Qualcomm, Intel and others. The second game-changer is the 5G NR, New Radio, Content Distribution Network, CDN.  5G NR CDN will have the most long-term impact on not just TV/movie media but all forms of content including personal and group/social media.  CDN is, to put it colloquially, 'Like putting content on steroids'.  The Internet is based on giving every point in the network an IP address.  Each content server, home/business, and user device has it's own network IP address or the sub-net address. Content is typically stored at discrete locations or on segregated distributed content networks that are accessed by the 'physical' IP address.  The content is filed under the server based on the content providers naming of it.  If you look at your browser address bar or copy a link for TV or movie content, you see the HTTP form of that addressing scheme.5G Content Distribution Network assigns a distinct address to the content itself.  That fits into the broader virtualization of wired-wireless networks so that content can be routed from a physical location that is either closest to the users or is otherwise more efficiently served up.  Other aspects of 5G create a server environment that makes it more responsive and capable of serving up media.  Furthermore, 4G-5G will enable new applications.  These include better ways for people and organizations to make use of their own content combined with 'canned' and social media content and AI, artificial intelligence such as augmented reference information search.  There is too much for the new apps space to do justice in this post.All of this furthers the gap between 'traditional content suppliers' and the 'Netflix Generation' of content development and on-demand use.  The future favors those able to harness the new platforms.  The mining of existing content and content creation is valuable but will either meet the muster of the shift or become relegated to a declining share of overall viewer participation.",

"The  comment above that GE Aero is losing ground to the two other engine manufacturers is categorically false, Further their maintenance system is by far the best in the industry, it got there by a recognition of qualified management to invest in a system that constantly perfected its computer representation of its engines( formerly referred to as digital twins) , constant modeling of operational data’s relationship to failure rates and a system that uses embedded sensors data  fed through satellites to their facility to monitor each engine in its unique operating environment. I have had first hand experience in the Pratt and Whitney version of this process and it pales in comparison to the in-place system that GE has..GE admittingly has lots of issues, but to assert the above claim is disingenuous at best and down right false at worst.

These substations will feed the first 100 MW H2V INDUSTRY production units of the Port-Jérôme factories near Le Havre (76-Normandie) and Loon Plage near Dunkirk (Dunkerque, 59-Nord). H2V INDUSTRY forecasts the creation of approximately 200 jobs at each factory site in France in 2022. According to the “Hydrogen, Scaling up” study conducted by McKinsey for the Hydrogen Council, this energy source could reduce annual CO2 emissions by around 6 metric gigatons, compared with current levels.World’s First Innovative Mass Production of Green Hydrogen Recognized as a critical contributor to the energy transition’s success, green hydrogen is the most abundant element on earth and plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Green hydrogen contains up to three times more energy per unit mass than diesel, and two and a half times more than natural gas. To address customers’ needs for green hydrogen related to the growing global trend of decarbonization, H2V INDUSTRY’s intends to establish factories in France to support Europe’s energy transition. These factories will focus on the mass production of hydrogen via the electrolysis of water, thereby delivering green hydrogen at a zero-carbon footprint.",

"GE Announces Two HA Orders and Continued Gas Power Fleet MomentumDecember 5, 2018• Orders for leading HA gas turbine booked in the third quarter in Florida and Taiwan• HA has achieved more than 220,000 operating hours in the field • Customers Invenergy and Bahrain Aluminum’s HA-power plants successfully first fired• Gas will play a vital role in a cleaner energy future according to newly announced GE Gas Power CEO Scott Strazik, keynoting today at POWER-GEN International ORLANDO – December 5, 2018 – GE today announced orders and continued strong momentum for the company’s flagship HA, the largest and most efficient gas turbine fleet in the industry, at POWER-GEN International in Orlando, Florida.The company announced it will partner with electric utility Tampa Electric (TECO), an Emera company, to modernize Big Bend Power Station in Hillsborough County, Florida, using GE’s advanced gas and steam turbine technology and services. The modernized Big Bend Power Station will help TECO produce electricity in an amount equivalent to the needs of more than 750,000 Florida households using two of GE’s industry-leading 7HA gas turbines and a comprehensive upgrade for the steam turbine island.Independent power producer Chiahui Corporation will use the HA, the industry’s most efficient heavy-duty gas turbine, as part of a full turnkey power expansion project at Chiahui Power Plant in Chiayi Province, Taiwan. GE’s 7HA.02 gas turbine will be part of the expansion to increase the plant’s generation potential, and it will be the third HA gas turbine in Taiwan, enhancing the country’s ability to generate flexible, reliable and affordable electricity from natural gas.GE’s customers have also announced major operational milestones for several HA-powered facilities around the world, including Invenergy’s Lackawanna Energy Center in Jessup, Pennsylvania, United States, and Aluminium Bahrain (Alba)’s Unit 1 at Power Station 5 in Bahrain. Both customers have achieved first fire status for the HA units —a significant milestone for plants preparing to become commercially operational and provide electricity to the grid.In addition, GE shared that its fleet of more than 30 HA gas turbines commercially operating around the world has surpassed 220,000 operating hours, and has added 19 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity worldwide. The HA remains the fastest-growing fleet of gas turbines today, with 83 orders by 35 customers in 16 countries.",
"GE Completes Europe’s First 9EMax Upgrade at Czech Power Station with Better than Expected Gas Turbine PerformanceDecember 5, 2018• GE Providing Total Plant Services Solutions for Sokolovska Uhelna's Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) Power Plant• 9EMax Upgrade Improved Power Plant’s Heat Rate, Power Output and Flexibility and Helped Lower Maintenance Costs• Modernization of the Plant, Which Uses Coal Gasification to Produce Syngas to Power Sokolovska Uhelna's Mining and Industrial Process, Was Completed within 10 WeeksBADEN, SWITZERLAND/ORLANDO, FLA.—December 5, 2018—Since its establishment nearly 25 years ago, Sokolovska Uhelna has invested heavily in upgrading its technological units. After all, it’s one of the country’s largest independent producers of electricity and the smallest brown coal mining company in the Czech Republic. Today, the company and GE (NYSE: GE) announced Europe’s first GE 9EMax gas turbine upgrade was successfully completed at Sokolovska Uhelna's power plant in Vresova, Czech Republic. GE’s combined-cycle capabilities and 9EMax’s performance exceeded expectations on heat rate, power output and unit flexibility.Sokolovska’s upgrade plans build on a rich historical tradition of mining and refining of brown coal in the Sokolov region. The company’s main products are electricity, heat, energy, coal and carbochemical products. The company extracts about 7 million tons of lignite per year, out of which, 50 percent is used for its own gasification process to produce syngas for IGCC to power its mining and industrial process as well as other power-gen customers in Europe.“Our two existing GE 9E gas turbines were reaching the end of their lifetime, and we evaluated many different scenarios,” said Mr. Homola, Production Director and Member of Board, Sokolovska Uhelna a.s. “We have worked with GE for more than 20 years, and we’re confident in the technology and trust GE’s expertise, so we turned to them to help us find the right solution. After examining both operating and capital expenditures, we determined GE’s 9EMax upgrade was the best option for our plant to improve the 9E gas turbine’s performance and flexibility as well as to lower the operation and maintenance costs for the upcoming life cycle period.”“Due to GE’s extended scope capabilities and overall excellence in execution, the 9EMax upgrade of the first unit was smoothly completed and exceeded our expectations on performance,” continued Mr. Homola. “In turn, this will allow us to be more competitive in the electricity and grid services segments in Europe.”9EMax—part of GE’s Fleet360* platform of total plant solutions—was developed utilizing GE’s deep domain experience from its global fleet of more than 700 9E gas turbines and with insights from more than 30 million hours of operating data from its installed base. It delivers significantly more power, delivering incremental revenue generation, and has a higher efficiency, which equates to millions of dollars in fuel savings. Additionally, power producers can reduce operating costs with extended planned maintenance intervals.",

"Achilles, I have generally disagreed with your articles in the past in that they were too optimistic. You generally agreed with the Immelt moves since 2015, which I considered one bad decision after another. Not completely the case with this article. I generally believe GE is oversold and the negative so called analysts are going way out of their way to highlight and exaggerate the negatives. The pension estimated present worth shortfall is a case in point. The paper reduction in this estimated shortfall  happens automatically  as the Fed raises interest rates and the numbers projected don’t account for the last two fed raises nor the fact that the 2B contribution to the pension plan is already covered by borrowed money through 2020.I don’t agree that renewables are doing well. Look at your own table. Renewable profit is practically zero in the face of substantial revenue increases, I also do not agree that healthcare should be spun off. Just in passing the idea that renewables is considered a good business while large appliances were considered non-core is reduculous. It was this inverted logic used by Immelt to make some of the worse decisions ever made. The Alstom acquisition was a poison pill and the appointment of a business leader to head power who had no previous experience in the area and a finance man compounded the problem. The oil and gas merger was another ill-.timed , and questionable move compounded by the same mistaken appointment of a business lead and the stock buy backs another decision that showed no understanding of the company’s cash flow requirements, That said , I think the new CEO has made the first concrete steps to turn power around with the announced reorganization and negotiated a clever deal in oil and gas to make the best of a bad situation,",

"GE still has significant challenges to overcome to right the ship.  The recent turbine problems have yet to be resolved, liability payments to customers, engineering, and market share loss to Solar.  As the largest segment there is no forward progress until the full impact is identified and a solid plan to overcome these.  While disposing of assets may be a way for a company to raise cash, GE faces a huge challenge here as well.  These assets have pension obligations that must be made whole as they are sold.  This will represent over $2 Billion in cash needed to complete the sales.  The biggest hurdle is trust with current, former and potential investors.  GE has demonstrated that they can’t be trusted, from Immelt’s backup private jet to cutting a dividend, to product and cash problems, GE appears to be an ongoing train wreck and the last car has yet to reach the pile up.  Until all of the shocks are known, clear paths to recovery are known and execution demonstrated that trust cannot begin to be rebuilt.

"My very wise and insightful father once asked me “For companies that do out of business, do you know why most of them fail?  They run out of money”.There’s a simple reason they run out of money – their expenses exceed their revenue.  So, if you want to stay in business, reduce your expenses, and/or increase your revenue.Culp will cut costs (expenses).  By reducing the cost to produce GE products, and by increasing the performance/value of GE products, he will increase profits.No, he won’t just wave a magic wand and reduce costs and improve product value – it takes work, at all levels of GE’s operations, from the warehouse to the factory floor to the shipping/receiving docks to product design to customer relations to supply chain management.  And more.  All levels.  Reduce the cost of operations while increasing the value of GE products.  That will yield increased profits, and increased profits will resolve a lot of GE’s problems.  It’s not complicated, but neither is it easy.  But, it can be done, and Culp knows how.  Culp ran Danaher and he did it there.  Culp was on GE's BoD, so he knows what he's getting into, and I don't think he would opt to jump into GE unless he was pretty certain he could to the job there.  It will take some time – we’ll see improvements in a few months, and at a compound rate those improvements (reduced costs, increased product value to customers) will provide the basis for growth.  I don’t know the details, but I know the broad outlines of how he’ll go about the transformation.  There are no guarantees he’ll succeed, but there’s a very good likelihood he’ll be successful.  Pay your money, take your chances.  It’s a good bet.",

Part of the Northern Region.System Strengthening 29 (NRSS 29) project, this project was awarded to Sterlite Power by the Indian Government through tariff-based competitive bidding in May 2014.  Sterlite Energy recently shared that the commissioning of the project was two months ahead of schedule despite challenging mountainous terrain. The project will provide over half a million Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) citizens access to reliable power sources year-round. The project was led by GE T&D India Limited, the listed entity of GE Power's Grid Solutions business in India. The Kashmir valley region in Northern India suffers from blackouts during the harsh winter months – leaving many families exposed to severe cold. The transmission lines spread over 400 km from Samba in Jammu to Amargarh in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district and passes through 11 major towns and districts of J&K. GE has commissioned more than four hundred 400kV GIS bays across India, but this project was the first time the company delivered a solution under harsh weather and sub-zero temperatures in India. Situated at an altitude of 1,710 mts (5,610 ft) in the snow-covered hills of Amargarh, this project was implemented in record time amidst tough conditions.",

Nothing works today maybe at lastwe have reached capitulation the  last flush on December 4 and we will move back up slowly.This country rocks and its economic growth is firing on all cylinders.What is causing the market to stutter is the famous FAANG’s.,
"I initiated a new GE position near $7.50 after selling off everything above $14-$15 after dip buys.  Current position is very small, leaving 3 more bullets to add more at lower prices - patiently eyeing near $5, $2.50 and perhaps $1 ... No rush, this is a long term play where one does not monitor the stock since highly speculative play that could go to zero.  I love it when market fears so much that it might go to zero!!  Set a fixed budget where if it goes to zero, it doesnt matter.   After Buy low then forget!  A few years from now, you’ll be glad  (or sad!)",
OK money where mouth is. Entered long 7.45 @ 18.47,
"My interest is the opportunity in the short term. The recent steep fall in price appears to be slowing and perhaps a bottom beginning to form. The chances of it bobbing about at present are greater than a decent rise taking place.

Although it is only Tuesday today, the weekly chart has negative follow through from last week's rise. The daily chart is for the short term. I bought last Wednesday and sold for a small profit yesterday, looking to re-enter only when today's decline ceases, Oops, it has just gone to 7.40, not yet then. You have referred to the RSI14 on the daily chart. It is the wrong timescale for medium/long term and in any case one indicator signal is not enough, you need other non-oscillator confirmation.",

Somehow GE reminds me big industrial conglomerate like Alcoa. Now look at Alcoa. It’s still bad. I want to feel like I am doing good on Alcoa but that hasn’t happened yet. I am out of GE partially.,
The price looks cheap and attractive. But everyone was saying it was a buy when it came below 20. Now it's below 10 and it looks like it will reach 5 soon. Looks like what happened to Citigroup and AIG.  I am starting to believe that there is no hope for GE.  I own the stock and stock a portion of it at 13.  Regret not selling all of it.  What a waste.,

I would much rather bet on BAC for a 20% return within 6 months than GE and sleep much better at night without worrying that Tulsa will wake me up with another price target downgrade.",

I'm not ready to lose my capital so fast. GE rates with Scorpio Tankers.,
"""GE deserves the benefit of the doubt.""GE does not currently get any benefit of the doubt, thus the low price.  This is deserved based on continued earnings misses, bad news and large write-offs. Additionally the stock price is temporarily held down by the mass exodus of dividend investors, higher bond yields and tax loss selling.  These situations are all temporary in my opinion.  Tax loss selling ends in December, dividend investors are probably mostly out at this point (based on avg. daily volumes) and bond yields are starting to drop.As an investor, you have to look at the situation today and going forward.  There is too much value here.  Aviation and Healthcare alone are worth the current stock price less all debts and pensions.  Power will be right sized, though it may take 12-24 months.  It has a $10 billion+ revenues per year maintenance and service business that is stable and should be quite profitable.  The real unknown is GE Capital, but even there, there is a strong captive finance company that is 70% of revenues.(Edited)",

"Interesting article. While there are many ways to value T, given its size and complexity, I believe Warren Buffett could be interested in a buyout, considering his recent comments on the general high value of all  stocks, if interest rates remain low. Following this line of reasoning the possibility exits he would favor very large equities, with very large debt balances, and matching large free cash flows. In T's case a buyout would divert the massive dividend to other free cash flow applications. Would a buyout at $45 be too large for Mr. Buffet to finance?",
Article exclusive to subscribers …. haha(and I own T at $32),
"It's ""worth"" what the market will pay you on any given day...If rates fell to zero, it would be worth $45.  If rates were to shoot higher, it would be worth $20.  In the meantime, it AIN'T worth $65-100.",
LOL ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO VALUE A COMPANY?,
"The biggest obstacle to higher share valuations for AT&T is simple uncertainty but from a plethora of sources. In the meantime we will keep adding for the Dividends and if a real Cagr emerges, going forward, the price may ultimately rise and many patient investors will finally realize the long awaited value that AT&T's dynamic business model promises.",
Read last night that at least one firm believes $T may have already lost approximately half of the $49B acquisition cost from DirectTV.  The article basically said it's better to bet and lose small like $VZ did with AOL and Yahoo than to lose big with the $180B bet $T made for Time Warner and DirectTV.,
"NO. NO. NO.ATT is NOT worth $65 to $117 per share today.That's because the market a/o 12/12/18 values it at $30.00/share. And THAT is what it is worth today.The market tells us what it is worth today and every day , not your ""analysis."".And the term ""analysis"" is used very charitably in this case.",
Is,
"I would like to see a comprehensive analysis of the debt structure involved here. $180B is a LOT of money, and if a big chunk of it is subject to market rate fluctuations, this could be a real issue going forward.",
"Nothing but people talking there book on T since it was $40.  Well, you can buy it under $30 today!",
"Not for anything, but If Buffet is using a valuation model of ""take AT&T's EPS and divide that by the long-term U.S. government bond rate.""Why doesn't he just pick the number of unicorns in the atmosphere.I'm not speaking to your use of his method @John Rhodes , just that I find it useless.Now if he were comparing the amount of debt to the long-term U.S. government bond rate, that would at least be on the same planet.And on a more serious side, the only way they'll be able to hit anywhere near $65/share is to get rid of the debt shackles they've given themselves as well as increasing subscriptions to their new services they've acquired. And to think of it at $117/share would literally ignore the past 20 years where they haven't even broken $60/share (caveat 3/19/1998 was a 2:1 stock split, which is still outside a true 20 year range).",
"Good fundamental analysis, however....ATT stock does not trade on fundamentals since they are trying to transform themselves from a stodgy old communication company to a new, revitalized media company that just happens to dabble in communications.This is the strategy behind their acqusition of DirectTV, a satelitte provider of TV services and Time Warner a multi-media company, both for many Billions of dollars. Since then, they have figured out the DirectTV satelitte business is not a good platform for their future growth, so they are attempting to become a streaming service using a box in customers homes, like everyone else.  The problem is they determined this AFTER paying about $ 15B for the asset. Not a good look from an investors perspective. They should have figured that out BEFORE they acquired them.So now comes the question, can the ATT management team actully make good on being able to digest the Time Warner acquisition successfully and unlock 100's of  billions of dollars in value to the company, or will they have their heads handed to them once again. That is the big question and a primary reason why their stock is beaten down. Let's also keep in mind that the aquisition of these media companies forced the company to take on a lot of debt, since they didn't have the cash on hand to do it without leverage. That debt comes with a lot of risk, even though a big portion of it is fixed in nature from an interest rate perspective. But it is stil debt and it must be repaid , even during a market where the US  and world economies are  most likely going to slow down considerably. In other words, the current stock price is based upon the future not historical returns, using DCF analysis. And the management team has not had a great track record in digesting acquisitions in the past. That means their projected cash flows in the future will be more heavily discounted than otherwise moght be the case, driving down the present value of those cash streams.Fundamentals may tell whether the company has a strong financial base in the present, but they don't tell you much about the future. DCF and investor sentiment is what is driving the beaten down price of ATT today.And in my opinion, I think rightfully so.And I am long ATT, but hopeful they can pull it off. The Direct TV thing has somewhat stuck in my craw, but the higher than normal dividend yield has allowed me to look past that for now.We all need to ask ourselves, why does ATT provide a higher than norrmal dividend yield at over 6%?  I beleive it has a lot to do with perceived RISK. If they didn't provide a great yield, a lot of investors would pass them by in terms of holding their stock long.Management has decided to take on increased risk for a better and brighter future ( the ""Blue sky"" concept) and the stock price has been rewarded for taking on that risk because of their past track record. It is now time for management to prove the market wrong- as it should be.I respectfully disagree with your price analysis.....",
"I have no idea how this article was approved by the editors. I conducted a discounted cash flow analysis and found the current fair value to be $34.10So, with full results for TW included over the next year, fair value is probably somewhere between $34-$40.",
AT&T sucks hugely and bad customer service is the only way they roll.   Directv and cell customer.,
If T is worth $65. How much aapl worth then?,
Their wireless franchise unfortunately is heading to third place if the Sprint/TMobile deal goes through.  Seven straight quarters of revenue decline.  From first in wireless to third in five years!,
One of Buffet's non-number ideas is to ONLY buy businesses which you understand. It is clear from the comments above that ATT is not easy to understand as the range of values presented in the original article and comments runs from $117 to zero (out of business). The parts and pieces are not really homogeneous so valuation can be a puzzle. One positive I don't see mentioned by all the doubters is that the free cash flow as reported by Morningstar supports the dividend by a comfortable margin and has for years. For me that is one thing that is easy to understand. For me the risk going forward is basically interest rate risk and what premium over bonds investors are going to demand.,
Think it will soon go below $30 again and that there will be a dividend cut sometime in 2019 that could send the share price down to $25.,
Buffet also said to discount the earnings at higher rate if they're riskier.  T is in competitive business so 3% discount rate is way too low.  Does anyone buy T and only want 3% return?  Use a realistic 7-10% discount rate and valuation is likely in 25 to 45 range.,
"Micron is a special case, though.  The only stock to earn $12 in a fiscal year with a predicted $10 to $12 in earnings the year following and it fetches a PE of 3.  Even T isn't that bad.  Goes to show you what Micron could do if it just keeps buying its shares back and then paying special dividends to shareholders who owned the stock before the date on which the special dividend is declared.",
You have to apply Micron logic here.  You can play with valuations and numbers but its not worth more than what investors are willing to pay,
"According to Yahoo, the adjusted close of T 20 years ago was 21.36, as adjusted for dividends and splits (if there were any of the latter, I don't know).  Today it is $30 plus, so there has been appreciation of $9 in that 20 year period in one's original investment of $54 20 years ago.  I assume this means that there was a $24 depreciation in share value, but a corresponding $33 in dividends.  That would give $63 in today's share price of $30 plus the $33 in dividends over the 20 year period versus the original $54 investment.  Plunk down $54 and make $9 for a compound annual growth rate of 0.77%.  Nice investment----certainly a prime candidate for garbage or trash status.",
40+ democratic candidates coming. The ad money will be flowing. Profits should boom. Buy and hold and collect your dividends. 5G on the way too with a big pie to cut up.,
Look at the price over the last 20 years.  Probably undervalued the whole time!,
Nice article John.  I hope you gain some much needed experience with the outcome of T's stock performance.  Check back in a few years and see if your double/triple present value was accurate.,
"Between the massive debt and the disaster purchase of Direct TV, I'm happy to have someone else make all that money!",
"Maybe I am missing something but surely with the acquisition of Time Warner , ATT has become a very different company . Looking at historical data is a tad pointless . Whether they become great content providers remains to be seen.  Its surely a bit like comparing Blackberry's current numbers with its past  and extrapolating out .",
"I will use this highly regarded, proven method of valuing T.  But, I warn you ahead of the result that the reasons for utilizing this method must remain secret under pain of death.T's current price of $30 is multiplied by 3, and that result is then divided by 3.  The next step is to multiply that result by 1 and the subtract 2.  T's current value is $28.  So, the market is trading T at a premium to its real value.",
"Hasn’t done anything in 8 years, it’s a better saving account than your bank, and dirt cheap but I wouldn’t expect much stock appreciation - 35 to 40, it’s a place for money to sit in to collect the dividend while you wait for something better",
"Well, after yesterday, we’re off to a good start toward $68.  Hope springs eternal!",
Has the author just come and found two tests to fit his bullish sentiment ? I sold out due to the debt. I would certainly look to re enter but I'm pretty positive this stock would do poorly under other tests such as ebit/tev.,
"John Rhodes, I like your thinking, but you need to discount your valuation (at about an 8 to 10% discount rate) to account for the time value of money. $100+ dollars over 10 years is not equal to $100+ dollars today. I do, however, think T is undervalued at current prices. Probably worth about $40 today.",
"This is some awful valuation methodology. I would venture to say that you need to learn a bit more about valuation to offer an opinion. As it stands, just the fact that your two ""methods"" used come up with a difference from each other of 80%, I would think that would raise a red flag. I guess everybody is entitled to an opinion though. HA!My own proprietary valuation model based upon the CAPM, Discount Rate Theory, Ben Graham Method, DDM, Historical Yield, and a few other factors just spit out a ""Fair"" value target of approximately $36.50.Morningstar has fair value at $37, CFRA has target price at $35, and Merrill Lynch has $37.  All of these are pretty close to each other and are rated a buy currently. But nowhere even close to what you came up with by dividing a couple of numbers and using EPS, (look at FCF instead). Google Aswath Damodoran and Ben Graham.  Good luck.",

"John, you engendered what you surely desired: commentaries and controversy.However, your argument only vouchsafes for the idea that applying what patently appears to be appropriate methodology to a circumstance that does not apply correctly leads to erroneous numbers that not only raise eyebrows, but damage one’s credibility.Sorry.I am long T, but this just isn’t applicable, i.e., “apples to apples”.  I have a feeling you know this well however.",

"Well John, I’ve been in T stock since 1971 and retired from AT&T, after 42 years, in 2013.  I really, really like your Method 1, a bit optimistic, but doable.  Your positive report has brought out a lot of meanies, with “short” tempers.  Lots of turmoil In AT&T over the years, especially 1983, when the DOJ won their monopoly case and succeeded in splitting the company into 7 Regional Bells.  Of the original split and after years of mergers, there were three survivors, Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC) Bell Atlantic and AT&T Long Distance (T).  Well, SBC bought out the struggling  AT&T and assumed the name, while Bell Atlantic patterned with Vodafone (VOD) and changed the name to Verizon (VZ).  Lots of other mergers and sales took place over the years, to get to the current T and VZ.  Verizon got hammered by Wall Street, back in 2014, when they paid $130 billion to Vodafone for their 45% stake in VZ.  This buyout created a heavy debt load for VZ, sound familiar?  VZ has survived and flourished, as will T.  I think T should throw a bone to the DOJ by offering to sell CNN, whose ratings are down 41%, due to alienating conservatives with their always negative POTUS stories.  Who knows, maybe this gesture will appease the DOJ?  At the very least T needs to put a muzzle on CNN to try to bring back the viewers and the advertising dollars that go with it.",

"The problem with the author's method, and indeed all ""intrinsic value"" methods, is that the approach is intended to value the company, not the stock. It may indeed be reasonable to value the company using DCF methods, and if the author were purchasing the company, it would certainly be important to understand the intrinsic value of the company he is purchasing. But only folks like Warren Buffet have the resources to buy the company outright, the rest of us buy a few shares of stock.Anyone who thinks they are buying a fraction of a company by purchasing stock should take their stock to the next corporate board meeting and demand a proportional vote on the agenda items. Let me know how that works out.There may be absolutely no relationship between the intrinsic value of the company and the stock price at any given time. Similarly, the intrinsic value of a company can go up, while the stock price goes down, over short, medium and long term. The argument that somehow the P/E ratio will revert to the long term mean is not supported by academic studies, it is simply an assumption.  Further, even if the P/E ratio reverts to the long term mean over some period of time, the earnings constantly change, hence the price may go down even if the P/E goes up.So there are several fundamental problems with the type of analysis presented by the author. First off, there is not necessarily any connection between stock price and company intrinsic value. Second, the intrinsic value of the company is not a well established number, it depends heavily on multiple variables which are impossible to establish. Finally, the direction of movement of the stock price depends on an auction process in the market, which is not causally connected to the author's opinion as to the intrinsic value of the underlying company. So the intrinsic value of the company may be of considerable interest to Warren Buffet, if he is thinking of buying AT&T, but may be of no interest to the marginal stock buyer, either now or in the future.",
"Price to earnings; price to cash flow; price to book, dividend yield; compare all to their historical average for the last ten or 15 years or so....That is a start. And a darn good one. I swear by (and occassionaly AT) Value Line reports. They remain positive on T and so I always have it on my short list. But it remains there, simply because a company that can't get its customer service right, probably can't get anything else right, either. If T is headed for 120, there will be plenty of opportunity to see it turning the corner along the way.Like I said to my finance students....""why are you always trying to pick a bottom? You already have one, and you've been sitting on it for thirty years.""",
I am trying to figure out which of my current holdings will double from its current prices first: ATT or BITCOIN?,
As a T shareholder I say from your mouth to God's ears. As a distressed observer of AT& T management engaged in debt fueled follies I suspect I'll see a share price of $116 around the time a fleet of flying pigs zoomed past my apartment window.,
"Thanks, I decided to unfollow you.",
From your keys to God’s ears,
I wish!,
The easiest way to calculate the worth of T is to get a quote.  It will reflect the collective wisdom of the market.The methods presented are bogus because they do not adjust for debt.,
"Certainly hoping the author is correct, Warren Buffett’s methods should have some weight given his track record but we should remember too that he rarely buys retail, usually carving himself a fat deal in exchange for a huge position, if he doesn’t just buy the company outright. He doesn’t like to invest if he doesn’t have control and that may be why he hasn’t bought into T. I believe we are in for some tough times in the market as a result of the coming storm breaking over the acting president and the criminals he has surrounded himself with. Over 30 indictments, numerous guilty pleas, convictions, a few in prison already and he is only now about to reach into the inner most circle, including the kids. T is held in many ETFs and retail investors will panic and bail out at the lows, as they usually do. Ultimately, I believe T is in a fairly recession proof business but due to ETF exposure, it may yet have another leg down. I am holding my position, enjoying the fat dividends and will look for the next great opportunity to add, which I think may be coming soon for the above reasons.",
So where is Warren regarding T? No where to be found. If it was such a great deal/valuation you would think he would be all over it.  No... I think you are confusing a going out of business sale with a good valuation.,
"When I saw the headline my first question was ""I wonder what this guy is smoking?""   You can justify anything if you have enough stats but you can not justify bad management and that is what T is suffering from.",
"I believe you are mistaken in your ""Buffet style"" calculations.Your first method is more akin to the Gordon dividend discount model. In that model, you would divide the dividend by the required rate of return. As noted by others, T is inherently more risky than the treasury rate so you would require a higher rate of return than 3%. Your second methods gets closer to a Buffet style valuation. However, Warren Buffet has said he discounts the present value of future cash flows. ""We don’t discount the future cash flows at 9% or 10%; we use the U.S. treasury rate. We try to deal with things about which we are quite certain. You can’t compensate for risk by using a high discount rate.""None of your calculations are discounting future cash flows (i.e., A $1 today is worth more than a $1 a year from now. Also, EPS is not cash flow) In addition, T today is much riskier than T in the past. The company has more debt. It has execution risk of integrating various acquisitions such as DirectTV and TWC. It's in the midst of building a 5G network. I think if you did a proper Buffet style valuation (i.e., discounted cash flow analysis with some margin of safety) you would likely reach a valuation closer to $35-$40.",
"The blue and the amber lines very well overlap over the displayed timeframe and price is tracking way below the for much of the last two years. I am sure if you reduce the timeframe by three years, the blue line will go lower, however, probably not much. Yet, as I learn from Chuck Carnevale it makes sense to play with the time frames to see if or how the normal PE varies over different spans of time.Anyway, I think plenty of evidence that T is undervalued, however, hard to believe that much undervalued.I have been long T for 3+ years, this is my first stock I bought with the intent to hold if for very long and added some recently.",
"This dividend aristocrat is not going away, your getting over 6%, yield, try getting that in a bank.  At this time T, is not overvalued.",
"I don't agree at all with the valuations, but I do agree that it's currently discounted and a good purchase.",
"John, I think your valuation is far too optimistic.  A simpler way to look at it:>The stock yields about 6.3%>Growth estimates range from 2-5 %.  Given the shrinkage of DTV, 5% seems too optimistic.  The last season of GOT is also upon us, although HBO will probably generate a new and exciting platform show.When you add say 6.3% to a middle of that growth range, you get a total of about 9%. Given the large debt and unexciting growth prospects, this is not a great bargain.  M* has the current price at 85% of FMV.  That seems more reasonable. The methods you use to compute FMV don't consider the realistic prospects and risks going forward. I am long T - it is a big investment for me - but only see a modest risk-adjusted bargain right now.That said, if they surprise everyone with rapid debt reduction and better than expected results - say with their online ad initiative - then M* may be proven conservative.

"I agree with the author, ATT is is on the leading edge of several new technologies. However there might be existential threat from Elon Musk & other companies launching LSAT’s & CubeSats to create a global network of wireless & internet service.

Direct Satellite TV seems anachronistic and clunky in comparison.",
"What an ""interesting"" 'valuation method #1'.Please apply it to any German stock right now with the German 10y yield. Or even better for Japan ;-)",
"@author: John, first of all, I deeply appreciate your soliciting honest feedback on your calculations and your reasoning. Very few authors seem to tick this way.My feedback will come out disappointing, I fear: the entire concept of coming up with a fair, an intrinsic value of a company is totally WRONG! Fraught with so many intangibles as to make it totally  worthless! I am almost sure that Buffett has recognized this ages ago; that is why he never shares with the public, EXACTLY HOW he values any company.IMHO, in return for throwing the whole concept of a supposedly intrinsic value on the waste pile of history, a true investor needs to ask himself an entirely different question: what kind of YIELDS for me can such and such a company produce?So you design a worksheet (better yet a workbook) and play into it different possible scenarios for dividend growth. PLus expected CPI as a function of time. After all, you cannot ignore inflation. And you estimate attainable capital gains, I do that on the basis of (a) increasing absolute dividends, and (b) dividend yields the market might expect in the future. So if div yield now is higher than you expect the market will demand in the future, for ATT specifically, your cap gains will be higher than those driven only by increasing dividends vs. time.IMHO, anybody who does anything other than above, is only kidding him/herself. And that includes Warren Buffett as well. Watch him supposedly ""investing"" in AAPL, with a business model resting on their (hoped for) ability, to be able to FOREVER screw their customers (by asking far too much for the products they sell them) AND to screw their suppliers also, by paying them too little. And to top it off, by believing in all seriousness, that the revenue growth of AAPL will continue like it was forever. If I ever look for silly + stupid ""investors"",  I look at who is investing in AAPL at this time.Sorry for my long rambling.",
Surely you can’t be serious ?,
"John Rhodes,As a point of interest Value Line shows eps of $4.35 and a dividend of $2.52 in 5 years.  They use a p/e ratio of 13 and a yield of 4.5%.  Using those numbers T would be selling at around $56 in 2023.  Using your 2023 numbers for eps of $4.47 and dividend of $2.48 and the same p/e and yield as Value Line the price in 2023 would be around $55-$58.  These numbers seem reasonable (they don't have to be perfect).  To get there T will have to execute on their acquisitions and get their debt under control.  We shall see.  I enjoyed reading your article.",
"I don't see the logic in assuming the next 10 years will be like the last 10. The world is changing quickly, and with 5g on the horizon and Time-Warner and a big debt load now in the mix, the only reasonable expectation I can hold is for a big increase in volatility of eps and share price.",
"$117 in 10 years is not the same as ""right now"" and secondly, comparison of T dividend to the 10 year is silly if risk is not factored in.",
It looks like you're projecting out 10 years of earnings and adding them up to get your current price.  Is that correct?  If that's correct then why have you not discounted those values back to a present value?  That's how any other annuity stream would be valued.,
"Fun exercise, but these are not reasonable valuations.  I'm cautiously entering T because I think the valuation is sufficiently suppressed such that any improvement in fundamentals will lead to significant PE expansion.Good luck investing.",
"I hope you are right, but I am quite certain these valuations are overly optimistic. Delevered T is probably worth about $60/share today. But that is a hypothetical valuation, since T does have significant debt. If several factors materialize (debt reduction, smooth integration of Time Warner, maintenance or improvement of market share across various lines of business, relative stability of interest rates) your scenarios may pan out over the next 5 - 7 years. But, that's too many moving parts. I suspect T will stay in a trading range for a while; I'd be ecstatic if it got to 50 over the next 5 years.Long T",
"Hey, I’ll take $68 for my shares no matter when, before I die.  In fact, I may even take half that right now!  I’d probably die from shock if anyone took me up on this offer! 😏",

"John,I have come to realize that the value of a stock is in the eye of the beholder.For example, Chuck Carnevale wrote an article a few months ago stating that he thought that Microsoft was overvalued by 35% to 40%.  At that time, I thought that Microsoft was only overvalued by about 2%.  And the last time I checked Microsoft, I did not think it was overvalued at all.The 2 methods you have used to determine the value of AT&T indicate that the value is between $68 and $117 right now.The way that I determine the value of a stock is by looking at the expected 5 year PEG ratio.  I would never buy a stock with an expected 5 year PEG ratio higher than 2.00.AT&T is priced at $31.70 now and has an expected 5 year PEG ratio of 1.55.  That means that if I were interested in buying AT&T at this time, the highest price that I would be willing to pay would be $40.There are many different ways to determine the fair value of a stock.  Depending on which method you use, your results will be different.",
"Coming back to earth,my model shows $36 as a possible intermediate objective for T, with 33 to 33.5 as a near term objective. The stock tends to trade off the yield number and is a slow mover.  I am long averaged to around $30.70. Little downside risk as I believe the October low will hold.With all due respect for the author's effort, FAANG like returns are not in store for this dinosaur. But I don't believe extinction is either.",
My only issue w the article is earnings projections. There will be a recession or two in there and possibly a big ugly bear market. T has a lot more parts than 20 yrs ago and when these economic downturns occur consumer’s discretionary income will fall and they will avoid things like streaming and lots of forms of entertainment. With T’s huge debt FCF will suffer. So there will be a huge discount applied to T. Me? If they keep covering that dividend and raise it a penny/qtr/yr they will keep me in there. I choose to regard T as a bond with cap gain potential. I DRIP my div and don’t plan on selling.....ever. If I sell T it will mean something horrible is going on in our country,
"We can read so many articles explaining how T is undervalued, T has even been upgraded yesterday and ... we don't see much improvement in the price. Still too many uncertainties for most of the investors. Price will go up only when investors will perceive less uncertainties. Concerning the dividend growth: If you increase the dividend by 2% every year, these 2% after 10 years actually represent around 2,39% (since the amount of the dividend is increasing every year). Keeping a ""2%"" yearly increase is therefore a more impressive performance than it first looks like.",
"If “Buffett style valuation methods” indicate T is a great buy, then why aren’t we reading about Buffett scooping up shares?  The premise of this article is a stretch.",
"Thanks for the interesting article. I got a bit excited when I saw the headline since I own 5000 shs in my retirement account at 35.22. Anyway I plan to hold T long and enjoy the ride. I think the appeal to the supremes will be positive for T and as debt is reduced the price will increase over time, but not close to your theories. Love the dividends!",
"TLDR: your article is garbagethe quality of this article is the epitome of nonsense published on seeking alpha; nobody should take advice from the author the first valuation method divides the EPS by the long term bond rate to get to fair value. The reasons are two fold; #1, a stock's cash flow is inherently significantly more risky than a US Gov't bond and therefore you demand a greater return 2-3x (or more) than that of a US Gov't bond (so while i demand a 3% return on a US Treasury, i would demand at least a 6%-9% return on a riskier asset) and #2, your valuation method would result in the non-nonsensical conclusion that the entire S&P 500 (trading at ~6-7% forward earnings yield) is trading at half of intrinsic value....So your FIRST VALUATION METHOD IS INCORRECT AS IT SYSTEMATICALLY OVERVALUES FIRMSthe second valuation method ALSO IS INCORRECT AS IT SYSTEMATICALLY OVERVALUES FIRMS because you apply a trailing twelve month p/e multiple to a forward earnings metricif you use your analytical framework to analyze stocks, i am happy because your unsophisticated people i take money away from",

"After spending 1.5 hours yesterday on hold and talking to folks who can barely speak any language & bouncing around with 4 staff about a simple billing issue, I think that ATT may be overvalued...ugh. As a shareholder, this company worries me. And I am not even talking about the financials yet.",

FANG crashed because the share prices were irrational. MSFT has a growth trajectory and real earnings. Cloud may be open technically to competition but not in practice. No CIO with a brain is going to entrust his company's security to some start-up. I expect MSFT to gain market share while enjoying superior margins. There used be a saying that no one got fired for buying from IBM. Now that is MSFT. Most companies use the MSFT ecosystem from server software to Office. Seamless operations.,
It is entirely fault that FANG stocks have dropped.  I invested in Smith & William Artificial Intelligence Fund about 3 months ago.  I'll be doubling down in a few weeks so get out of these stocks before I do...,
Good article.  Need to stop writing calls on my MSFT......,
"""This means that at recent prices, MSFT trades for just under 27 times earnings. Considering that it has just grown EPS over 30% YOY, this is a very reasonable valuation. ""What counts isn't what happend in the past but what growth MSFT sees in the future and the simple fact is: Growth is slowing down. Not only with microsoft but with many technology companies. Besides: Microsoft Corp stock PS Ratio (=7.57) is close to 10-year high of 7.91. I see red flags everywhere!I will probably never understand why the cloud business in particular should generate so much profit in the future, when there are almost no entry restrictions in the market. The much greater probability is that there will be more and more providers and that profit margins will continue to shrink. And as you always say: During a gold rush don't dig for gold, sell shovels. I would concentrate much more on the hardware for these cloud businesses, because the vendor doesn't care who he sells the hardware to. Neither Amazon nor Microsoft are involved in this area. But to be honest, it's simply the wrong time to invest in the leading companies in the field, such as Cisco or Arista Networks, they are all far too expensive. With the current prices one should not be surprised as an investor if the future return will be NEGATIVE in the next years!",

Thoughts on Zillious @TheGribbler ?,
Has the bus contract been officially announced by the State yet?When?,
"@Spin @TheGribbler, @Sunil Shah  - You three might as well be writing in Hindi.  I am not stupid, but only understood 10% of what you wrote in your posts yesterday.  Still  - it was one of the most eye-opening discussions I have ever seen on SA.Thanks for sharing your knowledge and research with us neophytes out in the audience!! It has been a painful 3 months for me, with EBIX being my largest holding and watching it fall in half.  Your insights ease my pain. Franz",
"seekingalpha.com/...Check the complexity of the Tender proposal for a 'Northern State' - crazy complex and detailed.(I believe Ebix just won Haryana Bus tender, we it's guesswork from trawling the web for Govt contracts.haryanaeprocurement.gov.in/...Ebix is going to win more states.Watch this spike hard from here.",
"""Ebix, Inc. (EBIX), a leading international supplier of On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the insurance, healthcare, financial and e-learning industries, today announced that it has been awarded the purchase order to deploy an end-to-end Bus Exchange solution for an estimated count of approximately 300 million passengers travelling annually, by Public Roadways for a key North Indian state."" I did some investigation. Haryana state, the THIRD LARGEST STATE in India, is my conjecture, from reading the govt tenders on offer.IF TRUE, this is BIG news for Ebix.The govt RFD was very complex, requiring a holistic expertise/solution in diverse and numerous fields: systems integration, staff, history, EMV and RFID proven rollouts.I TRUST THERE ARE V FEW COMPANIES IN INDIA WITH THE GAMUT OF EXPERTISE REQUIRED. IF SO, there are V FEW companies with the depth and width of resources required. Go Ebix!",
The price will rebound sooner than that. Sooner or later shorts will try to cover their position and it will move up again. Over longer term still one of the best stock s to own.,
EBIX is still in freefall. Unless RR buys a chunk and steps up the buyback to an ASR. This is bad. Could be reaching 30s.,
"On of the vocal shorts, Viceroy, is a very sketchy outift.   Ironic to see these three unqualified & dishonored individuals questioning Ebix’s & Raina’s ethics.  The founder is a disbarred UK child protection officer.www.intellidex.co.za/...",
Curious do you really think a fraud company would have a CEO take stock as a salary?,
"Buyback and RR's salary in cash !!!Been watching minute by minute trading last few days:’some large seller intentionally pushing Ebix down !  Senseless as seller could get higher price but knocks it down!! You probably know who and why, but very strange.Great decision on buyback and salary. Shows supreme confidence",
"Wow this broke down again, -7% on news that EBIX cash wins an airport contract. Thought the floor was in and now another leg lower.",
"@Spin. Your come across remarkably like hope in the wind. Like ""spin"".for a short book. Please prove me wrong...I'm listening. :)",
"@Spin. It's fallen 30% and you are ""I'm interested lower""Lol.Especially in light of your unsupported roic comments.On my watch list it was the only green share on Friday.GLTY!",
"@Manoj Madhavan , No not really - I wouldn't go short at this price.  Shorting is a tough game.   @TheGribbler made some good counter points.  We'll see if they comes to pass.RR is a non-traditional CEO and he has a history of success with EBIX 1.0.  EBIX 2.0 as RR calls it is just not something I'd buy at this price.  I'm a EBIX 1.0 kind guy - I understand EBIX 1.0.  EBIX 2.0 is a bet that RR can do it again.A debt-fulled roll-up strategy automatically puts the probability of success against you - Historically they don't work unless you have a monopoly position which the insurance exchange business has.I'd want it cheaper to take the EBIX 2.0 bet.",
@Spin.  - different question.  Would you be comfortable (in theory) with shorting EBIX at the current price (sub $50 range)?,
"@Spin. I have calculated EBIX 's real roic studiously adding back goodwill from each acquisition. Hard work! Have you, since you claim that is your rationale for a bearish view. Please share your findings.Thanks",
"@Spin.you say last month:""I don't know the answer to this - its part of my uncertainty and uncomfortable at high EV/EBITDA multiples. But I know RR said this about margins and its now 1 year on.""We have agreed ev/ebitda is v low vis a vis growth prospects., as shown above wrt op margins...So what is your problem with roic?",
"@Sunil Shah @Spin. The best way of judging ROIC, in this case, would be to consider the Indian acquisitions - hence my question above.If we could collate the number and $ amount of acquisitions they have made here over the last 3 years.Then we can estimate the revenue run rate and FCF of this portfolio investments for 2019...And value what the IPO would be, you can figure out the IRR and ROIC for the investments made.",
"@Sunil Shah , See my comments in Herman's article.",
@Spin. So if ROIC is important why don't you like Ebix today. Please explain yourself,
"@Spinof the companies you mention, I know MSFT's details. I think gross margins are close to 66% and operating margins around 34% currently..Ebix: 67% and 30.5% respectively today.And MSFT EV/EBITDA = 14.3 EBIX  EV/EBITDA = 13.1And finally, which company do you think has greater growth prospects for the next decade.I rest my case on the compelling value Ebix offers the shareholder today.",
"@Sunil Shah, I'm not sure my comments amount to 'persistent delay'.  Let's see as it unfolds in 2019.Lots of great companies have sustained 30%+ Operating margins.  SPGI, MCO, MSFT etc, etc, etc.The monopoly EBIX Insurance exchange business are like that.  Let me have that component.  You can have all the other 'multibagger' stuff.It's a function of growth, ROIC and valuation for me and confidence around the sustainability of the ROIC.",
"@Spin. thanks for input.from my reading of your comments by RR, he has maintained India IPO in 2019, now 2H.Not sure why you feel there has been a persistent delay.re op margins. well with +30% op margins historically, there is bound to be some slippage as biz grows.But how many companies do you know that maintain 30% op margins......look forward to your answer!",
The trading clouds may be lifting over EBIX as the shorts have shot their PR load over the past 2-3 weeks and are likely now covering as they cannot readily inflict any more damage.,
"Interesting points and probably the most rational detached perspective of the short arguments I've heard.- Multiple Accounting red flags high up on the income statement- Debt level pushing 4 x Debt - to EBITDA and now needing the IPO to de-lever as Debt will act as an inhibitor to future acquisitions needed for roll-up growth- Changes in revenue recognition- Underlying business deterioration- Difficulty in integrating the businesses- Skepticism of the IPOI looked at the Revenue ASC Topic 606 revenue comment.  I'm not sure that's material from the disclosures.  It does benefit EBIX though.The deterioration in the underlying business is seen with the continued Operating Margin deterioration.  The accounting red-flags is similar to my prior concerns about Software accounting changes and devices uses to protect the Operating margin.I'm not sure what the Debt-Ebitda number is where Ebix struggles to raise more debt. I don't really agree there is some inherent limit with the 4 x EBITDA number talked about.  All sorts of creative debt can be raised in low interest rate environments if there isn't a system wide credit squeeze.The skepticism around the IPO was very interesting.  So I went back through RR comments.Q4-2017 : 'Let me add that we are seriously contemplating the possibility of a public IPO for our Indian operations 12 months from now'Q2-2018 : 'Our intent is to do that, but preferably in the second part of the next year, 2019, mainly because we would like the elections play out in India'Q3-2018 : 'Lastly, we are presently planning to launch the EbixCash IPO in India possibly towards the end of 2019.'These IPO comment's sound like RR's Operating Margin comments.  It never quite gets there - Always the hope.Q2-2018 : 'second part of the next year, 2019, mainly because we would like the elections play out in India. Apparently, the elections. It's a very involved exercises in India for investment bankers. The banker telling us that it is better to do that after the elections.'I guess the rest of the IPO community didn't get the election message.www.ipowatch.in/...I'd prefer that they IPO off the pure Insurance exchange side and let everyone else have ADAM, Pets, buses, education, travel booking, taxis etc etc.",
"Email to Ebix IR sent 2 hours ago:(I'm on top of it :)) so where are the details of the price paid and the eps impact.if the price paid is immaterial, the press release should say so.RR should make  statement how this fits with the overall strategy.Please be more professional about your IRthanksin your/our best interests",
"@TexLong we are definitely on the same page. Ebix is inextricably tied to the integrity of Robin Raina.I am as sure (as one can be in this murky world with psychopaths) that he is a man of integrity and virtue. I conclude that from the previous smear campaigns on RR, and on Ebix coming out unblemished from the malicious multiple attacks and SEC investigation.My only major conundrum is this Indian Auditor for '18 move. I'm sure there are valid rational reasons (not divulged hence it makes no sense), and those reasons are - in my careful analysis - tied to impropriety of biz vendors. I deduce that from the fact that both founder groups of major buys, ITZ and viacom have subsequetly left Ebix. There is definitely something murky here, probably linked to tax man and the purchased businesses. But I'm confident, however it pans out (and it WILL BE revealed), the liability will fall primarily on biz vendors not Ebix.Looks like the market today (ebix up on rising OBV on red day) is coming to the same conclusion.",
"I have to admit, EBIX was the gem in my portfolio. Think my annualized return was 60% over 3 years up to mid 2018.",
"On the current VC valuations imputed on infotech Indian companies a P/S ratio of 4-8 is entirely possible on IPO listing. Given the projected annualised run rate of Ebix India ($400m by 2019), that amounts to between $1.6 - 3.2 bn.And Ebix india is profitable, whereas most IT Indian Unicorns are NOT.And let's see the ENTIRE market cap of Ebix, including about $90m of recurring profit from EBIX USA is now $1.42 Bn.IMO Shorting Ebix now is a pretty unequivocal way to ruin currently.",
"I understand that shorts thrive on fear and misdirection.  I don't know much about Viceroy, but how could anyone take this analysis seriously?  Could it possibly be more amateurish, poorly researched, outdated, or one-sided?  The slides also look like they were pieced together by a high school student cutting and pasting.  What serious analysis would cite discredited Gotham and Copperfield articles from several years ago on the very first slide?  And, as pointed out by The Protagonist, why use a couple of dinky old acquisitions to make your argument?EBIX has been an international company for many years.  Is it surprising that they structure their  international business to minimize taxes?  All good companies do this, and it is not illegal.   Even Buffett does his best to minimize taxes in his businesses, even if he occasionally pontificates that wealthy individuals should pay more.Vicreoy repeatedly posts there may be a possible ongoing DOJ investigation when there is no proof of such.  This is a blatant fear tactic used to cover the lack of a substantive evaluation, and scare the casual investor who may not take the time to understand this company (like Viceroy itself).  Likewise, the presentation repeatedly references MiMedx - a company that does not represent EBIX in any form or fashion.  Viceroy also mentions scary Deutsche bank raids which have zero bearing on EBIX.With respect to regulatory issues, there simply are none since 2013.  In 2017, the SEC did not recommend any enforcement actions against the company.  A respectable analyst with a valid argument would not need to insinuate impropriety when there is no evidence.  And ""roll up"" tech structures (the favorite short phrase) are not under increased scrutiny.  Growth via acquisitions is not easy, but it's completely legal and a time honored strategy (e.g. Middleby).  And EBIX is much better than most companies at growth via acquisition.  There is almost 20 years of history to prove this.Why ignore the PPL success in London, and the fact that Lloyds is now considering using EBIX's technology in SE Asia?  That hardly sounds like proof that the legacy insurance exchange is dying, or EBIX ""changed"" its business model.  I would argue that they are building upon the current business model and using two decades of experience to create EBIX 2.0.  This amateurish report also claims that there are no potential synergies between the legacy insurance exchange business and the recent expansion into India fintech.  There are hundreds of potential ways in which to cross-sell and build a very potent ecosystem.  Why not mention the BSE venture?  Or Forex services like those provided to Paytm in which Berkshire Hathaway has invested?  EBIX's legacy business is in managing and streamlining transactions.  How could Viceroy claim that management has no experience in financial transactions?There is also no mention that the company has publicly stated that it will be hiring a Big 4 auditor by FY 2019 1st qtr.Other issues that argue against impropriety are also conveniently ignored by Viceroy:- The company has retired about 25% of its shares in the past several years.  How did they pay for these buybacks?  With phantom money since they don't have real FCF?- Why does Raina own over 10% of shares and rarely sell if this is a house of cards getting ready to collapse?  You generally see plenty of stock sales among crooked CEO's or in businesses on the verge of collapse.I also had to laugh that the last slide shows Raina with his Ferrari California - a car that anyone can buy used for about $150,000.  Heaven forbid that a CEO owns such an outlandishly expensive car!  Maybe, Viceroy doesn't know that you can spend much more on a Mercedes?One thing I'll credit in this report is the ""Devil's Advocate - Risks"" slide.   EBIX has already ""started performing"" and its FCF and possible India IPO will certainly allow it to pay down debt - pretty rapidly actually.  It also has a stellar history of share buybacks as mentioned above.Last point:  the current valuation is incredibly compelling for a value investor - especially for a tech stock with a proven earnings and cash flow history and long duration, committed CEO with significant skin in the game.  India is also a tremendously promising growth story, and I'm very happy to see EBIX making a strong move there.Disclaimer:  LONG on EBIX since 2008",
"viceroyresearch.files.wordpress.com/...That's the viceroy presentation.They have valid points. But the issue I have is they are criticizing small acquisitions of $10-20M (and respective goodwill) from 2013-2015.EBIX's acquisitions the last 3 years have been much larger and amount to 30-50% of revenue because of the India operations.The other thing I don't get, is the fact they reference paying down debt as a risk. This implies they have good FCF....so why would you short it?Nowhere do they do a valuation and price target either. is EBIX worth $0 as a fraud? by their accusations...",

So the thesis  has legs.However, at $50. and $3.5 in EPS. We are P/e of 14...So you can ignore growth to an extent. It's at fair value so how much downside is he expecting?But in reality, an India IPO. will give EBIX cash to either eliminate debt or make further acquisitions....I thining India operations should grow at 10-15% a year organically.RR owns I think 10% of the company right? Why would he destroy his entire net worth at multi year career at this point....The change in auditor was bad, but EBIX stock already got punished for it...We still have $200M buyback which is 15% market cap.So if the business FCF is real, then i don't see how this company is a short at $50.

Right now we are buying again.Basic insurance exchange businesses are rock solid with near 100% highly profitable recurring revenues--huge cash machine.

Biggest threat there is the continuing problems with the banking system--which unless dire, should not impact EBIX anyway.My only concern is their need to fix the material accounting weaknesses first cited 115-8+ months ago.As happened when the stock ran for 4+ years from the teens up to the 80's, the shorts will get slammed in the near future.

"-The ignorance of what Ebix is doing in India demonstrated by the interviewee is staggering.-The rollup strategy and questions asked - and resolved by the SEC ('no further questions pending')  from 2015 - are brought up as another 'red flag'.... whilst his short trigger is a period of 3-6 months. LOL!-he says India unit IPO was 'forced' onto EBIX and the Indian assets are weak. Both blatant lies: if you look at the VC valuations of India companies (or what Walmart just paid for Flipkart on P/S or P/BK ratios) this guy's opinions belong to a Bollywood comedy.-the only point that I agree with is the 2018 Indian Auditor which opens a window to 'grease' potential problems/accounting irregularities without much resistance. BUT if Ebix did indeed need this window, it may have been due to pleas from vendors of Companies Ebix bought in 2018 in India (who had to evade the tax man on the value of biz they sold to Ebix, as it was under-reporting rev on profits on acquisition) . It is NOT a FACT or even a material probability that EBIX has impropriety to gloss over.-And most importantly a BIG 4 auditor will be approved by 1q 2019...that gives the short investor (30% !! of float shorted) about 4 months to flee.-LOVE IT!

All this short noise does not change the underlying profitability or growth of the business. I trust management’s judgement and track record more than ————.,
"I have been long EBIX for years, back when the GS deal fell through and they dropped from $20 to $10.  It has been a favorite of shorts many times, at one point being the most heavily shorted stock on the NASDAQ.  They may push it short in the mid-term, but long-term EBIX is a cash-generating machine with high margins.  RR has a proven track record of successfully integrating strategic acquisitions.  The shift from insurance to a predominantly India-based payments company has caused a lot of uncertainty, but virtually everything they have purchased has been accretiative to earnings.  I am long and continue to be long.  It is one of the few direct stocks I still own these days, and I bought more recently.",

"It is completely weird to me that (to my knowledge) zero of the sell-side analysts covering CLF take into account CLF's hidden domestic tax asset worth almost  $3 share.  Analyst's historical EV/EBITDA multiple analysis completely misses this, never mind the fact that each unit of  EBITDA is (all else equal) is worth more given a lower corporate tax rate (so historicals don't make sense).   Absent a massive recession, CLF stock has gone from cheap to sickeningly cheap.

I think CLF is becoming a limited liability company or something similar with all of these liability exercises.  Management seems to want to own the infrastructure and will market the product but does not want to own the manufacturing.,

For this reason and given demand factors , I say the 8-handle on CLF now gets my attention but $8.00 would be a safe re-entry point unless China tariffs come off and commodity demand weakens further.  We are seeing increasing short interest while LG talks share buy-back and this suggests there is much we don't know about a hidden minefield.",

Just thinking out loud on a Friday night.  If the new Toledo plant works out CLF will become a vertically integrated iron ore company.  I think it could spin off that plant along with any other HBI plants convert them into an iron value-added MLP.  I think that would be a very interesting investment.  It is like MSB 2.0.  Where as MSB owns the land the iron is in the HBI plants own the concentrated metal.  I mean the future HBI division will have stable in put costs and sell products under stable contracts.  The MLP aspect would be very interesting.CLF would be in operate the pellet plants and the new MLP operates the metallics plants.  I already thought of the ticker symbol HBI.,

"Cliffs asks judge to evict rival from land, modify permitCleveland-Cliffs is asking a state judge to evict Mesabi Metallics from parts of the former Essar Steel Minnesota project, while also forcing the state to amend permits in order to exclude activity by Mesabi on Cliffs-owned land within the Nashwauk project.Cliffs submitted an amended civil complaint late last month to Ramsey County Court seeking to clear the way for the company to begin its own mining operations at the site, which features a hodgepodge of land and minerals owned separately by Cliffs, Mesabi and the state of Minnesota, as well as patches of land co-owned by Cliffs and Mesabi.In May, and again in July, Cliffs asked the state Department of Natural Resources to amend the Mesabi permit to mine, citing the Cleveland-based company’s December 2017 purchase and lease of more than 1.1 billion tons of minerals in Nashwauk.That purchase was upheld on July 23 by a federal bankruptcy judge overseeing the original Essar Steel Minnesota filing.If an amended permit to mine is not ordered, Cliffs argues it would be a “barrier” to any plans of mining the site, citing the current permit and saying it will not let Mesabi mine on Cliffs-controlled property.“If the Permit to Mine is not modified to remove the [Cliffs] Properties, [Cliffs] will be forced to spend millions of dollars attempting to obtain a permit for properties on which another party already possesses a State permit to conduct mining operations,” the company wrote in the filing,” a substantial risk that no reasonable business would or should be willing to incur.”But the amended permit to mine is only half of the company’s request. It is also asking the judge to order Mesabi Metallics property and operations off the land, which could hold big impacts for the fledgling mining company.Prior to last December, Mesabi Metallics held a lease agreement with Glacier Park Iron Ore Properties for the land in question, but after failing to make payments in October, GPIOP cancelled the lease and negotiated with Cliffs.In August, Cliffs served Mesabi with a no trespassing notice, asking the company to remove itself from the land, which includes the mine’s tailings pipeline that runs between the basin and Sullivan Pit, as well as water appropriation pipelines.An order kicking Mesabi completely off the land could result in the need to spend millions to replace and reroute the lines.The filing is just another round of a long-standing feud between Cliffs and the company in control of the Nashwauk property, dating back to Essar, which filed for bankruptcy on the project in July 2016. Mesabi Metallics won the bankruptcy bid over Cliffs in 2017.After a number of extensions granted by the state to finalize funding requirements, Mesabi Metallics has said it hopes to ramp up construction in March, facing a looming Dec. 31, 2019 deadline to complete the half-built pellet plant. The company also faces a Dec. 31 deadline this year to begin construction on a value-added facility, per terms of a mineral lease agreement with the state.A spokesperson for Mesabi Metallics said the company is in regular communication with the state, providing an update to Minnesota and Iron Range leaders last month.The company has also reached out to Gov.-elect Tim Walz, who may face a decision on the project’s state leases in the first year of his four-year term, provided the conditions are unmet and an extension is not granted by current Gov. Mark Dayton before he exits office in January.www.virginiamn.com/...",

"One thing I have noticed is that many otherwise knowledgable investors who first look at the stock make the assumption that the incredibly favorable steel prices must be factored in to the current price, and therefor it is set for a fall on any (In my view healthy) correction in steel prices.  This is far from true.  Even at the recent peak CLF was not factoring in continuous +800 steel prices.  Indeed, such a level might prove unhealthy for CLF over time, as it could discourage steel use and eventually would increase the call to remove dumping protections for the domestic industry.   For such a simple business, it is remarkable how resistant analysts and investors are to taking the time to learning even the basics of this business.  I think that perhaps this is just how it is with out of favor sectors - as if there is an invisible wall in front of peoples faces preventing them from using their heads.",

It is going to come out of this semi-funk way faster than in the past. The buy back and the dividend are great backstops.  Never mind that they are loaded out with cash and going to be filling up the bank again this quarter.,
"EPS estimate for 2019 in the table is more than 20 % lower than for 2018. I understand that iron ore and steel prices are expected to be lower while pellet premiums are expected to be higher. If that 20 % EPS reduction would come true, should 2018 be considered a peak (adjusted) earnings year before the effects of HBI? And is HBI going to considerably reduce earnings cyclicality, and what HBI volumes would be required for this? What are average forward P/Es for cyclical miners, if avg P/E makes sense at all here?",
Vlad - I am very concerned about CLF's debt/equity ratio. Indeed its equity is a negative number (ca. minus $86 million). Admittedly the equity is becoming less negative with time. Nevertheless the risks of investing in a company with negative equity must suppress the share price.  The impact gets worse as interest rates increase.,

"I still have shares purchased at $14 in 2014. But I also have shares purchased at $2, $3, $4, $6, $8, etc...It is perfectly reasonable to suggest that they make $2.50 next year. But what will their multiple be? At some point, WS will decide the stock needs to go higher and it will. Us small people, however, can only sit on our investment and wait for that time. Ultimately, I see 225 million shares outstanding and $1 billion / year profit for eps of $4. I cannot determine WS multiple. However, I do foresee dividend of $1/year down the road, especially once they're done building HBI plants (will wind up with at least 2, maybe 3). As an investor, not a trader, I have time",

Furthermore, the market will become so efficient that no retail investor stands a chance against institutional investors (my college finance professors will be proud). P.S. my data/assumptions are derived from ADNT's most recent 10K filling and earnings transcript. I use a range of values rather than a single price target as valuation is an imprecise art, and there are different scenarios where ADNT's share price may fall in the foreseeable future. All I know is at its current share price, ADNT's upside potential far exceeds its downside risk, which makes it a worthwhile investment.",
"ADNT's Seating and SS&M joint ventures are worth at least $24/share based on 10x equity income x 70% cash conversion. These joint ventures have been growing steadily in the past three years and are not affected by ADNT's operational difficulties. SS&M and YFAI's assets are worth approximately $15/ share assuming those assets have no reproductive value going forward. Seating as a standalone segment is generating 29% ROIC (EBIT/Invested capital) and is worth at least $25/share after deducting all firm level's debts and pension liabilities. Additionally, dividend suspension is a rational, maybe one of the best decisions the management has made, given the level of CapEx and debt repayments facing the company in the foreseeable future. It makes no sense to pay dividends back to shareholders when cash can be effectively used to rehabilitate operations and optimize working capital, which in turn, will deliver much greater value to shareholders through capital appreciation. On the contrary, dividend suspension has created lucrative buying opportunities as institutional buyers are forced to sell due to portfolio mandates and yearend window dressing.  All in all, in the worst scenario where SS&M and YFAI losses continue to erode asset value & Joint ventures fail to deliver, ADNT is worth at least $25 per share. I would praise your short thesis if it was posted 12 months ago. But the timing of your article reminds me to be greedy when others are fearful, and I counter your $19/share price target with a $40 - $64 price target in one year.",

On a per share basis the adjustment would be $35.23/share. Since the Sherlock Debt Divisor includes long term debt, one might choose to adjust for Long Term marketable securities.

WS analysts seem to find a way to release a story that hammers a share price and the network seems to blast away on every segment on television resulting in the stock price getting slammed.  The, IMO, the street firm either establishes or increases a Long position or loads up on Call buying after 'the dump' has worked.  Wait a couple of weeks and, POW, there's reasons being floated to be bullish on those shares.  IMO AAPL has been a recent example of this manipulation (which has worked for decades).Meanwhile, the SEC sits there and sets there and sits there seemingly oblivious to what's what.....That's my view.  Again, I think that this Article was worthwhile and accurate in an academic environment.  Wall Street has its own methodology of increasing or decreasing share prices, unfortunately.",

The right timing for the SHORT was June 2018, with BABA around $200.  We closed that SHORT around $135.  Now we are waiting for the next ""3"" signal, which saYS SHORT AGAIN.I guess I don't know what you mean by ""any which way but loose"".  You are apparently LONG BABA because of fundamentals.  Fundamentals tell one how the business is doing, not how the stock market is doing.  There is an implied causation there, an assumption that stronger earnings will result in higher prices.  But this is NOT a causal relationship.  Higher earnings do not cause the stock price to appreciate.  More BUYERS cause the stock to appreciate.  Higher earnings may cause more buyers to come in to the market -- and they may not.I have been crafting my system since the 1987 CRASH, with a lot of failures along the way.

"I guess GM didn’t almost go bankrupt during the 2008 2009 crisis. The difference between that company and GE is that the government actually loaned it 10’s of billions which it never got completely back to the tune of some 11 B. If the government were willing to give GE 11B or so, it would be very helpful. I’m being cynical. As far as I can remember, the crisis then was created by overleveraged real estate loans, not sufficiently backed by assets. In order to hedge these loans financial institutions created securities backed by baskets of these loans where the baskets contained a mixture of well backed loans and risky ones. This process then was leveraged by creating combinations of these securities into another set of paper securities with higher yields, in some cases this  was repeated another time. The selling of these securities removed several time from the tangible assets yielded tremendous incomes for those creating and selling the paper. I wrote at the time that this had become a colossal Ponzi scheme based on greed and was bound to collapse. SE what’s your reason for the 2008,9 debacle.",

"Romanvvv, you are way behind if you just got the news about the pension shortfall. Further this number is the present worth estimate of the liabilities. Two things you should know is that GE borrowed 6B to cover a 2B a year payment to the pension fund for three years. Secondly, that estimate will be at least two raises of the fed funds rate behind if the fed raises rates another quarter point in Dececember. This will reduce the estimated shortfall by about .5B. If that rate is raised between one and four times next year, that estimate will reduce an estimated 2,4 B/ quarter point raise. I believe the pension shortfall is way over hyped.SE you still can’t use current yield on bonds as evidence of that so called run. You must know that. Unless the short term lenders have a contractual provision that calls for immediate repayment, GE need not repay it until is loan comes due. Do you have evidence that the short term lenders can demand loan repayment immediately? If so, how much is involved?.",

"Shock,I think you are crying wolf about GE going into BK.   In 2017 and 2018 GE has acknowledged that write off were required in several segments of GE Capital.  After all the adjustments, GE Capital still has $11 billion+ in equity per your balance sheet stated in this article.  Second, the above balance sheet shows $47 billion in cash and short securities.  If applied 100% towards debt, that would leave $23 billion in net debt.  Over the next 17 years, I an confident that GE Capital is capable of handling this debt load.  Third, you are implying any new loans financed by GE customers will be at the same low rates as provided in the past.  If GE did this I would agree that it would be financial suicide.  However, I believe GE is smart enough to have a net positive spread between their finance cost and interest income from projects financed.  Fourth, you are stating that GE has been shut out of paper market.  I think it is more of a recognition that they recognize rates are rising and prefer to secure lower cost financing now over a longer period time and recoup these expenses at a later date as interest rates continue to increase over the next few years.  As stated in this and numerous previous articles, the 800 pound gorilla for GE is their power segment.  Over the last year, Flannery has did a good job in correcting the mistakes made by his predecessor.   Assuming Culp works his magic like he did at PH, GE Power should be near cash flow neutral in 2019 and capable of having explosive earnings at the beginning of the next uptick in the business cycle. With most of the heavy lifting done and continuing on their path of correcting their business shortfalls, GE should be prepared for the next economic downturn and ready to explode into the next upturn.At this point in time, I feel that GE is at or near their lows moving forward.  With a 15 year investment horizon, I am taking advantage of acquiring shares at the current low price.",

"SE, I don’t understand your table. GE is only obligated to pay the coupon interest rate. Yield is not a cash flow measure. Obviously if the bonds can be bought on the open market at less than face value the yield is higher. Why would you refer to the yield as representing a need for more cash? The replacement of bonds coming due is another issue and if borrowings are required to replace them , whatever the increased interest must be paid at that point. Using current yield to assert that that is the the increased cost that somehow represents a run on the bank is a little disingenuous. Further, the points Jeremy Blum makes are valid as far as I can see. I will say this, however, it would behoove current management to address in very understandable terms the nature of GE capital’s debt and the time related requirements for dealing with the sequential payment due dates, the expected interest that schedule will require and the total time related cash flow of the expected sequence.

If we go into recession, some of that will be legit.  However, GE is more recession resistant than most.  Aircraft, which is worth at least half the whole company has a backlog which will go right through any recession.

"@Matt Bohlsen estimated 1m tonnes of off-exchange stockpiles.?????????????Source TD securities“Despite the dreadful performance over the past six months, nickel remains a darling in the eyes of the press and among many analysts as deficits and electric vehicle demand expectations keep the talk focused sharply on pending supply shortages. But, speculative investors across the LME, systematic strategies and Chinese hedge funds have all firmly taken the other side of that bet, driving prices some $5000/t off the June highs, and showinglittle sign of recovery as the majority of its base metal peers have.Indeed, as trade war worries between the US-China kicked off again, base metals including nickel promptly sold off. But, in recent months, headlines of constructive talks between Trump and Xi have prompted traders to cover shorts in metals with stronger underlying fundamentals such as copper and zinc, but this was not the case in nickel. Speculative money has remained firmly against nickel and TD Securities tends to see the nickel story inthe same light, as we had previously recommended shorting the metal in June at prices north of $15,000/t.For now, we remain bearish and think that further downside is possible as the trade wars concerns linger, but do not see an asymmetry in risks that warrants putting on a short position at current levels.On the fundamental side, LME and SHFE stockpiles have certainly been drawing down, but there still remains a sizeable portion of inventories, especially taking into account the estimated 1m tonnes of off-exchange stockpiles.Meanwhile, despite the fact that a portion of export permits were temporarily revoked due to a failure to meet smelting capacity requirements, Indonesian ore exports have been steadily increasing and we expect will continue to grow as permits allow for tonnage similar to pre-ban levels. In addition, after a rainy season, and after restrictions on previously banned mines have been lifted, ore shipments should also increase out of the Philippines. These sources of near-term supply will very likely be met with temporarily lower demand as trade war and global growth concerns, along with slumping stainless steel prices weigh. As such we would not be surprised to see nickel trade as low as $10,000/t in the early months of the year if trade sentiment worsens.In the latter half of the year though we do expect a trade deal to be struck and base metals to recover, which should also see nickel prices move higher as well. But, unlike the hurdles that some other industrial metals might face, nickel demand also faces longer term challenges which could see forecasts move sustainably lower. Indeed, longer term bullish outlooks are focused on the need for nickel as an input for electric vehicle batteries. This outlook is built on already shaky ground as battery technology could very well change before that demand actually materializes, but an even bigger risk looms if Tsingshan is able to successfully and economically produce HPAL nickel”",

"Smart work here -- though I'm with you on derivatives, I'm still bearish on DB mainly due to ethical and regulatory concerns.",
"In the old days traders had to take two weeks holidays each year in part to see if any ""problems"" emerge. I suspect DB's derivatives book is sufficiently complex that that quaint old tradition is pointless. I used to observe that the whole business had a flaw , the books mark to market is done by the very trader whose has an interest in maxmising the profit for his bonus which once cashed you cant get back , at least not in the old days. So there is an obvious temptation to tweak some of the assumptions used to generate the value of the assets . If the book is such a concern to management  why not ask the traders to liquidate the book. I assume they will be give management a whole bunch of reasons why they cant , the simple truth maybe  there is no buyer of the risk at the mark. Now perhaps this no longer happens but one of the more laughable things that could happen is once a real big problem is identified it goes to a special back book that ""management""  who have no experience of risk taking takes over and you see group think trading in action. The point of my comments is history suggests there are few ""great"" traders or risk takers . You have in banks a bunch of guys and girls playing with shareholders money where there is an incentive to take risk which if it pays off leads to a big bonus , if not the worst that happens is one gets fired and often moves on to another bank. If the derivatives book is growing in size that may suggest an underlying problem. I wonder how often the book is turned over which would really show if there is a problem. Does DB show that ? A low turn over rate is a pretty big red flag. Last observation is the derivatives world is very complex which attracts very smart people . These guys and girls are really smart. Such people often make awful risk takers . Risk taking as everyone here no doubt has learnt requires a humble attitude and acceptance that one may be wrong and cut ones losses. Super smart people tend not to be like that . Bottom line i think is DB is impossible for an outsider to value  , so it may be a great buy but one should have a stop in and see it as a spec trade . After all using traditional values one might have loaded up when it became dirt cheap at tangible book .",

I worked at both and DB staff is overpaid and interested only in having the highest possible bonus, which is not the case at BNP Paribas, where there is a strong risk culture.

"@Paulo Santos I enjoyed the article and it brings up many valid points.  Big numbers are only scary when people don't know what they mean. However.  (I copy this directly from my CFA textbook).  - VaR is a minimum loss. This point cannot be emphasized enough. VaR is often mistakenly assumed to represent how much one can lose. If the question is, “how much can one lose?” there is only one answer: the entire portfolio. In a €400 million portfolio, assuming no leverage, the most one can lose is €400 million.- A VaR statement references a time horizon: losses that would be expected to occur over a given period of time. In this example, that period of time is one day. (If VaR is measured on a daily basis, and a typical month has 20–22 business days, then 5% of the days equates to about one day per month.)",

"Derivatives, or bond insurance, does exist in this environment. In an honest monetary system, it should not and would not. The reason it exists is because the US dollar denominated world's reserve currency system (aka: Shadow Banking) is a totally credit based system, so credit risk is allowed to go exponential, never ending, just being constantly turned over again and again. There is no debt extinguisher in this type of system, so credit will run until the entire system collapses and it will collapse.",

This time of year I start looking at the new 52 week lows for tax loss BUYs. I have been amazed at how many investment grade preferreds and exchange trade debt are hitting lows.

"the author being a DB bull just might have a somewhat benign view of derivatives. a while ago i had read that Total Global Derivatives market is about $700 TRILLION. now i do not know what the ""margin"" is on that number (even if that $700 T number is ""exaggerated it dwarfs Global GDP). Global GDP being around $80 Trillion .the risk is counter party risk -- and volatility, and declining credit quality and changing fundamentals alter the equation. i have noted that there has been a bull market going on in Credit Default Swaps. just to mention one ""patient"" -- GE. someone owns every penny of GE's approximately $110 Billion of now near junk debt, plus the there is an underfunded pension liability of $30 Billion. three years ago GE had a AAA rating. there has not been a default but there has been lots pain owning this paper. GE CDS's have been in a bull market. i think i can state with impunity that all derivatives CONTRACTS are not created equal. the price action of DB's stock has been in the ICU for some time. everyone knows DB has a huge derivatives book and seems to somehow be involved in every can of financial worms out there.  there is a reason the stock trades in single digits. to quote Warren Buffett: ""derivatives are the weapons of mass destruction in the financial system."" financial leverage is a wonderful thing --- it just depends on where the fulcrum is placed. right now the global financial system is leveraged up pretty good! the skunk in the woodpile is De-Leveraging at a time of rising rates and slowing growth. ask GE how that feels? particularly after repurchasing millions of dump truck loads of their shares at much much much much higher prices. and .....

"This is a very, very good and well-argued piece and I commend @Paulo Santos on it. It's nice to have a well-argued counter-point to the many articles that abound about Deutsche Bank's woes in most mainstream business media and beyond.But in fairness, I still see many, many clouds on the horizon for Deutsche, none of which are addressed in Paulo's piece. My two primary issues with the bank, which I think materially will make waves in the near future:1) Heavy alleged exposure to the massive Danske Bank money-laundering scandal in Estonia. Any potential ensuing fines here could be in the stratospheric class, and not only for the Danish bank...2) Heavy exposure both to the Trump family and to assorted Eastern European interests in potential scandals somewhat mirroring (1) above. Robert Mueller and his team are allegedly taking a keen interest in Deutsche Bank, and it is rumoured that the German law enforcement raid on the bank this week was connected to specific US requests.For my part, I would stay away at least until the above issues become resolved or at least become clearer. At the moment they're semi-known unknowns. Other people may well draw other conclusions and make different investment decisions. I'm not advising anybody to any specific course at all, just making decisions for myself.Anyway, apart from the above issues (which other people may not think very serious), I think Paulo's piece is exemplary and deals with the derivates myth in general very effectively.",

"Since SQ is a growth stock, it is not meaningful to look at valuation based on earnings. P/S gives a much better idea, which is the same for SQ,V,MA; but if momentum (growth) is reflected (near 50% vs 11% growth) -- then it is clear SQ is much-much cheaper, than V or MA: PSG (P/S per growth) is less then 1/4 !!!But if bear-market is imminent, all that will not matter for long time to come.

"Folks should BUY MU and NXPI. Chinese President said he would be open to personally looking into Failed QCOM/NXPI Merger because of lack of approval by Chinese Regulators. QCOM may or may not still want NXPI, but this will Open the doors for another company to possibly make an offer on NXPI because the Chinese President will make sure Mergers are approved by Chinese Regulators. I predict Merger Mania (speculation) will be going on from this point, because folks will now know China will approve just about anything. I will be buying NXPI in the Pre Market and possibly adding to my MU tomorrow morning. I also will be buying WDC and STX, as they could jump into this!Wishing Well To MU Shareholders!",

"As historically cyclical as this company’s business has been, to accurately value it on a P/E ratio you must average the earnings over the last 5-10 years. When you do that you will see this stock is not nearly as cheap as it seems.However, if you believe that memory pricing is becoming less cyclical (or at least will have higher highs and higher  lows going forward) then you would be a fool not to own it. Time will tell.Position: short puts",

"if you're not in this stock now, you've lost an opportunity",
3x earning + 3x FCF+ no debt+10 billion BB+ tech  stock+rev growth +oligopoly +product line increasing high margin products= this opportunity has never happened before. Only because of China I am only putting here 1/4 of my position but I will regret it. If it goes to 30 I’ll double,
Isnt the whole reason MU has had a low p/e is because Micron hasnt been able to sustain earnings in a down cycle. Yet here we are with them still making massive amounts of money by properly managing their cost yet people just ignore it and play dumb. Market needs to give this stock a proper p/e since it has already proven that they will easily be able to sustain profits and through a better cost structure will be even more profitable once demand picks back up in second half calendar year 2019,
Amazing to me that Micron grows revenue and profits during the trough of the cycle. Cycle? Where’s the cycle?,
"The problem with Micron is that it made too much money in 2018. Let say that the Eps was 7 $ IN 2018, the 2019 estimate= 8$ and the 2020 estimate= 9$, the share price would be 80$.",
"even with short term negative growth, this trough should be considered a great buying opportunity to get a piece of a company with obvious strong future.  similar situation to when Buffet first went heavy into Apple.",
"The Problem with the Analysts following MU isn't that they don't understand the Storage Bus. its that they apply Metrics broadly from Other Tech Business to Micron. They Shouldn't and neither should Investors. Its sad to see retail investors posting ""MU Should Be X Multiple"", and silly stuff like that, or comparing Micron to Apple or Nvidea or Netflix or something other than a Storage Company of which there are only 1.5 of, Hynix and the .5 being Samsung, that's IT, there's Nothing Else To Compare Too Period! And Hynix pretty much trades at the Same Multiple and always has. Most MU investors are simply too young, naive, and unknowlegeable about the business, and that's why they are perplexed. They don't understand the Cyclicality of Buisness in General, nor do they understand Things are Never Different, sometimes milder in troughs, but never different. All business have ups and downs. But most retail in MU are like a bunch of school children, still wet behind the ears, still trying to learn and understand the terminology, or just being plain naive and stupid posting nonsense continually. They want everything in the ""next 24 hours"". No wonder ALGO's are used so much in Micron trading daily......if they can keep fleecing the sheep.....its no different than the pide piper leading the mice......all to their demise. It gets funnier and funnier daily to see the same nonsense repeated over and over, and the newcomer sheep and mice keep getting killed. Eventually the Good Times in the US will slowdown, and unemployment will rise, and the sheep & mice won't have anything left. Then the New Cycle will begin all over again for the after the next Recession to be brought about when the DEM's take over in 2020 and reverse everything back to TAX & SPEND and Open Up the Borders for more Votes in 2024. The Millennials will never own a house unless its Inherited, because they want everything else 1st and NOW.",

"@Bill Maurer ,Once again, you write a bang-up truthful article, and the entire brigade of perma-pumper bulls come out in droves to try to discredit you. as they do to me ceaselessly.Thanks for writing.

Stay long mu,
"Here is my problem.  Micron looks like its results are going to be in the range that the ceo said they would be, as it should be, because he knows his business.  Analysts say that’s not good enough so the stock price goes down  these are the same people who had a 80 to 100 dollar price target a couple of months ago and now have a 45 to 70 price target.  Obviously they don’t know the business as well as they think  or they are trying to manipulate the price.  Either way, my question is why do they have this power to dictate whether a company is considered to be performing poorly or well?  Makes no sense to me.",
"""However, until we see significant evidence that DRAM and NAND pricing has really stabilized, a bottom cannot be put in.""There, in a single sentence, is why this author's opinions about Micron should be rejected as ill-informed. Likewise the writing of anyone else who allows device pricing to dominate their analysis.DRAM and NAND prices will never ""stabilize""; measured by price per bit they will continue to fall, because their manufacturers will continue to find ways to make bits more cheaply, just as they have for decades, and have additionally found ways to make devices faster while using less power. They follow in the footsteps of hard disk manufacturers who for decades managed to find ways to make their products faster and denser.Despite the prevalence of analysis myopically based on device prices, memory and storage business fundamentals have never been determined by device prices. That puts the cart before the horse. They have always been - and will always be - about the costs to manufacture and use bits. Those are the quantities that have always, and will always, drive the memory and storage industries. Company management (and investors) who focus on other quantities will find themselves outside looking in.",
"At some point, probably within the next 6 months, it will become apparent even to the most dense analysts, that micron is a gold mine, and the stock will fly. Hold strong and don't listen to the analysts. Micron is the best value in the S&P 500.Long MU",
Not another fkg Micron article - have you people nothing better to write about - this is the thirteenth or fourteen this week - that’s near THREE SA articles a day all saying substantially the same thing and disregarding the blatantly obvious that this is a darned cheap stock,
"Lofty price for mu. Now they falling on each other with negative scenarios  for mu. It seems that analysts like all of us, have the herd mentality. It seems that analysts are not to be trusted.",
Bill what r u smoking,
"I'm sorry, but I do not understand the logic of the message. By expecting revenue in the next two years (2019-2020), the company will receive half the market value. And according to the report, is the market value too high? This could be understandable if the company faced huge problems after 2020. But I know nothing about DRAM demand ending after 2020. By the numbers it looks very cheap stock, isn't it?",
"Not long ago,  analysts were falling on each other in anticipating",
"What is it that makes anyone money? EPS ? Dividends? Increase per share price? Shares taken off the street? I ask any of these analyst if they would invest in a widget company that will give you next year EPS of $9 and a PE Below 4 ? Micron made more money per share than adding together Nvidia, Intel, AMD and Texas instruments. The combined total. Micron trades at a PE barely above 3. You tell me that Micron not hitting $3.00 per share earnings the next report will make us all sell off because they are not worthy? Wow, just plain incredulous.",
Sanjay should pay dividends to shut up all negative news. Until he authorizes that we are like the pinata to be beaten with a stick 20 times per week! I am starting to hate Sanjay smiley face.,
"Just a general comment to no one in particular, having to do with frame of reference and context and being aware of picking numbers that fit a pre-formed thesis. Analysts estimates for EPS range from 2.78 up to 3.08 depending on what site you look at (EarningsWhisper, Nasdaq, Yahoo), who wrote the article, or how they did their math. I would like to humbly suggest, that an average value be used unless a specific boundary is being addressed, as opposed to bulls/longs picking the 2.78 to argue with for an ""easy beat"" or the bears picking 3.08 for ""almost certain to miss"". Bias subconsciously tends to move us towards what we want, or expect. Reality is often something else though the results can be similar to what we expect though not for the reasons we state. As an investor, I want reality. Not bias. That being said, I agree Bill that I would not read too much into the increased EPS, nor would I read too much into the revenue yet as both are within stated limits. Next quarter, average consensus (per NASDAQ) is anywhere from 1.91 to 3.01. That's a huge range with a 2.45 average. Next years (2019) full EPS is expected to be anywhere from 7.3-11.6, with that range growing to a whopping 4.6-13.44 range in 2020. In other words, no one seems to have a clue. The average of around 9-10 however, indicates potential for significant sustained earnings. We'll just have to wait and see. What we do know, is that Micron's financial position, along with product and full solution mixes is better than at any time in history so statistically, they are more likely to sustain earnings though putting a number on this is nearly impossible. It is of course, not guaranteed especially with the political and geopolitical climate at the moment.",
I liked the title of this article better when it came out yesterday and was written by Stone Fox Capital:seekingalpha.com/...,
"news negative, price movement - posotive;)",
this article provides nothing. everyone following mu knows the market is pricing the company for significant reductions in earnings and sales,
"Hello BillThank you for your article.Or anyone else that can answerIf Sanjay says they have mitigated all tariffs (90%) and tariffs are settled, does that money then go directly to profits and EPS?thanks",
"We know analysts numbers but what are the bull's actual numbers, for the next 5 years?$50 billion FY2023 revenue (10.7% annual growth)? What about earnings given the capEX and D&A burdens? Higher than revenue growth or lower? What valuation should the market give if convinced of 10.7% revenue growth and 8% EPS played out as: $10.80 | $12.00 | $15.00 | $9.50 (2021-2022 economic recession hits) | $17.50 ????",
"All this time, who knew we just needed tempered expectations and bear articles to put it back in the green. That confirms when everyone is long sell...",
Did I miss something? Sanjay just confirmed Revs low end of Guidance and Earnings higher end of Guidance. So Revs and Earnings are within their previous Guidance. It's not a slight of hand with Earnings. The buyback was announced last summer and any good CFO would figure that into their last Guidance. Sanjay went on to say that NAND would strengthen 2nd half. He also said Data Centers are only using 5% of their servers for AI. By 2025 Data Centers will be using 50% of their servers for AI. AI servers require 6 times more DRAM and 2 times more NAND! He also said 5G is coming. Somebody's going to be selling a boatload of Memory as we go forward.,
Falling Revenue results in Falling Margins.,
"Lets face the facts, Sears is more likely to survive than Micron at this point.  That's how bad it's become in Boise!",
"Last earning report, Micron gave a range that was lower than their 4th quarter results and they said this quarter would be 2.95 to 3.xx  and then this week the President said they would come in slightly higher than the 2.95 number and THAT IS BAD NEWS Mr Maurer !Gee, even NVIDIA can't make the money Micron is making and yet it's time to crash OR crush MU Agenda time folks !",
Maybe there will be yuge resolutions at the G 20 with a bigly outcome.,
"Maurer give us some real insight. This is simply a history lesson which most of us don’t need.  Where do you think asp will be, how much will they recover from cost cuts and technology transition?  How much will they improve by selling high end technology and solutions versus old tech that trend force tracks?  How much will they recover by bit expansion in pc, mobile, AI ?We really don’t need the history lesson. Doesn’t help in fast changing market.",
8 billion rev in a quarter is negative news for a company trading at only a 40 bil valuation. $2.95+ eps is a bad thing really? These articles that try to push a bearish narrative on a company that is performing so well are absolutely ridiculous. The company has already almost lost half its market cap all due to this nonsense. They act like this trades at a 1000 p/e and should just keep dropping. Open your eyes and actually look at the numbers this company is putting up. People keep comparing this to last cycle when the numbers are totally different. The company is no where near having negative free cash flow but the market is tanking the stock as if it will be.,
Not with reading or relying to.  The guy looks like he is a part time couch investor.  Geez - stop with these types of articles.,
Maurer your comparing pre q3 estimates with estimates since Sanjay gave them the closer range. That’s not really news,
"Alternatively, the buyback is a drop in the bucket right now, increasing EPS by mere pennies. Profitability of the company is driven just as much by costs of production as it is driven by ASPs, and just as DRAM ASPs decline over time with some difficulty in predictability, so do the costs of production. Your thesis assumes MU cannot reduce its costs in proportion to offset the DRAM ASP declines. This can go horribly wrong in two ways, either by overestimating ASP declines or by underestimating cost reductions by the firm, and possibly even in both ways concurrently. If MU proves the assumption wrong recurrently Q/Q, your thesis loses all its credibility. It's usually at that point that shorts lose their shorts. This is a major understated risk in your ""cautionary"" take on this stock. So to put it curtly, I urge investors caution regarding what you call caution, for what that caution may induce investors to do isn't so as cautious as it might seem.",
hopefully $20 EPS next year after buyback program is completed,
They talk about MU like it is priced like an Amazon or Google growth stock. This stock is priced like a stock on the verge of going bankrupt which of course it is not. I have bailed too early on other stocks so will stay with MU until the market gets a brain or I am shown to be a fool. I keep looking over my shoulder to see what I am missing but everything looks great to me based upon the stocks price.Question for everyone.  Do you think MU is doing the right thing using cash flow to buy back shares or should they do say  % of buybacks and start a dividend and raise the dividend every year?  Pro for buyback is price is so cheap and pro for dividend is maybe attract new type of investors and short term sample but buybacks are not lifting the stock price so far.Thanks and good luck to all longs and may the shorts lose their shorts.,
"The long game is that $MU could buy itself back in the next 5 years and they are generating a lot of FCF. If I had $43B I'd buy every single share and pay myself back in 4 years! Then make oh I don't know, about 20%-25% on my investment going forward. How is this stock trading here with this Cash Generation!!?? Wall Street is BLIND! Bill Gates, can I borrow $43B? I promise I'll pay you back in 4 years and donate tons to your charity!",
micron makes my butt hurt,
"Stock buybacks are not a ""prop"".  They are a permanent change to the capital structure which produce permanent increases in per share earnings.",
share buybacks create no wealth for company. indication of market constriction one or multiple causes,
"ASP's will continue to Fall, thats why Revenue is getting Lighter. W?O the Buybacks Earnings would have fallen a few cents. But with avg ASP's continuing to slide, buybacks won't be enough to prop up earnings for the full year. So, the downturn in Demand is temporarily Real for next 6- months as Samsung and Hynix also state. Probably best to Sell Calls evry week or 2 for the next 9 months, because MU isn't going back to the 50's for some time, the new markets just can't develop fast enough to make up for all the other issues.",
"With a PE of less than 4, I don’t understand why growth is an issue with the analysts. So what.. they have sweet profit margins and a business that isn’t going away, and they have a ton of cash.  Share buybacks a plus too.  It’s a canard as far as I can tell.  Keep your growth and PE metrics in line with other stocks, but not this one.",
"The cow says Muuu, atleast 7 times a day.",
"Assuming the $9.1 estimate for 2020 is accurate which I believe is far too low, I still can't figure out how the analysts and the market reconcile current share price with these numbers.  We are not talking about peak earnings.  2019 estimate seems reasonable or perhaps a little on the high side in my view. The imbalance may go on for a while but at some point (likely unexpected) it is bound to be corrected.",
"Let's all act like the multiples MU trades at are normal.Either way, this weekend will decide much more than analysts' estimates",
Wow! I can’t believe it’s been so long since the last MU article. It’s been a mercury month!,
"The company buys back stock at a 40% discount and that is not enough. Eliminates all debt, not enough. Record revenue with 3D chip market coming into play, which it has an absolute advantage over nearly everyone, again, stock declines. Y’all need the take a step back and appreciate what the company has done year to date rather than just panic selling because results miss slightly.",
"The sky is falling, pigs are flying but hey please click on another MU (ad nauseum) article. Bill, appreciate past articles but I am officially burned out on any articles saying nothing new",

Not a bad way to have some exposure to Genetech.,
"More options for AML patients is always good news. You referenced Pfizer's Daurismo which was recently approved for AML. Best median OS was 8.3 months, which isn't great. As for Venclexta, the CRs of 54% and 37% (combo with Decitabine and Azacitadine respectively) are very respectable, but the patients were not followed long enough to ascertain the durability of response. For those with CR, median time in remission was 4.7 months and 5.5 months (decitabine and azacitadine respectively).I'll just highlight MEIP whose drug Pracinostat is in 2 Phase 3s for AML (partnered with Helsinn) right now, in same patient population (chemo ineligible). If the Ph3s replicate Pracinostat's Ph2 results, it would likely be a far superior drug in AML than either of the ABBV and PFE drugs. Pracinostat Ph2 CR was 42% and median OS was a whopping 19.1 months. Results won't be out for another year or so. In the meantime stay tuned for further data on their candidate ME-401 (potential blockbuster) and interestingly on their new candidate, Voruciclib which looks like a perfect candidate to be dosed in combination with Venclexta across its indications. The promise of Voruciclib is that it will reduce the various hemo cancers' resistance to Venclexta, which emerges over time. Both ME-401 and Voruciclib have blockbuster potential in my opinion. Interestingly, MEIP key relationship with ABBV is likely to be one of partnership/cooperation for Venclexta across its indications, rather than competing in AML.",
Great news for leukemia patients!,
Saw the news release and wondering how much this potentially could add in dollars -,
ABBV has done a phenomenal job growing its oncology franchise. So far Rova-T has been disappointing for ABBV and patients.,
"Venclexta and  Daurismo have very different targets.  While they are both approved for relapsed AML,  these two drugs may  not work in the same patients.",
"The initial target population would be the older individuals who do not tolerate aggressive multi-drug regimens. I would expect that they’ll be studying Venclexta in relapsed AML and then with induction chemotherapy in those who who are eligible for standard treatments. (  Note-I’m making an educated guess. Have not done a search on clinical trials. )Hopefully, the indications will expand in the future.",
Keep going Abbvie. Owned for several years and enjoying every minute.,
"""Venclexta is already approved for another AML indication involving newly diagnosed relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.""Does not change the conclusions, but this leading sentence confounds two different cancers.

Great analysis. I looked at this a year ago and came to the same conclusion and bought . What good is all this if you yourself cannot trust your own analysis and pull the trigger?,
"Excellent article. In my opinion, your are missing few key points1. what % of sales is pain medication.  According to article below www.sfchronicle.com/...""Pain medications make up about 3 percent of all the drugs McKesson ships out, analysts estimate""Based on this it's not a significant revenue generator. The other problem is lawsuits. Both are constraints,but solvable problems.Overall, I'm buying I own shares and I do believe it's cheap based on Price to cash flow and future earnings. My average cost is $138. At a loss now hope to turn profit in 2-3 years fingers crossed",
"@Sven Carlin , Thanks for the video. We have conversed once before on BHF. I don't think I agreed with you then, but I agree with you on MCK. What needs to be mentioned is not just the uncertainty in American healthcare, but healthcare's relative costs in America. It's not just Amazon's pending competition that is worrisome, but the percentage of GDP attributed to healthcare is not sustainable. Either gov't intervention or private intervention (Amazon, for example) is coming. IMO, that's what the market is leery about. However, given how thin the operating margins already are in MCK's business (as well as in ABC and CAH), it's hard to imagine that reductions in cost will significantly come from these three or this sector. I find it hard to believe that AMZN can do anything accept lower some delivery costs, marginally. If the business was so simple to get into or affect, someone before AMZN would have tried. In America, the problem lies in how we deliver healthcare, fee for service as opposed to fee for outcome. Incentives are clearly unaligned between healthcare provider and patient under a fee for service model.",
"Oh PillPack ShmillPack!  There is one thing, and one thing only holding back MCK:  the threat of government action curtailing the use of opioids.  Personally, I think opioids are the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Try getting on to 90 with arthritis and no pain meds...But ... know what I say when I look at the chart for MCK?  ""Doggone MCK!""  (actually, I say worse than that, but 'nuff sed)  I would have gotten rid of MCK looooong ago, except that their numbers are sooooo good.  Ole Seth K. is late to the pill party - smart man.Welp, I gotta go help mom with her pain meds, then we're watching the game tonight.  Adios!",
"By the way, I have noticed that Seth Klarman has not had the best of track records. It seems that just calling oneself a Hedge Fund manager gets unwarranted attention, even when the track record has a hard time beating a checking account.",
"Unfortunately, the opioid headwinds are not going to go away soon. There will probably be an industry-wide settlement, just to lift the uncertainty in the stocks.I don’t see the big threat from AMZN here. The margins are already tight, and the distribution infrastructure is different from the unregulated one that Amazon is used to. PillPack is not equivalent to the supply chain that the big three distributors have and it won’t come close. It is a service on top of the regular distribution/online retail model.MCK is hard to understand as an investment because of the restructuring of their businesses and investors are worried about political pressures on drug prices and about fines or settlements. Whether they are guilty or not, they will pay to have the problem go away as long as all of the plaintiffs go away together.",
sounds like a good investment but i just cant invest in a company that sells opioids. Opioids provide a valuable relief when used properly but way way over used and abused and they know it. Plus i think amazon and the opioid blow back will be more damaging then projected,

LPI reported they are going to be reporting a $112.2 million gain on hedges in Q4 so should be a pretty good earnings report it sounds like though most of that gain is a result of oil prices falling so their realized price obviously was lower before hedges.

"West Texas Intermediate has fallen 34% since October, settling around $52 this month. The 24-month forward curve has followed suit, reaching $53 as of Dec. 13. BloombergNEF estimates that prices this low threaten the economics of some U.S. oil plays.BNEF’s break-even model calculates that an average Permian well can produce oil for under $50 a barrel, but only the top performers in the Denver-Julesburg or Bakken can match that. In addition, this quarter’s increase in natural gas prices has helped offset declining oil prices in plays with substantial gas output, such as the STACK.Producers are likely to react if oil stays low. Rig activity usually lags three to six months behind oil, so watch for drilling efforts to be cut in 2019 if prices do not turn up.Oil and gas basins analyzed for BNEF production costsSee the BNEF Theme on Economics of U.S. Shale Oil and Gas Production here",
i still wonder what wp has done in this fall from 9 to 4. i know they let loose of fund 9... but still with 40 mil shares how do they not short against it? and dont tell me they are high moral people... its money,

shorts have let up a little . i would like to think that more will realize this company isnt going away unless oil in the 30s for years.. i never buy a stock thinking it will be bought out. but if you live in a commodity world the time to take out another company is when they are beaten down. hell i was looking a fang. 140 down to 90.. . right now you take out lpi for ?12 and its probably accretive.,
65 etf's with this in it and all of them play toys for algos. i start twitching when i think of it. i think i was thinking in the 4s because i  did buy a little more at 4.10,
According to bloomberg $1.04 FY18 and $0.99 FY19 already revised lower,
if they touch the low estimate for 2019 revs it almost a 50% haircut. in early feb the next cc will be an eye opener not only for the next 9 months projections but how much capex they burn through for those 9 months.   at this point they might as well chew up the 200 mil buyback but i doubt that. . get too much shit...,
The stock is trading below book value (80%) .. 3.8x earning and below 4x EV/ EBITDA... unless we see another major crash in oil prices I really don’t see it going much lower and the whole pipeline issue is coming to an end soon and again the hedges will protect them in ‘19 .. JPM has TP of $7 and has been one of the most aggressive ( one of 2 with underweight rating).. But again LPI is on 20+ ETFs so the selling pressure might come from different places - but hopefully it will go back to it’s mean vs XOP which will be around $7.50 at current price,
"LPI is again at all time low vs XPO and also vs WTI .. avg 12 month target price @ 8.62 .. down from $12 not too long ago. Pretty much lowered by all analysts.. 6 buys , 9 holds and only 2 sells",

"there isnt a whole lot they can do now,.. they let a crew go in mid november and are conserving cash until permian opens up... their earnings will take a hit in 2019. their production will also take a hit till at least mid year. at that point in time they go back to smaller pads ?8-16 rather than 32s. oil cut might get back to the 46 area where they were before going to  the 32s. un fortunately shale model makes it hard to hunker down ad try for break evn fcf.",

I think the XOP is the main culprit in the recent sell off,
Very low volume over the past days and with XOP getting crushed puts lot of pressure in names like LPI which is 1.2% of XOP.. that’s equivalent to $3mm seller since XOP traded $280mm,
This is all time low.. very soon they will be able to buy back 100% of the free float with the $100mm they still got authorized for buybacks..,
yep. tax loss and shit backdrop.... 3s by noon,

"LCII uses ROIC as one of its compensation elements which is usually a good thing.  However, EPS is also used and share buybacks reduce the level of capital making both targets easier to hit.

"Clearly, $156 million in cash and nothing drawn on their credit line at year end, is remarkably good news.  I hazard to guess, no one had this much cash in their forecast.  Certainly, the market was aware liquidity would improve as they drew down inventories, but not to this extent.  A very good quarter indeed.I think sometime, after the pre payment penalties expire in mid April and before the Q1 earnings report, they will call $100 million worth of the 6.5%'s.Remember, before the Q4 panic in the markets, the rating agencies were upgrading CLMT's debt and Go and Griffin were buying stock at $6 and $7 a share.",
Mr. market must be impressed with the CLMTs press release. 8.86% gain as I write. If were to guess; I would think that CLMT may be buying some of their stock instead of paying a dividend. I could not resist what my charts were telling me so I added to my position this morning on a pull back.,
"My model showed $139M in cash at the end of 4Q and I underestimated by $17M: $25M from inventory reduction, $22M from hedges in place for 4Q. These 2 items do not flow through EBITDA. The WCS-WTI differential, while lower now, was very high ($35-$40) in late 3Q and 4Q, could add $35M net of transportation for the unhedged portion. These 3 items alone can contribute $82 to cash. I figure also that the fuel portion probably had a -$5M in EBITDA net of the hedges and WCS -WTI differential. Add $50M EBITDA from the Specialty and subtract $56 for interest and capex gets to the $139M. Going forward, the hedges CLMT put in place are very important for 2019 from the cash generation standpoint - can be as much as $140M if my model is correct! If the rest of the business is cash neutral in 2019, this will cause CLMT to end 2019 with about $300M in cash!",
"I was shocked by the press release.  They acknowledged that the LCM will have a large affect on earnings for 4Q, but went on to say that it would affect adjusted EBITDA as well. Everyone else has LCM as an item that is adjusted out of EBITDA precisely because it is non-cash and has nothing to do with operating results.  It is astonishing to me that they would directly address this, and then continue their stupid practice of leaving it in.  It means that adjusted EBITDA is going to be absolutely terrible.  I'm estimating that the LCM will be about negative $20MM for the quarter.I also have to say that all of the comments about their liquidity and the self-help reminds me of 3Q17 when they delayed announcing earnings, but gave liquidity numbers.  The actual results a month and a half later were a total disaster.  Doesn't mean the same thing will happen this time, but I just have a bad feeling here.  Cracks were adequate in 4Q, assuming everything went well operationally.  But given the bad LCM, I don't see adjusted  EBITDA of over $35MM for the quarter.  And if anything went wrong, look out below.And I agree with Lsv.  First quarter is looking to be a nightmare.  No, cracks are not as bad as they were in the winter of 2015-2016, but they are still terrible.  And Specialty was doing much better then, and they had Superior to bail them out on the Fuels side.  Plus they lost an astounding amount of money then.  Losing half as much money as they did then might not be as bad objectively, but they are starting in a much worse place now.  In case anyone is in doubt, I am extremely nervous about them right now",

Any opinion reallybigfish?(Edited)",
"San Antonio is about a $10M EBITDA annual headwind per a recent conversation with management, and the isomerate project could bring it into modest profitability -- so definitely not a good asset with LLS spreads where they are but not a thesis-buster/disaster.My biggest very near-term concern is how management communicates the negative LCM impact in 4Q, which I'd expect to be north of $20M.  It's non-cash and largely irrelevant -- and any competent management team would account for LCM in reported adjusted EBITDA -- but the messaging has consistently been embarrassingly bad, and the story is obviously very fragile.  I worry management doesn't realize the magnitude of the credibility issues it has (very deservedly) developed over the past 15 months.The quarter should otherwise be fine.  My sense is Specialty slowed down a touch more and a touch earlier than typical seasonality as the global markets swooned; so volumes might not be great, but it's a relatively light quarter anyway and profitability should be very good in both segments.I've increased my exposure after sitting on my hands for a while.  The credit/equity valuations make little sense, there's just too much low-hanging-fruit to pick, and the price action has provided more than ample impetus and incentive for management to act.  It's just absolutely crucial for management to provide transparency -- lay out targets and provide a coherent corporate strategy/roadmap.  We aren't in the sort of environment in which investors will blindly wait things out, nor has CLMT even remotely earned that benefit of the doubt.",
Mark I look at the refining universe - vlo hfc psx ect to give me a general indication of expectation for the refining sector.I look at speciality chemicals  neu ect to get a general indication of speciality chemical sector.I look at wcs-wti spreads via futures.I look at clmt bonds.I look at energy bonds cause clmt is tagged with energy label I look at short interest in clmt The holders list is kind of irrelevant for the equity but I do keep an eye on bond holders.I follow cds for clmt and see if protection is bought I look at high yield index and etfs I look at sell side analysts on clmt and talk to most of them All in combination gives me an idea on clmt.  But by lead indicator for clmt is bond prices.,
MarkThe problem with your analysis is you  look at spot and extrapolate.  Refining does not trade on current alone.  Futures tell you something.  It won’t ever match (commodity is too volatile) but it’s futures where one can hedge. Clmt should be glad at least its sell side coverage also covers other refining companies. Refining is very volatile why it makes little sense to own it in a mlp structure.  Hopefully clmt divest both refining and mlp structure.,

Commentor1 I ran my numbers with a street analyst who knows the company well.  He agrees but credit markets are not his area so he is nervous and hesitant to raise his price targets. A very simple sum of parts 200 mil ebitda at 10x - $2000Montana $400 San Antonio $0Working capital delta + $50 $2450 -$1500 net debt $950 / 80 mil units = $12 approximately Trading at $2.10 - tells you how dislocated the market is.  But then you have a distribution crowd that has been kept in dark for 3 years and will be for another 2 years (most likely for ever ) One thing is with owning both refining and speciality and having debt over 2-3x you never ever get the 10 multiple.  The idea of having refining in a fixed mlp structure is beyond stupid.  Why the gp did it - cause to run their capital market scheme they need cheap ebitda to buy.  Specialist chemical ebitda is 12-13 to purchase assets.  I am sure value and credit and distressed hedge funds fund  by clmt if it has the right structure. It’s sad to see clmt huddled with the likes of emes and not neu or another speciality chem company.A grade assets B grade cap structure C grade management F grade governance/gp,

So I am trying to understand why the repetition - since no one disagrees with you.    The same incompetent management is in place and going nowhere.  Incompetent management will continue to be incompetent, no?   So, can you explain why you are in the name?  I am confounded why you would own CLMT with all of the reasons you have cited.",
If anyone wants to know if the gp/fehsenfeld is awake Clmt started with a $22 mil investment by grube and fehsenfeld in 1991 to acquire an asset.  Today go stake is worth $34 mil.The gp has taken a money via distributions and idr but their company is worth a pittance of what they have invested.  Their question is absolute return on their ownership or continue the same failed control game they have been playing,
Commentor1 There is 1.6 bil - 1.5 bil net of debt and $170 mil of equity.  One better obsesses about the debt and figure out how to roll it.  Or else clmt will be giving the keys to the bond holders who will have the classic good company bad balance sheet restructuring.  The old clmt was capital market scheme - little of those distributions and idr in 2014 and 2015 were made from fcf.  It was all raise money in capital markets to pay out - that scheme has come to an end.Let’s see if the gp or management step up and buy any shares - I don’t doubt it. The reality is cannot be a 4 times levered company  paying a distribution especially when ones debt is trading at mid teens yields.  It’s time to unwind this whole structure and bring in real institutional investors.I am expecting 65-70 mil of ebitda for 4q - they will generate cash.  Hopefully it goes to paydown debt,
G I am more like the buffett saying about investing in companies that can be run by idiots cause eventually an idiot will run it.Clmt has had a string of idiots running and governing it.  Speciality chemical still chugs along - think what competence would do to the asset,
"Blazer,First of all, the assets are worth far more than the current enterprise value, recent industry transactions attest to this.Secondly, the fundamentals are good, maybe even great for Specialty, while Montana is very well positioned in the fuels segment.Thirdly, the key metric is FCF.  We won't know what this is until they report in February.Rehashing past events, obsessing about debt maturities, insisting on C corp structure, trashing management and the GP accomplishes nothing.  There is as likely a possibility that in two years or so, after the debt has been refied, they reinstate a distribution as there is a change to C corp.",
A Winston Churchill observation about the US comes to mind when thinking about CLMT. “You can always count on Americans to do the right thing... but not until they have exhausted all the alternatives”.,
GCapacity or desire of management and gp are irrelevantThe underlying assets and the debt structure will force action.They have 27.5 months.  They stock has to have woken them up from their incompetence.  Only upside of the bloodbath is it has happened 27.5 months before refinancing not 3.,
G I think fehsenfeld are fundamentally incompetent.  This is a 3-4 generation family business.  Nothing here is earned just inherited.  They got to be looking at $600-$700 mil of value destroyed and thinking what is going on.The gp ran a compete capital market scheme.  They announced acquisitions and massive cap ex plans and funded it with debt and equity units in a hot mlp market.  All that capital raised was used to pay inflated distributions and idr.  It seemed like free money.  We just buy crappy stuff and do crappy projects and take in another extra $250 mil that we can payout with focusing on actual cash flows the business generates.  I don’t think they have fundamentally got over the easy mlp scam that went on and still think they can go back to it in the future.  That is why they have never given up control or became a c Corp.  The gp is hoping to go back to the good old days even when that business model is forever gone. The management is another bunch of second tier players.  They have full protection from gp having control.  Same time business generates cash so life is good.  All this came to an end when the credit markets freaked out.  Now if clmt was a private company the credit markets would be looking at underlying business and be fine.  But given the let’s keep control and jerk the low information retail mlp investors around has spread contagion from a irrelevant market cap equity into the credit markets. Management whole strategy is this absolute made up self help stuff than cannot be found in the financial statements and a run Montana for cash flow.  They have little to show for their 3 years - unit’s $2 versus $15 when go took over.  West came from exxi which when bankrupt with serious governance issues.  So what is the upside with gp and management that are definitely not A team players.  The debt will govern this - there are no games left but pay down debt.  The debt is too much and the fehsenfeld are to incompetent to do anything other than pay down debt.Assets will have to be sold in refining - their value will be determined by buyer.The speciality chemical business is like a Berkshire cash flow business. It can sustain then debt when used as secure collateral.  Neither management or gp have any choice left.  I don’t expect either to buy units.Franklin controls the debt - question is do they anchor rolls.,
Blaser. Glad you are on the ship. There are a bunch of us rats still on board who are hoping that things improve substantially. You have outlined the needed strategy going forward. Do you have any evidence that the gp and management understand what is needed?  Do you think they have the capacity and desire to execute that strategy?,
"2018 was very similar to 2008 for clmt without any real macro issues.The mlp structure and the gp/management decision to stretch a broken investor base for another 2 years finally broke.  Can only drag around non distribution paying retail investors for so long - turns out 3 years is long enough.  No buyers, fatigued sellers and the worst December for markets since the Great Depression destroyed clmt beyond my worst expectations. 2019 clmt needs to sell assets, turn into a c Corp and bring in new value investors, generate free cash, pay down debt and re engage with credit capital markets. I never owned clmt till 2018 and had low expectations of gp and management.  I was wrong - they are really much much worse than my low expectations.  I liked the assets and more work I do I like them more.   It’s remarkable these assets have survived this gp and clmt management.  More work I do to get a background of gp, management and assets digging into 2010-2016 timeframe I am reaching the conclusion clmt was basically access the capital markets (debt and equity) scheme.  All these acquisitions were done simply to access capital markets to fund excessive distributions and idr.  Pure short term greed by the gp.  Fehsenfeld blew up clmt.",
"Lvs One is vertically integrated and one is not.  Clmt refinery in Shreveport is run as a vertically integrated entity.

"HFC a low quality comp (more refining than speciality chemical but growing via acquisition in speciality chemicals) is flat for the year.  It has had a drawdown in 4q but for the year is flat.

For all the talk of macro and speciality chemical cycle (it is a very stable business relative to anything in energy or commodity chemicals) there is little market price action sign of distressed/impending world ending in anything but clmt. Majority of clmt issues relate to debt and A terrible orphaned non distribution paying mlp structure.  Both these need to be addressed to move forward.  It is amazing how playing the mlp distribution growth and raising capital game the gp has destroyed so much value for themselves.  2018 was a year of sheer stupidity by management and gp in playing the orphaned mlp and running refining for cash game.  Both those will have to end in 2019-2020. I am still shocked the units traded with a 1 handle.  Feb 15th the 13-f will show if there has been any institutional buying (very tough with mlp structure).All my conversations with street analysts has informed me that a lot of accounts (credit, equity, hedge fund distressed) are looking at clmt.

"I would look at BHYETRUU:INDBloomberg Barclays High Yield Energy TR Index Value Unhedged USDThis shows the high yield energy space.

Adjusted for dividends the high yield etf actually have outperformed the spy and are down 1-2 percent on absolute basis.  This is not 2008 or even 2015-2016 in energy land.

"Lvs You need to know credit markets - high yield, distressed, leveraged loans, rescue financing and the macro of corporate credit cycles to invest in clmt.  The typical mlp let’s get a distribution carried little weight with clmt going forward.I will tell you one think - in a normal credit market a 5x levered speciality chemical company generating free cash flow and solely focused on paying down debt (improving credit metrics) would have little trouble refinance debt.Clmt has a 27.5 month window before a potential insolvency event.  In that time frame I expect asset sales, credit rating upgrade (starting with moody), free cash flow generation and capital market transactions.  No significant price appreciation in units without corresponding improvement in credit.  At least the clmt conversation will be credit centric not the typical distribution is coming mlp retail thinking.",
"Apparently, 2019 is the start of a 3 year long refinancing cycle for corporate debt totaling about 2.5T$. Median Debt/Ebitda is 3.4, highest for a long long time. It is widely considered to be where the bubble is this time.Some other entities I follow are having their stock decimated on refinance concerns (See TK with a Jan 2020 refinance due with close to, but not quite, 100% asset coverage)My read? 1) There will be enormous competition for refinancing in 2019 and 20. 2) Calumet is one of the weaker entities - going by debt/ebitda of about 5+ on an optimistic 300 Adj. Ebitda for 18 and about 1500 net-debt - and likely in the bottom 20 percentile. 3) Even if GF is sold early 2020 and an additional 100 is paid off in 2019 from cash flow, proforma (adjusted for GF alse) net-debt to ebitda will still be 5+.My conclusion: I am beginning to fear the worst for the company for the first time. This competition for refinance aspect is new information to me. I won't short nor long anything  because I am not smart enough to know what rabbits can be pulled out the hat.",
Short interest as of 12/15 has come down to 862k a reduction of 200k.  Does not look like anyone is going anything cap stature - buying bonds shorting stock.,
"Commentor1 Clmt has become a show me credit story.  Management and GP need to get serious about showing their strategic path to getting delevered.  Clmt needs to expand it investor base for the sole purpose of showing to credit markets it is a survivable equity.  This could be a 7-9x investment in 3-5 years if clmt management soley delivers on delevering, asset sales and a speciality chemical ebitda of $225 mil.",
"Hopefully, the spell has been broken and we can begin the healing process.CLMT remains a ""show me"" stock, so not expecting much until they demonstrate an ability to generate FCF.However, with tax selling abating and the market calming down we may recoup some of the fear trade from the past three months.",
One of you guys used to monitor the job postings at Superior and was able to forecast the imminent sell.  Anyone monitoring GF?,
"Anyone have any thoughts on the GP picking up a bunch of shares at these prices ?  Is there any spike in traded volume that is suggesting something of this sort ? If the GP with their new vernture arm is reluctant to step in here, hmmn.. wonder when/if they will at all.",
"I got accused of being a short for saying clmt could trade to 3 2 1 - that lugging mil plus shares.From here $2.07 i think clmt here is a 7-8-9 x trade over next  2-5 years.  The ride will be volatile as expected with any multi bagger.Hfc is down 3 percent - hfc is a low asset comp to clmt. Neu down 3 percent this year This is not 2008.  CCC and leverage loan is shut down for now but will open up on 2019 Fehsenfeld can think over the holidays if they want control of orphaned mlp or absolute return, west can think another bankruptcy after exxi will look questionable on his resume and go can think his tenure is $16 to $2.  I expect the bs we have seen from clmt to come to an end",
Cause they need an announcement or a market indication of process when they get active in capital markets to refinance the 21.I think they will put up solid 4q number and 1-2q in speciality.  Refining will be a back end trade on imo2020 in 2019.  They won’t be able to milk it but will have to sell into it.Summer 2019 you will see clmt in credit markets.  They expect an upgrade from moody when leverage goes below 6.  I also see credit markets opening up.  The guys sharpening their pencils now could provide a secondary anchor along with Franklin. I expect west to try and do $400-$500 mil.  It will have a nice coupon to tempt anchors in before asset sale but they will need to indicate a sale is under way.  The bs they say today (we have a price on all assets) won’t carry any weight.  3-4q wcs spread at 27-30 and 2020 could be in same range.I think fehsenfeld probably have reached their limit with management and also probably understand the stupidity of their mlp decision this summer.  Clmt management just tired to be too clever and communicated badly.  Neither clmt management or gp understood how tired the mlp retail base was.  I tired and explain it but the price action exceeded anything I thought we would see.  Retail stocks and retail investors are a beast of their own creation.San Antonio might be a very interesting little asset for a trading entity - input out all very tradeable.  $50 mil might be a good option value and clmt can offer takeaway to hedge some risk of operating facility.,
"Clmt 21 bonds 85-86 Not a lot of volume.  No major blocks or potential blocks - no one seeking liquidity. Just drifting slightly lower in a terrible tape.Given franklin controls 40 percent of the unsecured debt class and other insurance holders own 10 percent.  Clmt would be a very tough control investment for any distressed account as Franklin would hold thru and work out thru any restructuring.  I spoke to nearly every sell side analyst who covers clmt.  Lots of incoming phone calls from the largest pe, private lending and credit institutional shops.  Very little incoming equity calls - expected as there is little institutional  equity ownership due to mlp structure.   The focus from the credit guys is on the great falls asset.  As I have stated selling great falls will be main catalysts along with earnings and cash flow (debt paydowns).One analyst had great falls at $300-$400 mil plus inventory and San Antonio at $75 mil plus inventory.Another at great falls at $650 mil which I think is too high .Expected buyers according to analysts were Canadian integrated, hfc and par.  Us oil/river stone was a cited example by a few except it is a rail Bakken feedstock refinery. clmt saving grace is 28 month window - lots can happen in 28 months.  Credit markets will reopen.  I expect great falls sale announcement between 4q 2019 and 2q 2020.  Closing date is irrelevant - on announcement Clmt will be able to roll the debt.",
"MarkThere will be no stock buyback.  This company needs to delever - only thing it will (and should) buy back in the public markets should be in nearest maturity debt.  The rating agencies would freak out on stock buyback or releverage.  The bonds would trade down too.  Clmt is a simple trade.  Sell refining pay down debt, generate fcf in speciality chemical pay down debt.  Pay down debt till $600 mil in net debt.  Think of it as a mlp in reverse instead of borrowing money buying assets and paying a distribution.  For next 5 years it is sell asset, generate cash and pay down debt.",
"Mark:  Thanks, but I'm still way down on this week's purchases on CVRR.  I think that there's some short term opportunity, but as Mario noted, Mr. Icahn now has made clear that there is a limit here.On CLMT, even though some people here have very kindly congratulated me on selling back in August, I don't take a lot of satisfaction from it.  I really should have sold out the day that they announced that they wouldn't release their 3Q17 earnings on time.  I should have listened to my old mentor who told me ""there's never just one cockroach"" in investing.  I think that there are still cockroaches at CLMT.",
"Mario:  I usually don't feel obligated to report all of my transaction on SA, but since you asked, I sold all of my CVRR on the large pop that came when the 3rd quarter numbers were way above the analyst's expectations (and almost exactly what I predicted).  With cracks falling substantially and the Midland differential being cut in half, it just didn't seem like the time to stick around.  I bought back some earlier this week and some more yesterday.  I think that you are right that Icahn will use the current weakness (which his minions certainly could have engineered) to buy in the rest of the equity.  But that would be at the 20 day moving average, which is currently in the 13's.I mean, look, the entire market has been hit hard.  Energy even harder.  And MLP's have been crushed beyond belief.  So yes, some of CLMT's equity price problem is the current stock market situation.  But I bought CLMT a year and a half ago because it really looked like management was turning things around (back when I believed the ""self-help"" numbers), and all sorts of macro tail winds were developing to take a highly leveraged borderline survival company to a great gain.  But now that those macro tail winds have virtually all disappeared, and maybe a couple even reversed, the leverage issue works the other way.  And I don't like those odds.",
Lsv It easy to settle for me - I am long the stock and buying more so I have picked a side.,
My view is that for a wcs producer in Canada who has significant fixed costs and capex and extremely long life assets (40 years).  Great falls is an exceptional asset - it cannot be cheaply replicated and they don’t come on the market often. Great falls before the $400 mil cap ex did not have size scale or complexity.  Now it it still as small refinery but 25k barrels is much bigger scale than 10k.  If someone can buy it for its recent cap ex and upgrade it will be a great purchase at $400 mil.  It is mainly pipeline feed.  It’s a perfect little hedge for a wcs producer looking at 27 wcs differential in 4q 2019.,
I think clmt can sell refining for $400 mil. and generate $250-$300 mil in free cash in next 52 months.  That should bring debt down to below $1 bil.,
Brian SmithI have $350 modeled in Montana and $400-425 for all pure refining assets.  I expect asset sales to trade place before or concurrently with the 2021 being rolled.  I think the asset sales prices for Montana are largely driven from the strategic need for the asset by wcs producers and clmt specific issues. I was an activist in a energy company in 2008 that sold international assets and had 13 parties in the data room in the middle of the world ending.  If I was the fehsenfeld I would seriously be concerned right now.    They totally dropped the ball on c Corp conversion.  They also went along with plan to use a mlp tax shield and refinery cash flow to pay down debt.  What neither they nor management understood is you can only stretch a broken mlp base and event hedge funds so far.  They need to address the debt.  I think everything should be on the table for them including bringing in a strategic pe partner like fortress Blackstone ect.West has been a disappointment - for a guy who was around exxi as it imploded he should have learned something.  It’s time to stop flying the  plane and get serious about work.They have 28 months to refinance $900 and 52 months to refinance 1.6 bil.  It’s time to sell refining and move on with life.  I think,
"I think they can sell Montana for $350-400M and San Antonio for $40-50M.  Having spoken with management about Montana, I'm comfortable with that range, but things obviously become more difficult if the credit markets and refinery margins weaken further and/or CLMT becomes a more distressed seller.  As I've mentioned before, I'm relatively certain they won't own Great Falls in 18 months, so the story should get much cleaner.  Completely agree with your game plan, by the way.  Leverage is 95% of the problem, and the lack of FCF has been an enormous disappointment.  I still think Specialty is a good business and will be fine, but hard not to be concerned by the extent to which we were blindsided by the communication and execution missteps.",
Brian SmithWhat do you think Montana and San Antonio refineries are worth ?,
"Very likely they'll be closed out near the expiration date (i.e., not exercised).",
"any thoughts on price action in january, when the 8000 puts (strikes 7 and 5) will be exercised? as only 500 k shares short, at least 3000 puts may be unhedged, unless the short interest does not include option market mskers shorts (dont know).if puts are assigned and price level stays the same, will new unit owners keep or dump them?",
"Wells Fargo Valuation $7 used to be $10 $7Speciality chemicals 216 @ 9x = 1,944Refining  91 @ 3x = 273Value 2,217Debt (net) 1500Equity residuals 717717/77 = 9.31 @ 75 percent = $6.98 For $10 he used 10 speciality chemical multiple and 4 for refining.It time to get out of refining.   The street is undervaluing refining assets.  Sell refining and become a speciality chemicals company.  Even if leverage goes up a turn - it’s time to simplify this company.  Get rid of the mlp and become a c Corp and then keep delevering.  I am reaching the conclusion it better to sell refining and then delever instead of using blended cash flows to delever. At $2.26 the gp/fehsenfeld got to be worried about their investment. It’s gone from 40 to 2.26.  The equity market cap is less than the distribution and idr in 2014/15.  They cannot still be holding out for an idr or some control premium.  They need to save their investment and get as much out of it on a absolute return basis.The gp  has to be stressed.  The management too - is west going to go brag about ch22.  Who is going to hire go.  They need to de risk delever and simplify clmt.  This should have been done in 2018 but management and gp seriously dropped the ball.",
Brian Smith I get some intel on Heritage but sadly it is not from Clmt management or clmt directly.  I get It via momentum and Hcci.  My take is they are shocked with price action.  I wish there was some interaction between gp and clmt shareholders.  This triangulation of information is tough. Clmt management is restricted in buying stock till after reporting - feb/March.  I assume so is gp and gp members on clmt board.They need to sell Montana and San Antonio.  Montana is very sellable.  It time they tell Tudor Pickering to go get bids and run a data room.  They are serious about transacting.  This also needs to be told to the market that refineries will be up for sale and sold between 2019 and 1h2020.  I was told there was a meeting to discuss c Corp and then clmt management went from  pro c corp to let’s wait and see.  That was probably gp being their lethargic self and saying we can make a decision later down the road.  Now they probably looking at today and thinking what is happening to the stock.  This is way I look at it 1.6 bil of debt 90 mil cash end of 2018 75 mil cash generation 2019 300 mil sale Montana 50 mil sale San Antonio 50-75 mil cash generation 2020 after asset sales $1-1.05 bil of debt on speciality alone 5x levered - leverage does tick up 202120222023 Build cash to get leverage down and speciality ebitda up - $800 mil of debt There is no way forward but for the sale of refining,
"My conversations with management illuminated the concerns I outlined above.  They think they're caught up in a dumb money retail exodus and/or the victims of a broad-based sell-off in energy stocks/credits.  I don't think they realize the extent to which they've fueled the fire by screwing up the cadence of and communication around turnaround activity and generally failing to discuss the inner workings of their business.  I've had blunt conversations with management, but time will tell whether they realize they need to change their approach.  They've both personally lost a ton of money lately, so let's hope they wake up.Totally agree about what they're trying to do with Great Falls.  I understand the temptation to get it while the getting is good (i.e., run it for cash while diffs are wide), but that strategy appears to have failed, and 2018 will have been largely a wasted opportunity.  But they realize it's a distraction, and I'm convinced it'll be sold within the next 12-24 months.  Hope it's sooner rather than later.There's no question in my mind Tim and West are pushing the C-Corp conversion.  My sense is Heritage wanted to take a wait-and-see approach, but I'm also highly confident it'll happen at some point.  My understanding is they've found a tax workaround, so I don't think that's the problem.  Honestly not sure what the issue is, but West definitely changed the messaging in October, and I don't think he did it accidentally.My best guess is they'll put up a decent 4Q (excluding non-cash LCM impact, which they'd better frickin' explain) -- with Fuels finally cash flowing nicely and Specialty only in-line owing to a softer-than-normal December lull -- and they'll open the kimono a bit on the call (although probably not to the extent we'd like).  They know they need to push out maturities, and they need a receptive credit market to do so; and keeping investors in the dark with their equity in a death spiral and credit yielding in the teens isn't the answer.  I've been given the distinct impression that Heritage is frustrated, but we obviously haven't seen any action, and I have no idea what is going on behind the scenes.The reality is they should be able to put up pretty good Specialty numbers in 2019 if crude hangs around the $45-60 level and the macro isn't a mess.  They should over-earn even while slowly giving back price.  Fuels will obviously be a bit more challenged and might be closer to $75M than the $125M that seemed more likely a month ago.  Management just can't allow fear over Fuels over-shooting to the downside to drive the discussion.  That's why they need to either sell Great Falls or communicate that it's for-sale.  Some of the San Antonio problems appear to have been fixed (probably a $5-8M EBITDA drag around here so not a disaster), and plenty of low-hanging-fruit still to pick in Specialty (even if the $65-70M of incremental ""self-help"" focused on Specialty is way overstated).",
Brian Smith What do you think happens in 2019 ? My conversations with management have been pretty similar to what you have laid out.I don’t think they really get it.They need to sell the refining business.  Trying to run it for cash flow and then selling just seems like they are threading the needle.  Sell it and delever.The whole bs they did about becoming a c Corp and then not was just plain stupid.  Even if leverage goes up 1/2 turn on speciality they should sell refining.They need to partner with a smart pe shop - it’s time the gp realizes they have screwed up and get a competent partner,
"The market cap is irrelevant given the leverage.  CLMT equity is really just a call option at this point; no one cares about FCF yield to the equity or even equity valuation.  The enterprise value has contracted by <20% as the stock has plummeted to $2.40 from $7.50.  That's the power of leverage.  My thesis assumed Specialty profitability and refining tailwinds would allow leverage to generate the opposite effect.  I've been very wrong so far.Execution has definitely been lacking, but, as I've said from the start, these guys have done an absolutely abysmal job messaging, and I'm afraid the same thing will happen in 4Q, as I'm sure the LCM effect on EBITDA (likely $20M+) will catch people by surprise absent some (unlikely) change to reporting methodology that normalizes adjusted EBITDA for non-cash charges and/or non-apples-to-apples comparisons.  They're completely oblivious to the razor's edge they're on in terms of margin for error, and they repeatedly disappoint and then appear surprised that ""retail investors"" don't understand the results (which are near-impossible to normalize for the sake of comparison).The reality is most of CLMT's problems will go away if they can get Specialty EBITDA to $200M.  Forget $225M or $250M or the other targets I still think they're capable of hitting.  The volatility inherent to refining is only an issue because they've crapped the bed in Specialty this year and repeatedly disappointed investors into a lousy tape -- so now the window to refinance is (temporarily) closed, the comps look awful, and the momentum is enormously negative.I hate to say it, but while I like Tim personally and think he's a smart and capable guy, he clearly wasn't ready for this seat.  He doesn't know how to craft a story and sell it to (or even effectively communicate with) investors -- credit or equity -- and with the messiness and complexity inherent to this business and all they're trying to accomplish, that's an enormous problem, particularly given the debt load.  Some very basic stuff they should be doing...1) Actually adjust EBITDA (or some variation thereof) so the headline numbers have meaning -- LCM, RINs, one-time ERP, etc.; show what results would've been at like-for-like crude prices2) Focus investors on gross profit per barrel instead of margin (given sensitivity to crude); why the hell would you show a chart where Specialty margins look like they're collapsing?3) Lay out a path to $2X0M of Specialty EBITDA and show how you're going to get there (e.g., costs, pricing opportunities, mix, etc.); basically, show, numerically, the opportunity and hold yourself accountable, because NO ONE BELIEVES YOU ANYMORE4) Explain -- IN ADVANCE -- the timing, magnitude and effects of the turnaround activity5) Talk about how you're going to exit refining (and provide a time frame)6) Basically, assume investors are idiots (because most are) and assume they don't have access to all your internal information explaining the puts and takes to the numbers (because they don't)It would be great if Heritage could show support, but these are the same people who put Jennifer Straumins in charge, so I'm not particularly optimistic on that front.  I don't think providing space in their innovation center and paying a disproportionate share of Biosynthetics are sufficient at this point.",
Cause the gp wants to maintain control.  Same reason they keep a broken non distribution paying mlp structure.,
"Instead of selling the company off in parts, why don't they just sell off the company in its entirety? The market cap is now under $200M. Superior sold for over double this amount. It's just obvious that the market is punishing the valuation in light of the non-distribution paying MLP structure that management and Heritage have been stubbornly maintaining. If they couldn't pull off a turn around in three years of a predominantly raging bull market in stocks, what reason is there to believe they'll do so in a potential economic slowdown in the years ahead? The unit price reflects all of these uncertainties.",
"Lsv Being negative sounds nice in a market crash but everyone I knew who was negatIve and right in 08 stayed wrong for a long time after.  If you want to be negative get a borrow on clmt bonds.  The units at 2.40 have little juice left on the short side.No one would run San Antonio for a negative cash.  Shut it down, sell it, give it away.Great falls will be sold in next 2-4 years.  If you don’t think a refinance happens - short the bonds.  I would be long then bonds.",
Why the clmt bonds are a great buy.  Debt 1600 mil.Speciality chemicals - $200 mil. @ 8x = 1600 mil. Clmt bonds have asset coverage from just the speciality chemicals alone.  Now if clmt can convince the debt markets that it plans to generate cash and delever the credit story only gets better.  The question how does clmt roll the debt in a bad credit tape with credit market liquidity crisis.  This is a 2020 question.  1998 Asian crisis 1998 ltcm crisis2002 credit crisis 2008 Great Recession All these had liquidity crisis that lasted less than 12 months except 2008 recession which was 18 months.  So assume in 2019 credit markets are close - this will imply credit markets have been close since oct 2018 - 15 months.  In this world I expect in 2020 clmt will do a secured debt market deal.  Refinance all its debt with second and third lien bank debt.$1500 mil of debt ($100 cash build)- cash flow sweep- asset sale sweep - distribution restrictions This is very restrictive mechanism to refinance the balance sheet.  The secured creditors run the show. The tough case for clmt management and gp but at $2.40 who cares in the bond or unit holder world. This is my worst case scenario.  I don’t think it gets there but I also don’t think clmt just waits around will 2021 and gives the keys to the bond holders.  The bond market does not think clmt files for ch 11.  The units might behave distressed but the credit is not.  It is stressed 11 percent paper.  I expect the credit market stabilize in next 6 months.   The unit price makes little sense but then the gp thinks they can maintain a non distribution paying mlp for 5-6 years.,
Not sure clmt is buying bonds.   The bonds are very cheap in clmt.2021 - 872022- 852023 - 83This is not the price profile of a company that is going to file.  It credit market stress.  11 percent debt and equity is at 75 fcf yield.  Get the debt settled and the equity will move.,
"Clmt is a simple refinance and debt capital markets trade going forward.  Everything else Is kind of irrelevant.At $300 mil. Ebitda and $1.5 bil of debt (net adjusted for cash build) - 5x debt/ebitda levered.  Can it be refinanced yes - especially as it is a cash flow generating business and it has sellable assets - refineries.  My question is does anyone have an single example of where a non distribution paying mlp has raised significant debt or even equity capital?  Why I expect a c Corp conversion before approaching capital markets.  Clmt can do second lien bonds, second lien loans, straight unsecured bonds.I don’t think clmt can raise debt if it does not convince the debt markets it is serious about delevering.  Now it needs a credit market buy in to a delivering strategy",
Zerobid Looking closely.  The risk reward on 2021 is pretty good.  87-88 to get paid current carry and taken out in 7-9 months.For refinancing clmt needs Credit markets that are open A c Corp structure so there is no Cash leakAll free cash flow to pay down debt for next 5-8 years Cash on balance sheet and $500 mil raise could retire 2/3 of $900 issue.  Remainder can be reduced by free cash flow.  What remain roped with 2022 into new issue.  2023 addressed with asset sale,
When capital markets open up I expect clmt to finance part of 2021 bonds.  Could happen anytime after April when credit markets are liquid and open for financing again.,
87.25-88.25 today(12/17),
Lsv 87.87.25 on Friday,
What are the CUSP bond numbers for CLMT bonds?,
"blaser, what's the credit market looking like? I am increasingly hearing about quality spread widening out.",
MarkHow do you model clmt hedged position - close to 40 percent of crude is hedged.  Some of the hedges are exotic options/swaps on wcs versus distillates.,
I also would like clmt to focus their corporate presentation and investor relation pitch on sum of parts.  Breaking the company into speciality and refining and defining cap structure specifically on the two different parts of company.  Clmt will never gets its correct multiple as long as it owns both refining and speciality chemical assets in a combined form and it runs leverage higher than speciality chemical comps.,
"Finally, Calumet has a brand new modern website. The replaced website was comical,  vintage 90s. I often wondered where the attention to detail was, with broken links and out of date info. My kids create better websites from home, I often lamented. Now lets see if they can put some good qrts together in 2019, with better feed stock pricing, good diesel cracks, and lower capex and SG&A.www.calumetspecialty.com/...",
"Just to keep in context comparing Great Falls Refinery to Sturgeon Refinery in Alberta.Basically majority of the capital spent in Montana is brownfield and same time as Sturgeon.  So the $120k barrel comp to a refinery in Canada is spot on.In February, Calumet said the $400 million Montana refinery project, which includes the installation of a 20,000 b/d crude unit and a 25,000 b/d hydrocracker, will double the plant’s capacity and should be completed during first-quarter 2016 (OGJ Online, Feb. 21, 2014).The expansion project, which includes the construction of four processing units in total, is designed to increase the refinery’s low-sulfur fuels capacity to 30,000 b/d from its current 10,000 b/d, according to documents posted to DEQ’s web site.Additionally, the refinery would increase its yields of distillates, kerosene, diesel, and asphalt.The project is to include a crude unit to process heavy sour crudes, a mild hydrocracker unit (MHC) to convert gas oil to higher-value distillates, a hydrogen plant to support the MHC, and a fuel gas treatment unit to handle increased fuel gas production from the MHC, DEQ documents show.In its first-quarter 2014 filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, dated May 9, Calumet said the expansion project at the Montana refinery would allow the company to capitalize on local access to cost-advantaged heavy Canadian Bow River crude oil for an incremental product production slate of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and diluent to be sold into regional markets.",
ZerobidKoch are not an unlikely party.  They have a big bond trading arm and would probably buy the bonds in the public market prior to any deal.,
All the parties I see who can do a $900 second lien rescue financing Distressed/private equity Fortress KKRApollo Private Industry/strategic - all players in the chemical and refining space Access Industries KochBerkshire Public - sell whole company PsxHfc All major chemical companies - lyo hun ect Come 2020 all bonds can be called with under $20 make hold - change of control I think fehsenfeld will atleast run a sales process or get secured debt before turning the keys over to bond holders,
Lvs Also clmt does not have a debt due till 2021 - 24 months window.  Now I don’t expect clmt to wait till the end but I also don’t expect them to go running to file ch 11 next quarter either.  Lots of stuff good and bad can happen in 24 months.  The stock has already priced a horrific outcome.  The bonds have not.There are guys with 1/2 bil positions in clmt bonds.  At some point the gp will need to act - maybe they say $5 is fine we have taken enough earlier via distribution let’s sell clmt (maybe call buffett),
"At a minimum, you could sell the whole company today for $2B, which leaves $5.76 per share in equity value.The last thing in the world would be for management and the GP to turn over their equity to the bond holders in a restructuring.A year from now, if a refi at reasonable rates is not available, the company goes on the block.",
"Specialty EBITDA in the quarters from Q3 2014 to Q2 2015, which coincided with a collapse in oil prices, was $62.8m, $66m, $65.9m and $58.9m.  Not too shabby.Also, base oil cracks rebounded nicely in November per HFC.I agree, it is time for insiders to step up and buy some stock.  No excuse.",
LvsThe bonds are callable at par April 2019.I expect partial redemption.  The bond market is gappy - I have traded a ton of bonds.  They gap down and gap up.  Rating agencies matter for clmt as does if the large holders roll into new paper.The credit markets are terrible but they don’t stay terrible - they either get horrific (2008) or they get better.  They don’t stay in limbo for ever.  So either bonds go lower or the markets open up for refinance.  The equity is already at horrific.The 2022 and 2023 will be addressed with asset sales.The 2021 are ones that need to be rolled near term.  It’s all credit going forward - everything else is irrelevant,
Lsv At $2.66 clmt is a survival option.  If debt can be refinanced this will be much higher.  At $87.50 the bonds are stressed but they are still a credit story not a restructuring story.  These bonds could be refinanced for par in 2019,
Lsv Macro is tough.  Most guys who do company specific don’t do macro and vice versa  For diesel wcs spreads - look at clmt hedges - they have thought thru how these two interact - I give them credit for it Going thru clmt hedges wcs exposure is not 100 percent - a nice chunk is hedged,
"LsvI have been too bullish on clmt.  I expected it to convert to a c Corp and delever into a speciality chemical company by 2022 with a stock price between $15-$20.Going forward I am looking a clmt as being a $6-$9 stock and the time horizon being 2024-2025.  The path will be longer.  I expect clmt to refinance part of its balance sheet with secured second lien debt.  The second lien debt will be the core driver of corporate and capital market actions thru it’s covenants.  I think they second lien in 2019-2020.  I expect Clmt will sell its refining assets - Montana refinery in  2021-2022 timeframe.  The proceeds will pay down debt.  Clmt will be forced into a c Corp conversion not by choice but by secured debt covenants and tax shield running out.  2019 they should make 50-75 mil in free cash.  Wcs Canadian regulatory stuff in 1q will result in relative pain.  I think the gp and to some degree the management will lose control over clmt.  Clmt faith will largely be decided by restrictions and covenants in the new refinanced debt.   The upside is if credit markets open and rating agencies are receptive and clmt can access unsecured markets.  I agree I think refining has started to matter much more.  The question is does the credit market buy into Jan wcs differential as being an abnormality.  Cause 4q 2018, 2q2019 number will be good.  1q 2019 may not comp as well based on Jan wcs.  Cash flows will paydown some debt but interest expense will eat into cash flows.",
A secured deal would suck for the mlp structure as debt would have very restrictive covenants I see clmt easily being able to a do a $750-$850 second lien deal The back end debt will be addressed via asset sales Ect What management needs to do is tell the debt markets - end goal is to be a 2 times levered speciality chemical business.  Everything till them is focused on debt reduction - free cash flow sweeps and refining asset sales,
Lsv The bonds are 87.25-87.50 - stressed yes but end of world no. Management has only one thing to do - refinance the debt.  Everything thing is irrelevant.  Stock will do fine if debt is refinanced.  4q will be okay 1q will be weaker as Jan wcs is bid up.  2q 3q 4q wcs differential is above $20 West will get the debt rolled - a secured deal at $3 stock works but unsecured is better,
Maybe after it hits all time lows the gp and fehsenfeld wake up and realize that being an orphaned mlp is not the best decision regardless of what they think the idr is worth,
"From the y who built the sturgeon refinery in Alberta - $120k a barrel.  MacGregor says he understands the criticism that Alberta has historically been a high-cost jurisdiction for building multi-billion-dollar energy projects, but there are fewer and fewer realistic alternatives every year as new export pipelines keep getting delayed.“It’s cheaper to build in China but I can’t get bitumen to China. It might be cheaper to build on Mars, too,” he said.Everything happening in Alberta shows the underlying asset value of Montana Refinery.

It's l sad to realize how wrong you've been on a MLP like this one.  I got way too excited on Calumet after their success in 2016 and early 2017, and really drank the Kool-Aid on this one.

Anyone at the cowen or wells Fargo conferences.  Rumor is that there was a self made industry (refining) billionaire who attended regular on the run investor meetings (one on one)  with clmt.,
The wcs differential spread goes from $11 in Jan to $14/$15 in Feb to $15/16 in March to $20 plus in April and stays above $20 for rest of 2019.$20 wcs differential is sustained by rail transport costs to get to gulf refineries with complexity to process wcs.  The rail differential times 25k barrels a day added for end products (asphalt ect) is the value for Montana.  The replacement cost of Montana to build would be significant ($3 bil).Other  refining output is associated to speciality chemical assets.,
"From a Bloomberg story “Everyone is bidding up those barrels to make sure they can cover their pipe space,” Mike Walls, a Genscape analyst, said by phone. “People are really just hyper-focused on January and that’s why you are seeing these dramatic price moves.”The futures are 1q show a $20 plus wcs differential.Alberta is buying railcars and wants to get investors to build a new refinery.Last refinery in Alberta cost $120k a barrel.  At that price Montana is worth $3 bil. On replacement value.  The person who built the last Alberta refinery said it would have been easier to build it on Mars.The real value of Montana is Canadian wcs producer.  Wcs producers need to be integrated.The cost to ship to gulf is $20 a barrel.  That is where the steady state spread should be until some massive pipeline infrastructure is built.Clmt has $580-$600 mil in Montana - I think eventually they will get paid their capital in - May be in 2020 or 2023 or 2025",
Only someone living in fantasy land expects  wcs differentials to be at 40-50 forever.  Psx who is one of the largest refiner of wcs told analyst at its analyst dinner it expects wcs differentials to be at 20 plus over time.  Futures pointing at 20 plus too.  What wcs differential vol shows is that anyone undertaking the high cap ex to  produce it should also own high cap ex assets (refining) to process it,
"Hey guys.  WCS differential was down to $11 yesterday and I heard down to $9.  I doubt that it can stay that low, but that differential at $40-$50 was what was going to give CLMT the free cash flow to deliver next year.  I see close to zero free cash flow in the next 12 months without some kind of dramatic change.",

"We spoke to two credit hedge funds (active in HY and distressed) that we are close to. They don't see any issue for CLMT to refinance their bonds, since they are not CCC rated anymore. It is not a question of if they can refinance, just to what terms they do it. One analyst believes they are likely to refinance the bond in a secured term loan with a similar coupon than the bonds. Refinancing the bonds now, would likely mean that they need to yield 10% (also implied by the market currently).",
For my money - I would shoot for $100M cash on hand and apply the rest to buying 2021 bonds at this nice discount. So $35M to build cash balance and $35M-ish to buy $40M of bonds saves $650K per quarter of interest going forward. If we assume +$40M quarterly FCF from there with half going to bonds and half to cash reserves they end 2019 with close to $200M in the bank and $120M-$130M less debt (and saving over $2M/quarter in interest expense making it easier to produce that cash flow). This would leave $780M on the 2021 issue - with a full year and $200M in the bank you should have options. The 2022 and 2023 issues are only $350M and $325M each so not nearly the problem the $900M due 2021. All together they are the bulk of outstanding debt.,
They need to show some decent cash accumulation this quarter. Appreciate the work on the article and keeping the convo going.,

You put a great deal of work into surmising what could happen. The fact is nothing has happened for years and CLMT is a lousy holding. They lied about the distribution cut (to zero) and keep saying we are getting there. I’m not impressed.,
"Thanks for the article! They have substantial Midland hedges for 4Q, which are above 4Q market price. This positively impacts the 12k barrel by pipeline calculation.",
The market doesn't believe in the company but I'm sticking with it.  They need to cut the debt before any distribution starts. I own the debt and it has fallen faster than the stock.,
"I have done a similar analysis and came up with $49 MM of cash flow from OPS after subtracting $20 MM of capex, but without any adjustment for inventory reduction. If I add back the $25 MM you assumed for reduction in inventory, the positive cash flow is $74 MM, close to your $80 MM number. Of course, there are many moving parts, LCM, RIN, unplanned shut down, etc. Or I could just be way off with some assumptions. My 2019 numbers look encouraging as well. With the hedges in place, hopefully the CF in fuel will be less volatile. Like you said in the last article, CLMT has to execute. If they do execute,  we may see a re-start of a distribution in mid to late 2020.",
"Nice piece, good Balance of Subjective, Objective, and Speculation information, I'm not a fan, earlier SA Article on execution hits the root causes for me, I think they'll go sub $3 in December ...",

"Interesting comment from an employee on glassdoor:""I cannot stress this enough. Be very wary of any opportunity for growth in this company if you are in Technology. Due to continued declining revenues from its Telecom business, the company has made a strategic decision to shift its software development overseas. This process has been happening for well over a year. We have seen our scrum teams grow in sizes from 7-8 members to well over 15 people, with half of them from overseas. The economic reasons for this is hard to refute. For the salary of a state-side developer, you can get 2.5 developers overseas.Morale at this company is at an all-time low. A major reason for this is that upper management have started using performance reviews as a tool to justify laying off of higher paid employees. For the last 4 quarters, there is a steady process of laying off US-based employees, with replacements coming from overseas. Many of IDT's brightest talents have already left.Senior management is playing a very risky game. On the one hand, they need to reduce costs. However, they are already running into the risk of losing their domain knowledge experts--many who have already left the company. At some point...you will end up with a telecom / fintech company that collapses under itself due to absence of technical domain expertise.If you are considering a technical job at IDT, I would tell you that you will learn a lot. But don't expect to be around for more than one or two years. I would expect the footprint of the technology department on the US-side to be very small over the next 2 years---mostly technical leaders managing the workload of the offshore resources.""",

Anyway, I think shorting a company with no debt, buying back stock, trading at around 4X EV/EBITDA, and being run by a founding family with a history of creating significant value for stockholders is a very risky bet. As for the calling card business, I think everyone knows this business is in secular decline, including management. This is why the stock is trading at such a low valuation. However, the company is investing the cash flow from the declining business into new businesses, which have been growing, and which all have great long-term potential (e.g. money transfer and unified communication). The stock has gone up since the last quarter for various reasons. Bottom line is that the company  doesn't need to show much success for the stock to keep going up from here, given the already low expectations baked into the valuation.",

"WAB is Westinghouse Air Brake. George Westinghouse invented the air brake used on trains.In my opinion, this deal vaults WAB into the S & P Index & is a great deal for WAB stockholders- especially at current prices.An interesting aside. WAB is headquartered in Wilmerding, PA. This is a small suburb of Pittsburgh and no place you would ever expect a corporate headquarters.Their Corporate H.Q. used to be the 'castle""; a building exactly as the name describes. (I have not been back in over 60 years, so am ignorant as to their current H.Q.)Just some background...",
Certainly such cash flow was not reported in GE’s financials. I think someone is looking at numbers not revealed to the rest of us or even known to the Wabtec company. I think your shooting match associates are either incorrect or have another motive for giving you these “facts”.,

This article seems to conclude the opposite, I personally don’t believe the deal particularly was beneficial to GE. The transportation business is very profitable, the software that GE has to maximize operating efficiency of its fielded locomotives is the best in the industry. The idea that diesel locomotives will not be bought in the foreseeable future is not reasonable. GE was building the factory of the future in India and just announced the development of as electrically powered locomotive and the first sale to a commercial entity in Turkey of four diesel locomotives. The business appears to be run by qualified managers who understand that servicing of an extensive fielded base is a source of continuous business. The same can’t be said for the management of power or oil and gas.

They are also 3 compelling reasons to buy the stock.“In the remainder of 2018 and for the full-year of 2019, we expect license revenue to continue to grow due to the increased numbers of installations from both new and established customers and recurring revenue from the licensing business.”“To reiterate, over the next 15 months, we can expect continued sequential growth in license revenue due to our recurrent revenue model with occasional outsized spurts in license revenue growth due to larger than usual orders.”“...we think the stock price is undervalued given what we see happening with the company in terms of our growth.”",
"Nice write-up, Boris. I think you underestimate the upside here, in part due to your reliance upon revenue multiples that are designed for high-growth, unprofitable companies. SMLR is recurring revenue, high growth and profitable with a $1.00 run-rate EPS... a P/E of 28. Take a 50% top-line grower with 89% gross margin, nominal marketing costs and largely fixed overhead and you have a recipe for continued rapid EPS growth. That is the beauty and broad appeal of this stock.Their marketing costs are nominal because United Health and (I think) Humana are buying these devices for their network docs and home risk assessment groups. Why?  Because it's good for the patient and necessary for insurers under scrutiny for overbilling Medicare Advantage with low quality claims.  Insurers are under immense pressure to replace whatever garbage they have historically used to game Medicare Advantage payments with better clinical evidence to warrant higher reimbursement. I believe this is what is driving sales and SMLR is still in just a couple of groups at United Health and just one at Humana... it is still early. And this is a one product company where rest assure mgmt is looking at other areas to enter and leverage these relationships and model.Organically, SMLR should earn close $2.00 per share in 2020.

"Post from BiotechInvestor1 on Investors Hub“Helen mentioned at least four times that the reason behind PFS taking longer than anticipated had to do with censoring. It is not only possible but quite likely that the control patients switched treatments more often and earlier than the pegpH20 patients. Therefore, any of control patients’s subsequent progressions beyond the 14 days after last dose of placebo was censored and not counted as progression. Because of this censorship, the control group may have appeared to have (erroneously) longer PFS. I know they say they are blinded but we know they have clues (side effects like muscle aches and edema) as to which patients are getting Peg vs. placebo. Sensing this counterproductive potential higher or at least equivalent PFS among control group, halo proactively dumped PFS interim analysis. It is actually a smart move. ”Reply from JamTomorrow2“So basically what she’s saying is that the PFS numbers will yet again be messy - just as they were from the Phase 2 trial. You’d have thought that they would have learned how to address this problem after the Phase 2 fiasco but apparently not. The thing that’s difficult to grasp is that she seems to be saying that it’s the control arm that’s producing longer than expected PFS numbers caused by patients coming off PEG and going onto new treatments. If that’s correct surely that’s really bad for PEG - coming off it and going onto different drugs and subsequently coming up with higher than expected PFS numbers is surely bad for PEG. You’d logically think that if those control arm patients were followed through to death then their OS numbers would be higher than PEG. But I suspect that those patients’ OS data will be eliminated from the control arms’ OS numbers so as to make the PEG numbers look better. I can see the FDA issuing a CRL and demanding yet another trial as basically it’s all HALO’s fault for their very sloppy Phase 3 trial design. Helen could find herself out of a job for this mess. “",
"I appreciate that but each new PEG combination drug will require big Phase 3 trials, which as we know take years.  So HALO is always years behind the new standard of care drug.  They need to get PEG approved in its own right so that it can immediately be added to the new drug for high HA patients.  I guess this will probably happen in ten years time but in the meantime huge amounts of potential business will be lost.",
"Pentech, nice to hear from you again.Halozyme has a deal with Roche where Genentech is studying Tecentriq with PEGPH20 in 8 tumor types, including pancreas.  HALO just supplies the enzyme, Roche pays for the studies.  And if PEGPH20 succeeds in 301, even if it is just 2 or 3 months, the makers of all the other compounds will want to run studies in combo with PEGPH20 to get an advantage.  Halo won't be paying for any of it, just like the Genentech deal with Tecentriq.Abraxane added just 2 months to Gemcitabine for pancreas cancer, and it is now standard of care.  Baby steps is all there is with PC.",
Not at all.  If a new PC drug say has OS of 15 months then PAG is out of business.  Of course PEG may help the new drug to an get even longer OS in high HA patients but it would take years for that combination to get approved.  Get it now?,
Are you clients making any money yet on their HALO investments?  Not many people are at the moment.Interestingly your article neatly spells out the big risk on PEGPH20 namely that the expected benefit is likely to just be a few months of extra life.  That makes any serious breakthrough from a better competitive drug a killer for HALO.  HALO has to get all their PEGPH20 combination drugs approved separately rather than just getting PEHPH20 approved in isolation.  This means that each combination drug will take maybe 5 years to get approved at vast expense.  HALO has already spent hundreds of millions on PEGPH20.  Every time a new competitive drug gets approved is a threat to HALO.  Sure they could maybe combine with that new drug but that would involve further trials and costs as mentioned above.  HALO is therefore always up to 5 years behind the curve.  They need to get PEGPH20 approved in its own right - maybe they will eventually but that won’t be for years.  In the meantime this huge investment in PEG is looking very risky to me.  And then finally how much will insurers be willing to pay for an extra 2 months of life.  HALO seems to be indicating a lot - but are saying that with no surefire knowledge that they are right.Anyway thanks for your article.  I’m still almost as confused as most of the analysts sounded after having their questions answered in the recent CC.  To me the problem was that the PFS data from the Phase 2 trial was unbelievably messy.  It appears that they have learned nothing from this when setting the Phase 3 protocol.  It’s pretty clear reading between the lines that the Phase 3 PFS data will be a mess too.  I don’t buy your statement of the double blinded trial means nobody knows what’s going on on PFS.  The patients taking the PEG versions suffer a lot of AEs so it should be possible to have a good guess as to who’s on PEG.  That enabled someone to work out that the PFS data was messy and not as convincing as the FDA would require.  So let’s switch to OS and hope that works better.  Don’t get me wrong I’m a big long term investor in HALO.  But I’m not quite as convinced as you that all is rosy on PEG.  I’m also somewhat concerned about the fact that with HALO commencing discussions with the FDA on switching the Primary Endpoint in August it is disturbing to see how many shares RJ Kirk has disposed of since then.  The same RJ Kirk who when resigning as Chairman a few months early said ‘he intended to retain his ownership position’.  Makes you wonder eh!,
"Thank you, Avisol.Some investors like PEGPH20 but almost all investors very much like the ENHANZE program. The combination is destroying visibility on the value of Halozyme.A lot of ENHANZE fans are really scared that management will use the proceeds of ENHANZE for R&D programs that won't be successful. Do you know why RJ Kirk sold part of his shares this summer?",
"Since PFS no longer provides timeline advantage, the company decides to shift all alpha to OS data point, which makes OS more likely to succeed. A smart move.",Halozyme: Explaining The Change In Trial Design
And now DBVT is out of the race.  endpts.com/...,
Anyone know where u can access detailed information on results on DBVTs latest test results from PEPITES phase III study?  DBVT website has data stating 62.6 % of Viaskin subjects increase Eliciting Dose compared to 28% of placebo group after 12 months of treatment.  If 28% responded to a placebo and 32% receiving Viaskin did not respond does seem the effects is limited. Very little info re size of study   Study involved 31 test centers in 5 countries. Difference between test group and placebo reached a high level of significance but the 3 paragraphs describing it on website don’t provide much detail. If the results are so good why not provide more details?  DBVT stock jumped 10% last week likely related  to Dec 12 press release following conference in Vienna.,
Appreciate the article & clearing up any doubts about safety one might have.  No drug or treatment will be 100% effective but AIMT will be the first to market in the peanut allergy space in an unmet medical need which is very attractive.,

The ""drug"" here is simply peanut protein extract, easy to copy and dirt cheap to manufacture.    The IP, for what it is worth,  relates to how precise the purity is, and the precision of the quantity of the protein in each dose.2.  All of the revenue and profit estimates are based on a pricing model which seems to have not been subject to much critical scrutiny. I also believe that both AIMT and DBVT will do OK.  (Currently I have a modest position in DBVT, which I hope will become less modest.)",

"Thanks Keith for an excellent article. It is nice to see a reasoned, fact-based summary.",
The market is plenty big for both.,
"All of the AIMT longs should give serious thought as to why Baker Brothers, Perceptive Advisors and Deerfield own over 11 million DBVT. What is the quality of the background research these firms have access to? Why has Joseph Edelman increased his DBVT stake over 80 percent since PEPITES trial result? There is perception that determines share price in the short term and reality that ultimately determines long term share price. DBVT safety profile is far superior to AIMT and therefore will capture the majority of the peanut allergy market. AR 101 side effects are not insignificant particularly when considering that children are the ones being treated. Safety and ease of use wins in the pediatric population",
"The market is large because parents worry about their children in school, etc. Epipens are constantly lost, must be stored in certain ways and need frequentl replacement.

Everyone at work were using Apple boxes and we also printed books and posters for Apple Computer. Forty years of talking to Apple employees, I was always impressed with their intelligence and need to make everything better than ever before–stretching human ability to the max. I'm writing this on a 2011 MacBook Pro, my most used computer.   I first bought $300 of Apple at $13/s, it rose and split. I sold it as it dropped to $114. When it dropped to $23, I went all in with $35,000. It split x2 and x7. Unfortunately, I lost 1/2M trading in other stocks in the sideways market of 2009.

For those of you who believe that Android will win the day, go buy whatever stock you think covers that bet. Just skip the old tired arguments that we've heard since Windows 95 was going to kill the Mac (spoiler alert--it didn't) and recognize that the iPhone isn't going away (and that you can buy one for any price point from $450 (for a new still-being-sold iPhone 7) to $1,450 (for the top-of-the-line XSMax.)

"Sadly, most of the currently traded Apple stock is with investors who weren't around when Apple went through their last problematic periods. It almost went down before and Jobs was really a savings grace after no one else was willing or able to lead it out of the wasteland last time. Management is still good at keeping numbers up and running Apple, but really, it needs a innovator. Right now, it is really just milking users and selling its user base for cash. This is a good way to make money but not a structural way to keep growing just like Facebook should realize by now.Apple's stock price is already quite low and the company has a massive hoard of money, so they should do fine for now. However, there is longer term cause for concern. This is especially the case as Microsoft is on the move again. Remember, they were the ones who almost killed Apple before. No one talks about how much Apple still pays Microsoft for Office. Thus, Google helps Apple much more than people think being a counterbalance to Microsoft. They should think long and hard about bilking Google and taking them for granted in the future.",

You just need *an* iPhone and need those services.As long as people who use iOS (and MacOS) keep using iOS (and MacOS) and the services Apple designs are wanted by those users demand for services will increase. And Apple’s platforms are extremely sticky, most users not even considering the possibility of switching to alternative platforms.Many new users at the margin purchase used phones and tablets, and many old users keep their devices longer (especially tablets) and this results in stagnant unit sales, but it does not translate in less service sales. In fact used devices are letting people gain access to Apple service platform that would otherwise not be able to afford.",

I've long felt that Wall Street types simply do not understand this stock, and it makes me wonder how well they understand ANY company that is more about psychology and ""stickiness"" (as marketing types would call it) than unit sales.

Apple is so much more than units units units, and has actually done BETTER under Tim Cook than under the far-more-charismatic Steve Jobs, as those like me who bought nearly 30 years ago know.Every time Apple drops, I think ""Maybe I should lighten up on it"", but I never get around to putting in a sell order.

"Now Nvidia is at 130! Down from 290 in Oct. 55% of value shaved off in a jiffy. Countless licking their wounds. The quantum of decline is un-nerving as is the ferocious pace of decline. In a matter of 10 to 11 weeks. Who is to say that this scale of momentum will not take it below 100? Of course, at that point its valuation will be too cheap to ignore. As long as the business thesis of Nvidia is not broken, it would make a great buy at 110-100. That would account for any cyclical downturn facing semis, crypto-bust and the somewhat cagey behaviour of Nvidia management.I enjoyed this article esp. your thought experiment on valuation.

"China's exports are 18% of their GDP and the US gets 18% of those exports, multiplying to 3.5% of Chinese GDP going to US exports. Even assuming 25% across the board tariffs, how much of this 3.5% goes away and how much goes to other countries to have ""Made in Vietnam"" labels printed and attached and then reshipped to the US? How does the drop in that 3.5% compare to ongoing Chinese GDP growth of 6.5%? While such 25% across the board tariffs could have huge impacts on individual companies (such as AAPL, WMT) the math to a recession for China doesn't add up. Conclusion: the Chinese bear market is more likely to be an opportunity to be greedy when others are fearful than an actual trap. Scenarios include Trump's troubles sinking him before he can do more damage, the House + Senate diminishing his tariff power, as well as new leadership in 2020 ending this whole nonsense, not to mention what happened in other situations - small concessions by the Chinese and declaring ""victory in the trade war"" with the usual PR BS.",

"@StockUS_Patty -  Hi Patty - It appears there is at least a 90 day detent' of no new tariffs. This tells me exactly what I thought would take place. This will be good for the market for at least until the first of the year and probably well into the first quarter.If towards the end of the year or the beginning of the new year, the detent' appears to be going sour, you might be wise to pull some of your investment out of equities and put it back in safe harbor. There is no doubt that the market will stabilize. The question remains will the current 10% tariff remain indefinitely? This would protract stabilization over a longer time frame. If tariffs go the default rate of 25% (which I think is unlikely even if negotiations fall apart) it will probably take even longer for the markets to stabilize. I believe short of a Sino-American trade resolution the 10% tariff will remain.During this time I would suggest you look at some of the investment scenarios I presented to you off line. Bear in mind, I suggest very importantly, that you establish a sensible cash management plan, holding what you feel is a reasonable level of cash on hand. The cash on hand is an important factor because it protects what you can't afford to lose and places it in a relative safe harbor if things go wrong. On the positive side, the cash reserve can be used as a reserve that you can add to if your finances permit as well as provides the means to double down so to speak on one of your best investments if the market appears to have settled down later.The settled down later aspect we won't know about until later and depends upon how international trade relations unfold and how prior downward economic pressures with China/South American/European/Australian respond to the G20 summit.One thing the G20 meeting serves well is it is a common ground where the world trading giants can work out problems as it seems to have done successfully this time at least short term.The 3 news sources I linked below all seem to point firmly in the direction of at least temporary detent'.

"I really don't know about this methodology of identifying a good entry point based on a year ago comparison, using 1 year ahead numbers. Does the market really only look ahead a year? Does it hold margins constant in assigning multiples to those forward sales and earnings at a cyclical peak for the underlying product? I think one can try a number of different approaches to valuation and get a number of different answers out. The risk is that of confirmation bias - if we already like a stock and badly want to say it is cheap now, let's buy more, we stop after we have found one such approach that says it is time to buy. Instead of using a number of other approaches and looking at the different things they are saying, stress testing our margin assumptions, and buying when there is a significant margin of safety even to kind of bad assumptions. For example, what if the glut of GPUs is real and lasts 3-4 quarters instead of 1-2? What if in 2 years Amazon and others have a lot of competing products? How does the impact on margin, both the next 3-4 quarters and in years 3,4,5...affect the long-term value of the business? In terms of long-term investing, the biggest mistakes made seem to be in margin assumptions (how they hold up and for how many years) as well as how long rapid growth rates can last. I have seen people, with a straight face, put up high growth rates for companies that last so long that it implies they end up with over 100% market share, given agreed upon growth rates for the industry as a whole. There seems to be a lot of risk in any kind of modeling a firm like this over a 5-10 year horizon. Therefore, the only way to approach it at a cyclical peak is with a great deal of caution.",

"@Kwan-Chen Ma   I would argue there is another component to consider:  Investor Sentiment.  Though the future is difficult to quantify, as a long term observer I would comment that periodic waxes and wanings can have sustained impact.   Semis as a group had a long ride up, NVDA as the poster child for potential got slapped (as I pointed out in my blog) for overzealousness.   Now the luster on the entire segment has worn a bit thin and may take some time to rebuild.  NVDA is going to be range bound for a bit, imo -- a few quarters to get back on track.   But until there is some nice catalyst in data center or automotive, I think slow and steady should be the expectation.   The market posture seems a bit more in a ""show me"" mode for semis at the moment, I don't see that breaking until well into next year.I agree $145 is a good entry, my sense is it will come around again though.   Over the long term it isn't really going to matter if it's $145 or $165.  This company hasn't lost any of the growth drivers it had two months ago, just the high valuation, so certainly this is a good opportunity for initiating a position for the long term.",
"Mr. Ma, interesting approach to evaluate NVDA. I believe semis are in the downside of the cycle, but I welcome seeing things from all sides.  Thank you.",
"Clearly the market is anticipating that Nvidia has gone from a phase of outperforming expectations to a phase of underperforming expectations. 2017 was excitement building and 2018 has been disappointment building. The forward looking financials as of today are worthless if things actually get worse then anyone expects.This is also symptomatic of what's going in the broader market. Crowded momentum trades are unwinding rapidly as they've exhausted new buyers. The story of nvidia has been known for years but after a dramatic correction in tech, there just isn't enough new and emerging excitement around the story to bring new investors to the table. Easier to wait and see how things play out. Nvidia is almost certainly going to remain relevant for the next couple decades absent all major tech companies creating better in-house chips somehow, but chasing dead cat bounces on a falling knife is scary.

"KC - I agree $NVDA is seriously oversold. I disagree with Jensen's statement during conference call. He blamed the channel overstock on ""crypto hangover"". He added, This is not quoting him here, I saying figuratively he said $NVDA believed retail prices at the pump complicated the channel issue because GPU MSP, remained higher than predicted MSP didn't drop until months later adding to the hangover.My contention is yes, some of the channel inventory was/is due to crypto hangover. I also believe Jensen used the ""crypto hangover"" as a coverup for the fact that $AMD took a bigger market share of his business in the gaming sector than he is willing to accept, because at the end of the crypto cycle competing high end Vega GPUs were selling at nearly half the price. A fact that he didn't want to admit publicly. (I'm not sure of the half price realize Vega does sell for much less.)Any way I'm just as disappointed as every other long $NVDA investor about the ridiculous low share price. If I weren't already fully loaded with $NVDA stock I would be buying more while it's on sale.At the same time I can't complain because I bought the bulk of my shares early in 2016 and I'm still close to 200% unrealized ROI. $NVDA is a great stock that I will be holding at least for another 2 to 3 years.

"Great article again and thanks for posting.  Do not have a position in NVDA and it was my belief that NVDA had entered a ""range bound trading range"" similar to what AMD had to endure for over 2 years while trading between $9 and $15.  Did not expect this drastic of a reduction in share price in NVDA.  Still the stock has run from ~$25 in 2015 to over $150 today.  That is an impressive run.  IMHO the main driver of NVDA decline was the poor performance boost from Turing and the HUGE price increase for the small gains.  NVDA started the drastic price drop on October 03 well before AMD 3Q18 ER showed that there was actually going to be a crypto hangover.  NVDA had been priced to perfection (just like AMD was when it was trading at ~$32).  The perfection started to evaporate when TSLA said they were dropping NVDA chips for self driving cars.  Autonomous vehicles suddenly started killing people and that took the perfection off that TAM.  Hyper scalers started talking about creating their own chips to do specific work better than a CPU or a GPU.  AMD Zen Architecture actually started to cut into TAM of both INTC and NVDA in the last year reducing the possibility of perfection.  The final hammer blow that shattered the perfect jewel that was NVDA stellar price was the failure of management to prepare the market for the possibility of headwinds.  In 2Q18 ER NVDA projected for ~$100 million in crypto sales and instead delivered only $18 million.  This means that the glut of inventory that NVDA will need a few months to clear has been a known issue since 2Q18 ER and NVDA hid that fact from investors.  IMHO it was the failure of NVDA management to prepare the market for the news that has driven the stock to current levels and will probably drive the share price to below $125 (which is my target price for a possible entry on this stock).  Disclaimer long AMD and short INTC no position in NVDA.",

Interesting take.At what price would you add to your position?,
NVDA is still trading at much higher P/S multiple as compared to AMD and Intel. This was justified when revenues were growing 40% YoY. This has now slowed to 25%. NVIDIA revenues will no longer grow by double digit by next few quarters. AMD is a better investment. However AMD too has serious headwinds in 2019. Only by 2021 will its revenues again grow by 25%.,

"Intel is the semi stock to invest in, for the reasons I list below (in organized bullet points, with links to support every assertion). However, do not expect anything to happen quickly. Stocks move up based on two things: (1) hype (dangerous because this can be an illusory move meaning it's the rise before a massive crash, like what happened to AMD the last few months) or (2) real tangible information. Right now Intel is getting crushed by negative hype as people are saying it will never be able to do 10nm. Once that's crushed with tangible proof that it's mass producing 10nm, it'll shoot up. The lack of a CEO is largely unimportant though, as Intel is effectively an amalgam of many subsidiaries and each sub has an effective leader right now.I. On Intel's (INTC) ""failure"" to move to 10nm• Intel is shipping its 10nm chips in Lenovo and NUC computers right now.

But this shows you that AMD is still more than 2 years behind Intel in per-core performance -- because Rome won't be released until mid-2019 and the Xeon 8180s were released mid-2017. So 64 mid-2019 AMD cores are equal to 56 (2x28) mid-2017 Intel cores. www.servethehome.com/...• Incidentally, Lisa Su knew exactly how much power the Rome chip pulled on the above demo, but she refused to disclose that information.• The Rome chip has a gigantic and wasteful 14nm die in the middle that does zero processing but sucks power.

On security. You may have read reports of University Scientists occasionally find extremely complicated and difficult-to-implement security weaknesses in Intel chips (spectre and so on). This is a huge benefit for customers who buy Intel. These scientists search Intel for security weaknesses because -- if they find one -- they can publish a paper, get their name in the news, get something on their resume and so on. They're effectively acting as Intel's free security workforce, finding things for Intel to patch. Other chip manufacturers don't have this, because you can only get in the news if you find a weakness in an Intel chip, because it dominates the market.X. On political and trade risk. AMD has huge political and market share risk due to a JV that allows Chinese companies to sell Epyc clones. The history is below.• In August 2015, the U.S. barred Intel (and implicitly AMD) from selling high-end server chips to a few (but not all) Chinese customers due to national security concerns. Intel complied. www.pcworld.com/...• A few months later, China went to Lisa Su to get basically the same chip from AMD via a complicated joint venture that complied with the letter of the law -- because the chip would not be sold by a U.S. company but would rather be sold by the Chinese JV (so no need to ask the U.S. for permission to export it to Chinese customers). www.forbes.com/...• A month ago, China started producing these Epyc server chip clones. As this article explains, they have a different name but are EXACTLY Epyc chips. www.tomshardware.com/...• The U.S. government is due to publish a report on Chinese theft of U.S. semiconductor IP that could name and shame AMD. ""ASSESSMENT OF THE U.S. INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY"" www.reddit.com/...• Based on the timing, it's clear the ONLY reason this JV was set up was to circumvent the government's ban.• These chips will be in the hands of those very customers the U.S. government said couldn't have them. In October 2018, China announced the first supercomputer using these clone chips. www.top500.org/...• These chips will take market share from Epyc, with AMD getting a tiny royalty instead of the large margins it would have made on Epyc.",

"Nice bullish INTC article.  Like the fact that author admits that 6 months without a CEO could be a head wind.  Author also admits that 10 nm production problems could be problematic.  What Author doesn't talk about are INTC two main competitors -  AMD and TSMC.  AMD has new architecture for CPU that helps alleviate Moores laws problems of molecular scale.  AMD EPYC servers are projected to reach 5% of very lucrative server market in 2018 (from less than 1%) and mid double digits (and past INTC CEO BK said ""try and hold AMD to only 15%-20% server share, before he was fired in June) by 2020.  TSMC is in production of 7 nm wafers which are comparable to INTC 10nm which means that INTC has lost one of their major moats.  INTC spends huge amounts on R&D and so far the company only seems to be able to increase profits and revenues through acquisitions rather than innovation.  Finally, INTC went from $28 to $56 and back to $47 from 2016 to present while AMD went from $3 to $34 and back to $21 at present. NVDA has gone from $25 to $290 and back to $150 at present.  The breakouts in tech have already happened.  Saying that  INTC is ready for a break out while sector is consolidating implies that INTC will lead the sector out of problems.  INTC can't solve their own problems so how can they lead the sector out of problems?  Disclaimer long AMD, short INTC and no position in NVDA.",

"I would like a dollar for every article I have read the last few years about how undervalued Apple shares are. Every time AAPL has a big product launch the shares rise, then they collapse within 12 months or so because the market isn't buying  a growth story. This time the counter argument is the growth of services and the ecosystem. It is a decent argument but the market isn't buying it. A PE under 15 is not a growth company. The flaw in the services story is that it assumes the future of services is divorced from the number of devices sold. Services are being sold to owners of Apple devices. If that stagnates then everything will eventually stagnate. It also is a fact that AAPL is not alone in selling these services. FB jumped in by buying Instagram. AAPL was sidestepped in acquiring YouTube. Now Spotify is where to be in music. I am wary when articles assume the market is wrong. Usually it turns out the market is right. The fact is people are unwilling to pay more for AAPL. Until AAPL demonstrates faster growth overall, it will be accorded a poor share price. Not just a bump up after a product launch with higher margins, but unit growth. I am out of AAPL for now. The roller coaster has gone over the hill and the stock is where it was a year ago.",

Apple is expensive if it's only going to grow at 5%,
Really looking forward to a stock split one day; hopefully in the near future..,
apple services do not deserve the P/E expansion. Apple services work only on Apple devices. Apple devices are less than 15% of the total device pool. That implies there will be powerful rivals in services catering to 85% non-Apple crowd.,
"I honestly think their next golden egg will be the watch. There were lines and the watches were sold out. Many friends/colleagues of mine bought watches for their senior relatives. The new iPad will use USB instead of FireWire mini. If that’s any indication that they will change the port for iPhone 11, that may pique interests from mobile users outside of the Apple ecosystem. Last, maybe customers are waiting for 5G phones. I know I’m holding out with 2 iPhones (6 and 6S). I really didn’t like that the EarPods share the same port as the FireWire cable AND I am waiting for 5G.Hopefully, Apple gets rid of those lines.

"Think about it - Apple services business compare well to that of FB (total) in terms of Revenue. However, it is higher margin and growing at a similar rate.

The services projections seem a bit rosy over the next 5 years but I do like Apple here.  I am now convinced that the Apple watch along with other wearables related to health is underestimated.

Maybe I will make an article of it tomorrow.,

If app developers revolt against the 30% App Store tax and Apple already had to make that 15% for subscriptions, why artists should behave differently?I guess it is strange to think of services as income sources. Yes, Apple users may increase their spending, but without iPhone sales, and clearly UNIT sales this time, there will be no services.Services are yet another way, inline with wearables and HomePods, to make the Apple ecosystem more stickier even for those, who do not have other Apple devices but iPhone. And a yet Another way to guide iPhone only people to other Apple devices. The stickiest ecosystem means the best product margins, it is good for Apple that they can profit from their ecosystem improvement, but otherwise the services income is irrelevant long term.",

"What are the health applications possible through the Apple watch. Is it possible to monitor pulse, and give ECG readings?

"Installed base drives services growth, as do additional services and upgrades.  Plus, it's persistent. Hell, I lease a car (same model last two times) that I will lease again on expiration and one reason is that I really don't want to shift manufacturers.   And I'm no stranger to tech.  I've designed, built, sold, and serviced a bunch..... consumer electronics right up to aerospace stuff.    I can handle tech.    I am not, not for one microsecond, going to throw away all the muscle memory of the last several years of Apple product use for a savings of a few pennies on an Android.  I'm not going to jump face first into an ecosystem that relies on Microsoft (again) and Google (""Let's update Android never!"").   Almost every adult I know is in the same mindset.    This services stuff is sticky.   And once activated, it's a reliable rainstorm of income at high margins.  Yeah, handsets are important.  And in that measure, Apple still captures the lion's share of the entire segment of profit.... around 60-65%.     I'm not running away from that because some ""me too"" analyst heard a rumor about a rumor from a guy with a friend and is desperate for blog material and knows a negative story gets read.I've been in since 2001 or so.

"Services depend on the iPhone. Although services have been growing, it is from a very low base. This is easy growth. If iPhone sales decline, as all analysts expect, then service growth will slow and potentially stall or even decline. Why should Apple deserve a P/E of 15-20 if it has no growth? A P/E of 5-10 would be more appropriate.",
"Too many people, especially the so-called ""analysts"", have a habit of misreading Apple; trying to envision the company as a single-product device when that is exactly what it is NOT. This focus on iPhone numbers has always been their Achilles heel, which is why they've never understood why Apple's stock has kept rising despite the gradual slowing of growth.",
I just love the narrative of the Service growth over and over again.  It seems to me to be a straw man argument to give face that Apple has dropped 30% for loss of unit sales.  How many more Apple shareholders will buy new iPhones in 2019 to support their investment thesis?  What was good for Apple in the past 12 years does not equal to the future performance.  The future is highly competitive and Apple has already lost market share in China.  The momentum is building in India as well. How badly will it be?  Only time will tell.  Will it be another IBM?  It’s definitely interesting to hear the guidance for Q2 considering all these promotions in Q1 pulling demand forward...,

The Aphria agreement includes preferred pricing and a formula to reduce the price as the market drops. Aphria will also be planting Emblem's proprietary strains as well as providing bulk oils to be process into Emblem's proprietary derivative products. The agreement is for 5 years and is renewable by Emblem for multiple 5 year periods. While supply seems to be in short supply now, this will not be the case in another year or two. Instead of sitting on expensive facilities, Emblem is putting their money into innovative products like their oral sprays, soon to be released oil-filled capsules and an extended release tablet that is in the process of receiving Health Canada approval. Emblem is currently garnering an industry-leading $10+ per gram for cannabis sales and their derivative products continue to make up a larger percentage at $15 - $20 per gram equivalent. Once again, I get it that most people are programmed to value funded capacity, but in another year Emblem is going to be sitting pretty. At 2X 2019 sales, it is ridiculously undervalued and the top play in the sector.",

I like NFLX but tech stocks as a whole are pricey and their earnings growth rate is decelerating so NLFX will be punished due to tech ETF selling. Thus I am avoiding NFLX and all tech stocks.,
"DIS content is narrow, NFLX content is broad.  It is too much of a generalisation to say that one source of content finds greater favour within or outside the US - it depends on the individual.  As a reminder, it is in the US that DIS content will be withdrawn, though it is fair to assume the rest of the World will follow.

I would say half of that number is certain to pay for their upcoming streaming service.On top of that, Disney content is more accepted, watched, and sought after around the world, whereas Netflix content is mostly for Americans. You argue Netflix is great at creating original content. Well, Disney owns some of the greatest content and IP creations of all time, and has been doing it for close to a century.

At these valuations I don't see how I will ever get my money back as an investor if I purchase the stock now as a long term investment.

AMZN sandbagged their forward guidance. They will crush all metrics at their next EPS report...,
I have no idea what Amazon stock is worth so I took my profit. Traditionally the stock price was based on rapid growth. Is the shift to a traditional valuation going to hammer the stock price? Who knows? AWS is a great business but does it support the stock price? The next 12 months will see a shake out whereby Amazon's businesses can be better valued. I suspect we will get a better picture of the retail business going forward and how profitable AWS really is. I would like to know how Amazon's cloud margins compare with Microsoft's. Market share is less important. A bit anecdotal but I have noted quite a shift to on-line purchases from traditional retailers. They make it very easy to return items to stores. They make it easy to return items by mail. They advertise specific products and bargains direct to consumers. The upshot is I will wait a few quarters to evaluate Amazon. It may or may not be a buy.,
"Amazon will undoubtedly continue to evolve in ways that benefit the company through higher margins, but how the market responds to the shifts in their retail model is difficult to predict. As a consumer, I've never been a big Amazon shopper as I prefer to be able to interact with humans if I have purchase issues, and it's also important to keep money in the local economy. But I do increasingly make purchases online, and I question the third-party model being emphasized by both Amazon and Walmart. Why would I shop online for electronics from either of these vendors when they funnel me to sellers I've never heard of? I find it ridiculous to have to investigate every vendor for reputability when I can get the same (or better) prices from Best Buy while enjoying in-person customer service, tech support, and a range of options for how I pick up my product. Same goes for clothing and other items.

While ENB is not a bad company (unless you are a EEP shareholder who has to take their lowball buyout offer) I would say there are better growth opportunities.

"One factor is completely misunderstood in Netflix valuation is its pricing power. The cable subscription is going down by a million a year and even those who have not cut the cord are subscribing to a bare minimum of cable content to get a better deal on broadband. Eventually what will remain will be a bunch of OTT services that will include Netflix, Amazon, Disney, Turner/HBO, NBC and the motley bunch of others represented by a consolidator. Other than AWS, Netflix & HBO, regular networks will unlikely be abandoning their ad-supported model hence I expect that at some point their OTT service will be ad-supported, and they will have lower price point (case in point CBS OTT which charges $5+ads/month). Consumers today typically pays around $80 for the pay-TV subscription. We might end up in a situation where Disney, CBS, NBC, Turner ad-supported OTT to take up approx $40 fro our pocket. That will leave another $40 among HBO, Netflix, and AWS. The volume of Netflix content is likely to make it a winner in that category. We can hence expect a moderately exponential increase in Netflix subscription charges every year. That will take care of its profitability.",

"Netflix has a fundamental business model problem. Trading at a multiple of 100 and it has very limited pricing power. It can’t raise prices a whole lot. On the other hand, the expenses on content creation will continue to rise. This is already causing significant cash burn problems and revenue can only rise so much. Competition may not be significant at this point but in a few years it’s going to have that problem as well, especially if a larger players like Apple and Disney decide to ramp up streaming services revenue. The best case scenario is for Netflix to become one of the many. Nobody cares that Motorola invented the cell phone and even Motorola had significant revenues coming in with its patents.

"This is a pretty decent analysis. I'd point out that 3 years of subscriber growth going forward relies more and more on international and less and less on the almost saturated US market. Original content will have to be produced around the world, in each local language. This may delay the onset of that increase in margins, it could take a bit longer to settle at 15%. Almost everyone who is bullish at current prices believes all the assumptions you have above PLUS significant price increases over the 3-5 year time horizon, reasoning that as original content goes up, ability to charge more like cable companies goes up. There are problems with this reasoning (competition, variety of channels on cable) but its long and complicated. While revenue and content make it seemingly a much simpler company to model (than say a biotech pharma with 10 drugs in the pipeline and 3 current blockbusters), the soft analysis behind the future pricing, margins and cost growth is challenging. This alone warrants a significant margin of safety. More money has been lost assuming everything goes right than assuming shit happens and pricing for it.",

"Redfin = Unlimited upside.  Redfin's target audience are customers. Zillow & Compass & Realogy target audience are real estate agents. Big difference.  Opendoor with the recent acquisition of homelistings is targeted for both consumers and now agents.  This makes Redfin unique and creates a lot of upside.Barriers to entry are enormously high to compete with Redfin.  That is why no one has tried to copy the business model, over the last 10 years.  Redfin has a huge head start!  No one has a website and employed agents, but Redfin.  They employ all of there own real estate agents!  They started from a single agent in Seattle.  Organically grown without just buying brokerages (ie.Compass) or selling ads (i.e. Zillow).If you understand the concept of the business, you can extrapolate the upside potential.  From there you did to determine if you think management is capable of producing the potential results.  Imagine what GK and crew overcome starting a brokerage from scratch?  Watching there neighbor in Seattle, Zillow grow. Knowing if they stayed patient & execute their plan it will pay off 100 x bigger in the end.They are in about the 3rd inning of there plan.  They are on pace for ~1B annual revenue in 2020/2021.  When they reach 1B in annual sales, they should be worth ~3B market cap/enterprise value.  Once they reach 1B in sales AND the brokerage is still growing at +20% y/y AND secondary revenue (Mortgage/Redfin Now/Redfin Title) begins to meaningful contribute to the balance sheet - It will be a very fast trip from 1B to +5B in sales.  That is the potential upside.The two questions are:  Do you believe Redfin management will/can do it?  Are you patient enough to wait?Due to many, many reasons - I think management will & I am willing to wait.Long Redfin.",
"Be careful with this article, readers. This author has barely a superficial understanding of the business models of Zillow and other companies discussed such as Redfin. Zillow is an advertising platform - ads are how they make their money. Redfin is a brokerage, which is a very very different business and in no way comparable to Zillow. Yes, the two companies are related to real estate but that does not mean they are similar businesses. Would anyone compare Home Depot to Amazon because they are both in retail and sell goods? I don't think so.Zillow's margins should be higher than Redfin by the nature of the business - ads do not require human capital like a brokerage does. Ads have juicy high margins but create a business model with very low/no barriers to entry. Anyone can sell ads to make money. Redfin is the better long term play - Redfin has built a custom network of agents through their online platform to actually manage real estate transactions. Redfin's business is the type of business with high barriers because it takes years to penetrate local markets.Long Redfin.",
"This is possibly the worst article I have ever read on Seeking Alpha and difficult to determine if written with an agenda, or just badly informed and lacking any knowledge of Zillow as a business. Lets put into context that Zillow is a badly run loss making company with accumulated deficits of $574M on its balance sheet and it seems management is incapable of understanding how to make its business model profitable. The biggest single reason for the losses is the $130M Share Based Compensation awarded each year to a handful  of executives who sell these discounted shares as soon as they can demonstrating zero faith in Zillows future.You mention the Jay Hoag recent share purchases without mentioning that Zillow founder and chairman Richard Barton made similar share purchases a few days before Hoag. It raises questions whether Barton and Hoag acted in collusion to artificially support the slump in Zillow share price after disappointing 3rd Quarter earnings and pessimistic  outlook. Maybe the SEC needs to investigate these share purchases.You also mention how stable the balance sheet is with Assets of $4,202m and Liabilities of $883m, whilst failing to mention that assets include $1,931m of Goodwill and $291m of other Intangible Assets. That's after a $174m Impairment Charge taken in 2017 4th Quarter in respect of Trulia Goodwill writedown, proving that Zillow substantially overpaid for Trulia, and no doubt further Impairment Charges to come based on disappointing Trulia performance according to CEO Spencer Rascoff's comments on the Q3 Earnings Call.",

"One has to be careful when comparing JD with Amazon. Whilst Amazon has spent tens of billions in tech areas  like AWS, Kindle, video services, Alexa, etc JD has spent  almost nothing in these high value add businesses. Another point worthy of mention is that Amazon has used internally generated funds to invest, however, JD has issued more paper and sold key assets to fund its investments and in mostly, land purchases, warehouse construction and equipment (JD categorises it as R&D expenses). Alibaba makes close to $10b a year whilst JD has bled for 14 straight years so comparing their market caps can only lead to wrong conclusions as so many analysts have done in the past year. Anchoring a stock analysis on a   different stock even they are in the similar industry is rarely a profitable endeavour, the so-called anchoring effect.

They absolutely should have a low price to sales ratioBABA on the other hand makes money based on commissions, thus their margins are very high (60-70%) and thus that is why they have a “higher” price to sales ratio JD is undervalued for sure, but I disagree that using price to sales is the way to go here, especially when comparing to BABA whose revenues have a total different business model/margin profileThat said, nice article as usual!Best,Julian",

I would like to add to JD but find myself hesitating.Beyond the legal problems (and Liu 80% vote control), I am concerned that JD will be ""stuck"" in low margin businesses (retail, logistics) and kept out of higher margin areas (cloud computing, JD Pay, etc.) due to TCEHY presence in those spaces.No doubt, China (SE Asia) is a huge potential market and becoming the WMT of China (if not AMZN) is possible.  Will be nice when the legal and ""trade war"" issues are behind us and we can focus on fundamentals.",
China has 1 billion people .. that’s three times the size of the US. Give the company a chance .. if you are short term then yeah the company will struggle in earnings but long term it’s a winner,
"It's all about China. Look at all the big players-- BABA, BIDU, TCEHY, etc., they've all traded pretty much in lock-step, very high correlation, not surprisingly. JD has taken a bigger hit recently because of Liu not keeping it in his pants. Longs can only hope that this ends up being a non-event. The potential is, however, massive. While JD is no AMZN, AMZN did trade at 0.7x-0.9x sales at it's low points in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2009. All I did was look at the high-low stock price for the calendar year and measured that against calendar year sales (and used fully diluted shares outstanding for the year). JD is currently trading at 0.47x 2018 sales. Is that a big enough discount? Even if JD grows revenues at 15% in 2019 (estimates are for a 20% gain to $79 billion)-- that would mean revenues of $76 billion. Even at a 0.5x price to sales, that would put JD at over $25. That is probably the low in 2019. The high? It is entirely possible that JD could get to 1x sales again, as it has in every calendar year that JD has been public. 1.0x sales (against current estimates of $79 billion and using 1.5 billion shares out) would put JD above $52. Obviously that is an optimistic estimate. In my calculations-- other than a continued slowdown in the Chinese economy or an arrest of Liu-- JD is a very compelling investment at these levels.

However your comment about the IPO price seems to hint that the IPO price was “correct”. Maybe in 2014 people thought JD would be growing at 100% YoY and now this new P/S represents the same analysis but with different expectations, etc. just speculating, but I don’t think comparing past stock prices matters much unless we know what the market expected at the time we’re comparing to vs the new information we have now.",

"It's amazing how sponsored content writers resort to name calling and insults as their only recourse when challenged.  They literally make things up as they go to hold on to their fiction but it's doing no good - the prices are falling, falling and falling day after day after day because their sponsors are just getting out of this garbage.  This process, which is real, has been expertly ""factionalized"" and portrayed in the Godfather film by way of Hyman Roth trying to unload his Havana holdings ahead of the big shoe drop down there.It's been said that a hundred lies a day emanate from the Trump administration.  Who knows about that?  It could be more or it could be less - for sure it's a lot.  One thing about market liars though, is that we can pinpoint them with more accuracy as the prices of the subject securities and markets drop day after day and the charts reveal that the shares are being distributed by the composite operators.The only questions remaining to be asked is if and when will these sponsored writers and pundits step up and apologize to all of their readers and subscribers for their faulty promotions.  If they were not sponsored, they should be telling people not to touch gaming with a 10 foot pole and to stay 10 miles away from anything Asian right now unless and until there is more visibility as to a number of macro issues that are now clearly pointed in the wrong direction. I'm not saying this is anything more than a normal cycle but a cycle it is and macro  financial conditions do not favor prospects for gaming and certainly not gaming in Asia.As far as the canard about the billions some companies are investing - that's OPM, my friends, OPM - look it up - OPM spends a whole lot easier and freer than their own money.  Sure...and OPM spends high, wide and happy because the spenders take their rake off the top of that too.  These managers are riding high wide and happy on your money if you've made the mistake of sticking with them after exactly July 3, 2018 (or LVS < $70), which is the date by which every indicator in the book was flashing sell and the A/D and OBV lines crossed to reveal incipient distribution.

"Howard,Guess you are tired of the trolls.  Presuming that it will take 10 years by 2028 at 4% increases per annum to reach $60 Billion GGR. I guess that the EBITDA from these countries as Mass GGR increases as a total of casino Revenues. This would also reinforce that an increase of Hotel Stays in Macau and Henquinn Island would occur.Thus margins will strengthen in Macau. Will there be an increase costs for the renewal of the license to the Casino Operators by the Macau government, yes, just like what happened in Malaysia. In most cases the established casino operators will renew. The Americans will not be challenged, because China wants to feel that foreign investment is a benefit, especially when China is the foreign investor. Chinese company just spent $5.2 Billion for Wilson Racquets. Though in the last 18 months foreign investment has dropped there is still $95 Billion in Chinese Foreign investment occurred since 2015, a sword cuts both ways.",

"@7716391 Marathon's bag hold is close to a half billion dollars so that must be some favor.Unless a Marathon board member has recently awakened to find the remains of what was his previously prized thoroughbred in his bed, I would suggest that your explanation of Marathons's investment to be quite a stretch.Besides, this is only one institutional investor.I suppose Black Rock, Charles Schwab, Bank of NY Mellon, Met Life, Northern Trust and many others who have increased their holdings recently could all be either part of this conspiracy or mopes, but I tend to doubt it.The recent arrest of the Huawei executive, continued strained relations with China & a US economy that could go south would certainly have a negative impact on LVS. The share price at a 52 week low & a nice dividend is going to garner a fair amount of bargain hunting investor attention & please correct me if I am mistaken but the SEC filing indicates a direct purchase of shares by the COO on 7/31.Place your bets as you see fit.",
"@7716391 So who exactly is the in the know set ?Institutional ownership grew in the last quarter which indicates to me that others see some value in the current share price.Marathon Asset Management made LVS their largest portfolio holding going from zero to over 5%.

"Is there really any question any longer as to the credibility of promotional content like this?  How can there be any doubt remaining that institutional and other interests use writers in channels such as this one to support market prices as they exit the name(s)You may ask, ""..well, the price of LVS has declined so much already, what would be the point...""  Well, remember, we are talking about billions of dollars in share holdings that have to be unloaded - much of which is associated with a cost basis that is a fraction of current market price, or zero in the case of management.  One doesn't do that overnight - it takes months or even years in some cases.  If they tried to unload without a long term plan in place, the price would really crater and they'd have NOTHING.  One explanation, and the most plausible, is that they are promoting the stock(s) at these levels to get out at this level because they know there a many more shoes to drop.What are we looking at as far as LVS?  We are looking at a company run by a management team that has close associations with the current Trump administration, which is now two years into what many, if not most, have deemed to be the most corrupt Federal administration in the history of this country.  Some of you may say ""..so what, that just means LVS shareholders will reap all kinds of corrupt benefits and advantages from the relationship with the current administration....""  To that I say ""....not so fast, punk, ...do you feel lucky punk.... do you feel lucky when the in the know set is obviously out here actively promoting a distribution campaign?""  This whole promotional distribution campaign could very well be confirmation that the entire corrupt hall of shame is coming apart at the seams.This China situation portends potential collapse in the Macao handle and the US economy looks like its in or entering a slowdown that will portend poorly for domestic gaming - aka another down cycle of who knows how much magnitude.  That's before even considering how much on-line gaming continues to take share from physical casino space.In a nutshell - don't be taken in by this chicanery - wait for the numbers to come to you.  The promotional activity on the stock tells me there is a huge shoe about to drop - wait for that and the fallout before stepping into this cesspool.  Then, by all means, take a dive when you can get these assets cheap.  A serious but conceivable cut in revenues could easily translate into an EBITDA cut of 50% - which means you are paying today something in the mid-twenties as an earnings multiple for this outfit - which ain't cheap.",

"Hold your horses!""..Having worked as a senior executive in the Trump casino business......""What is this disclosure supposed to be messaging?  Is this intended as a warning to ignore the content or a badge of honor intended to lend credibility?  ..It seems to me this should be a warning to ignore or at least question the content since I think it's been established that the Trump  enterprise was one of the biggest debacles in the history of gaming.  Whether Trump himself actually lost money on the deals is a matter open for argument but I think it's pretty clear and established that almost everyone else lost money, from the State of New Jersey, to the lenders, to the illegal immigrants who cleaned the rooms.How you can lose money in a rug joint is a mystery, but the Trump organization somehow managed to pull that off - whether it was intentional or not is still an open question.  I'm guessing the whole deal back there and then was more of a set-up for Russians to launder post cold war cash than it was a bona-fide gaming operation.Which gets back to Macao.  It seems to me that while there is certainly a legit component to gaming over there - in that Asians are notoriously consummate and addicted gamblers - you stil have to face the fact that a big part of the business is still money laundering.  If and how China sets up capital flow control to stabilize (or desabilize) its curency, so goes the gaming business over there.  At the end of the day, without the money laundering component, the handle would be down probably 30% and the rake would be down at least 50% - and them's the numbers you really need to know about the gaming business.",

The day the S&P 500 fell to a low of 666.  No one rang a bell on March 9, 2009 and said: ""This is a major bottom, folks.  Time to back up the truck and buy, buy, buy.""In fact, on March 9, 2009, most of the folks on the financial news shows had that glum look of fear that some people have when they are facing an audit by the IRS.One clue that we are at or near a bottom is the expressions of fear and gloom on the faces of those on the financial news shows.  The more fearful and gloomy they look, the more chance that we are at or near a bottom and that it  is a great time to buy stocks.

"@Andreas Hopf Yes, Content is king, but customers need to access content some how. Companies that can provide higher speeds at lower costs will dominate the hardware landscape.All are investing heavily even Huawei.I think however that Huawei commercial practices are illegal and harm innovation in the long run which government should control. The shutdown of NOK and ERIC which has people working all over the world will benefit only Huawei..... China......Lately governments under the excuse of National Security are banning Huawei. I think National security is not the only problem which IMO is the least one, more important is to keep competition between this companies and this must be done with same rules for all.I know Huawei lately gives away high speed routers equipment to certain companies while there are a lot of companies like Cisco, Juniper, Arista losing customer. Government should forbid this practices.This strategy was used by Huawei in the Microwave segment and ended with companies like Canadian DragonWave which has excellent technology but couldn't withstand the Chinese cycle. Others like Intracom and AVIAT are surviving.At the end, the low prices Huawei impose in certain areas of telecom cause damage and is not going to benefit anyone !I'll also mention net neutrality as a factor of harming the companies and innovation. Telecom Companies must invest more and more to keep with the endless demand for more speed. I compare this with a Highway. If you want to move bigger and heavier trucks on a Highway you pay for more axles and weight. I think services which are bandwidth hogs should pay directly or indirectly to the telecom companies for usage / saturation of the bandwidth. In the future AR and VR will be even more bandwidth hangry than today video services like Netflix, Youtube etc. If Government and telecom industry doesn't  sit and give some regulatory scheme to this the complete telecom industry will bankrupt and with it all related supply chain.ATT total debt 349 BBsVZ 209 BBsTMUS 45 BBsS 59 BBsTelefonica 88 BBsAMX 59 BBsAll companies has negative assets.....And with 5G investment cycle around the corner this is just getting worst....Content companies should share the investment somehow !",
"Telecom equipment provider market is a crappy market to be in - even when there are not that many players left compared to 10 years ago (compared to many other markets you could be in).The reason is that the TEPs have to operate between Telecom operators who have extremely good negotiating power and have pushed prices of telecom equipment to ridiculous levels compared to how much money they make with them. Then, on the other side is semiconductor and other supplier side companies to TEMs that also have better negotiating power than TEMs. Just look at the margins (both GM and OP) that are created on both sides of TEMs and you get what I mean.And then there is Huawei to eat Nokia and Ericsson from the side (except in US which alone won't save either one because eventually US companies also want piece of that pie).I wonder where the GROWTH will come from now that Nokia has nothing left than huge exposure to crappy TEM market. I do not count 5G as growth because that is just one more spending wave on top of long list of Gs and half-Gs.Seems every initiative so far from Nokia to get more legs have failed.I think that is the biggest failure of the board and the top management.Long NOK, but VERY unhappy about performance of the stock since the high after Alcatel-Lucent acquisition.Waiting for 5G or laying off people aren't going to cut it long term..",
"BinartechI largely agree with your take on NOK  except in the first part where you say 5g will not be a differentiation for NOK or presumably anyone else. Here I am 100% different from you if I understand you. Of all the 5g providers, companies are going to have to decide who is their best long-term 5g/network partner from a performance and cost basis. I am confident NOk has the greaest likelihood of emerging a winner in the battle for market share because of their superior hardware, software, and their  ability to implement user-friendly network managemernt tools.I think there will be 5g winners and losers in the battle for market share so thqt's where my money gets spent.",

"NOK is best positioned4.5 g/ 5g provider as things now stand imo. Even the Chinese are impressed (see other alpha posts, and review prior announcements). They have been successful in 5g implementaions on a smaller scale as proof of concept. They have made many excellent decisions that make them attractive to buyers such as their ability to  integrate 5g hardware/software that includes and uses current 4g hardware. Companies are not going to want to write off their current 4g assets. I do have reservations about their CEO. I  think he can execute a strategy but he sure can't sell it. In other words he comes off as lacking at least some flamboyant confidence and he seems wedded to point out ""risks"" all the time which makes investors cautious and hurts what multiples could be applied to their earnings and revenues. Stock is a strong buy, and price is supported by favorable tailwinds of more cost cutting (they seem to have executed well so far) and intellectual property/licensing revenues in addition to 5g conversions. The shift to 5g is going to happen earlier than late 2019 imo. The demand for 5g will be propelled by companies that need faster speeds and less latency right now to be competitive (e.g. music/video/ conent streaming companies).

"First time I’ve ever seen a stock go down 7% on an insider buy. CEO needs to get some funds involved already. Or, maybe they just aren’t interested.",
"Unfortunately, the COO sold AGAIN but it was part of a programmed sale for the purposes of taxes. The stock is basing here making higher lows and holding the 50 day. It doesn’t seem to want to stay below $5. I don’t know if you guys saw that 50k block trade a few days ago. Anyway, the chart is certainly much more constructive. Each passing week we are closer to FY2020. With estimates for next year at around 45 million its trading about 2x revenues or 1/2 the rev multiple the analysts have. Going into the best Q my sense is we see a slow creep higher going into that final Q as it really represents an inflection point: FNP ramp, the balance sheet in order with plenty of cash; the one hybrid campus on line and the other getting ready, and hopefully a full demonstration of leverage. Going from a loss of .13 cents to a loss of say .05 per share should produce a similar reaction which took place when, with the RN to BSN biz he turned the corner and went CF positive- essentially the stock doubled. Although back then the mkt cap was smaller, the stakes are now higher given the ARPU and TAM. I know it’s hard to sense now given the muted SP action, but these should be exciting times for the company and when IMHO you really want to start building a position. Moreover, it’s rather remarkably not that difficult to build a rather large position for now anyway.",
"I was wrong! Malcolm picks up another 7,000 shares! Nice to see",
Are they presenting at ROTH? I didn’t see that. Thanks!,
"Stock action is weak because management sucks at managing they Street. They haven't beaten a quarter and they have not forced Street to raise in over a year. That's why no one is willing to buy. However, that is going to change in Q4 and in 2020. You're correct. It is a table pounder now and the herd will pile in once they report a beat and the Street has to raise. Until then, no one is going to do the work and buy the stock.I'm at 10.4-10.6m in Q4 and I think they lose 200K in adjusted Ebitda, but could possibly due better if they hit $10.6m. Roth conf should create interest in the stock if management tells the story well.With Aspen U revenue up 1m sequentially in Q4 and the mix continuing to shift to USU and pre-licensure and spending set to re-accelerate in 2020, they will beat Street estimates even if enrollments don't grow and they will grow, but no has figured it out so they will wait and bid it up after Q4.",
I actually have them losing .06 a share for the 4thQ,
"Conviction, what are your estimates for 4thQ topline? I have $11.2 million but maybe I made a mistake. If I’m right, that would be a nice beat. As for bottom line, I have them not quite EBITDA positive. Anyway, curious as to your thoughts.",
"Well pretty ugly day but truth is the run yesterday was unwarranted (obviously). No reason though to be discouraged, not yet. As someone who has followed this from inception, I think now is the time to buy. Why? First, everything is finally in place- the two campuses, FNP, and the balance sheet. Moreover, we are heading into the best Q of the year. Revisions have reset the bar. It would be nice to see a few insider buys but I wouldn’t expect much as insiders are pretty loaded especially if I’m right assuming Malcolm took part in the debt financing. If my math is right they should approach 11million next Q. If they can just make a penny a share, wow! Imagine sequentially going from -13 cents a share to a penny. But maybe that’s a stretch. The point is I think you want to buy on weakness here- maybe another day down get it under $5. Everything gonna be just fine",
"Last thing, I stand by my comment (yes one of many) that the CEO was of two minds about working within the capital constraints. This was made manifest as one of the analyst asked explicitly what can we expect with ASPU core growth going forward I.e., are you diverting marketing dollars toward higher ARPU or... the answer seems to be with $ in the bank we are back to growth on all fronts hence the 1 million increase in ASPU core projection. I personally think this fine as the marketing efficiency, while not as great as the two new vectors, it pays! Moreover, with this seasonally the best time, go for it and have a blow out top line number (maybe 11 million?)  and simultaneously show leverage. In an ideal world, he does breaks 11 million AND shows CF positive.",
"3 months ago, on the CC, when asked about 3rd Q numbers he intimated 8.8. Now I guess there were some analysts revisions subsequent but I took then to be the result of him sandbagging. They weren’t. So he came in 300,000 light. I also was expecting better bottom line numbers. Of course, take out the interest expense.... well let’s call it an in line number. As for 4thQ I guess we have to wait and see. I don’t know if the March FNP enrollment was a one off and honestly I’m not sure what to make of the 1 million incremental revenue in ASPU core as the 4th is their best q.",
"I guess that's what makes markets. I thought it was a great call and nothing about it was depressing.Craig Hallum was at 8.2m and Roth was at 8.3m and he did $8.5m and one guy at Lake Street was an outlier at $8.7m. He's half way through Q4 and there's no way he does only $9.9m if he's doing 165 FNP's already and Aspen U is growing by $1m plus sequentially  so I'm happy with the results and I am sorry you are not. Hopefully, you will be happy with the next quarter.",
"I know this is not their best Q, and the holidays played a part, but he missed on top and bottom and the tone of the call was just depressing.",
"Really? why? Doesn't take a lot of math to figure out that he's well ahead of sell side numbers with FNP growth and he said Aspen U growth is going to be up 15-20% in Q4 and that's ahead of Street expectations and he had a record Jan so he basically said that the sell side numbers for Q4 were conservative and he should be near adjusted ebitda break even in Q4. (Aspen U was also positive cash flow in Q3). That's what I heard. He grew revenue 49% Y/Y and the stock is 1.9x fwd numbers which are a quarter away and he said he's doubling the new campuses which have a $30K LTV and guided USU up around 50% next year, which is conservative if you look at the run rate. So, I liked teh call. Fully funded company now too and i expect them to be able to transition to lower cost bank debt by end of 2020 which will save them money too.",
Well I guess he wasn’t sandbagging... that was not a good call,

Nursing, for now, is not threatened by robotic technology, the demographics suggest an increased need and as ASPU continues to gain name recognition amongst not only nurses but the hospitals that employ them given the cost savings it’s difficukt not to see sustained and improved growth. What has been holding us back was a) balance sheet (now cured); b) leverage demonstration (I agree with Conviction this is coming next Q) and c) notwithstanding DeepValue’s suspicions a more constructive chart. The latter is now in play assuming we stay above the 50 day. Next Monday should be interesting. Given how late the call is, we should hear quite a bit about the 4th Q, the best Q of the year. It appears the CEO is methodically executing on all these fronts.",
To the extent that financing was holding us back (Conviction how about chiming in here) then we should have no place to go but up. I was hoping for a straight convert striker at $7 but whatever this should clear the road! Now we have numbers next week and more importantly 4th Q coming up and that’s where I think you see the surprise and CF positive. Look at what happened when he achieved that milestone just with RN- BSN biz. This should go to $7 sometime between now and summer imho.,
"This is from the 8k: The amount paid represents the remaining outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Note ($1,000,000) and the interest thereon which would have accrued as of December 1, 2019, the final maturity date of the Convertible Note ($80,000). He PRE-PAID the interest that would have accrued. You do NOT do that NEVER unless it’s made a pre-condition (terminate all debts) to future financing. I think some big news is coming. Regardless, the chart says buy, the season says buy, it’s got an all green light. Let’s see.",
I believe he paid the interest due in December! That’s the point.,
"Why would he pay off a debt not due until Dec WITH accrued interest? This has to be a condition to some other financing. To the extent the street is looking or this, it’s really bullish,",
"I think what is more interesting is that the company reaches break even at a little over $10m in revenue, which makes FYQ4 (current quarter) a realistic possibility to break even. Street isn't expecting break even until Q2 or December. With USU now in ramp mode (after a delay) and pre-licensure also ramping, the mix shift to higher ARPU degree programs should start to boost revenue and show operating leverage in Q4. As these higher ARPU programs increase from 15% to 30-35% of mix in FY2020, Aspen should be well positioned to handily beat Street numbers which don't reflect the mix shift.",
"No. The small sells were done by a former board member, who was not asked to stand for re-election recently. Insiders own around 25% of the company and have been adding recently albeit small buys.",
"Anyone else find these insider sells, albeit small, disconcerting? The latest one probably put a halt to a nice run over $5. Of course, I realize insiders sell for all sorts of reasons but ....",
Just saw CECO and LOPE- wow! The sector on fire.,
"I think your numbers are on target. If they are. If it looks like this time next year, they are looking to exit FY2021 with ~ 65 million in revenue then I think this should double within 12 months (3x 2021 Revenue = 190 mil/18.5 mil shares= ~$10 a share). I do worry a little about all the Democratic talk about free post secondary education but I’m fairly certain that goes nowhere. The deficit has already exploded (I’ve been long gold miners for last 3 months as well). As I wrote before, this is probably a great opportunity as we are inbetween the reset. Once he begins to demonstrate what we all think he can he will move and probably quickly.",
"Couple thoughts on the business. Don't care about stock price and timing.1. If the company accelerates marketing spend, growth will accelerate.2. If conversion rates on existing marketing spend improve, growth will accelerate3. If both happen, growth can turbo charge 4. As current enrollment advisors ramp their productivity revenue growth will accelerate, they don't need to add head count.In sum, you can see acceleration in growth from here with operating leverage and this will start to play out in Q4 as enrollments ramp in seasonally stronger qtr. Not sure why Q1 has to be down from Q4 if they aren't spending heavily in Q1 quarter with lighter enrollments especially if their enrolled base is higher exiting FY2019. Time will tell.Furthermore, all you have to do is look at the existing enrollments at USU and in the pre-licensure business and run the math for the next 10 quarters. Without ramping FNP run rate any further or adding additional degrees to USU, you should see revenue ramp from $6-$7m at USU in FY19 to $12m in FY20 to $19-$20m in FY21. Just look at the enrollments the company discloses each quarter in their programs and run the math. You can build a model and get a pretty good ballpark assessment of the trajectory.(They have the lowest cost and most flexible FNP degree on the market. They should have no problem gaining share overtime, so one has to assume the current FNP run rate is going to accelerate overtime) Pre-licensure should ramp from $2m in FY19 to $6m in FY20 to $12-$13m in FY21 and be on a run rate of over 1000 students paying $48K for the degree and they pay cash upfront. Again, they have a 40% cost advantage and the market is growing so it is safe to say they will grow this program too overtime.USU could add additional degree programs overtime as well. Now that management has re-set the sell side, they control their own destiny after having to deal with sky high sell side expectations the last year. I just hope they continue to invest for growth and don't show too much operating leverage. They just need to get to break even (so people aren't worried about burn) and then continue to aggressively take market share. They have the best value proposition in the industry and students and hospitals seem happy with their offering.",
"As I believe I’ve added more to this discussion calling into question the author’s assumptions and stating that $4.50 looked like a resting place and a good entry point, I’ll continue to post. The issue with this company is a) there is 0 institutional interest, b) it’s currently a business in transition and nobody seems quite certain where this is going. Now that can represent a great opportunity or it’s a disaster. Hence, for most smart investors it’s a wait and see. The numbers this Q don’t look exceptional so much of the hope will rest with the 4thQ. I suspect, should there be a recovery it will happen sometime between April and end of May as investors look to get in before the 4thQ results. The problem is after those results you have the seasonally weak 1stQ. Almost like you can’t win. As I’ve stated moreover he might achieve CF positive or close to it in 4thQ but it will dip red again in the 1stQ FY2020. This said, I’m thinking it’s dead money for another 6 months as he begins to hopefully demonstrate leverage and really the business model (at this point it’s just investor subsidized education). I still think $4 might be in the cards and that’s where, all things being equal (assuming the numbers are not a disaster) that’s where you want to load it. I sold everything I bought over the last 3 days yesterday and today, keeping my core holding, and looking to add at $4",
"You do what you want. I think I raised some valid concerns. Again, this is NOT about a one day or one week or even one month move down but rather a lengthy nose dive. You are painfully aware of this whether you want to admit it or not. Typically, a stock doesn’t lose 50% in a ranging market without cause. Now what is that cause? That’s what I’m trying to ascertain. Is it a balance sheet issue as Roth intimates? Perhaps but that seems almost made up as they have no great need for cash. Yet, it’s obviously on your mind as well as other investors as why bring it up? Is it that investors have lost faith in a CEO who has gone back to the equity markets even when he said it wasn’t in the cards? Is it confusion: are you working within the financial constraints you have striving toward the goal of CF positive OR are you looking for more $ to keep the growth trajectory? Is it concern over the two new businesses? Perhaps margins are lower. The CEO himself stated that it was too early in the life cycle to be certain what those margins might be. Look, ASPU despite its inclusion in the Russell micro cap, doesn’t go directly with the stock market, but when it’s a risk off month one would think funds would be looking for a beaten down name such as this and my guess is after reviewing it they are passing. Is it the balance sheet? Maybe. If so, I guess we’ll have to see how and when he addresses it.",
"find someone else to vent with. I have no interest in llistening to you compalin. I made a 5 year investment and I don't care what teh market does day to day. The company is taking market share so if people want to sell because the sell side had high estimates and teh company is still growing at a high rate or whatever other reason they want to sell I don't care. That's what markets are for, but I have no desire to listen to your complaining.",
"Hmmmmm at least be honest. Yes, the stock had a good day Friday (the market was up 400 points) but this stock has gone straight down for 6 months. Hence, my frustration was not unwarranted. Let’s see if it continues.",
"Haha Situm,Did you forget to post becaus eteh stock was up on Friday? You only post when you're stressing because the stock isn't keeping up with the martket on a day to day basis? Don'tyou need to vent some more today or ar eyou taking the day off because the market is closed and the stock can't go down?  You're a joke.",
"As opposed to what Conviction said, the lesson here is not that youhave to buy when news flow is bad but you have to sell when it’s good! That ASPU Director sold a million shares at $7.40! That was the best trade in this thing.",
"Market up 4,000 points from the December low and we are testing a two year low. If you guys run money the bench Mark is making this look even worse.",
"While capitalization still remains a topic of investors, if resolved, it could translate into share appreciation for what is still a very disruptive, multi-faceted, high growth story.",
Read the Roth piece!,
"Wow! This is non stop! It’s almost comical. What a fucking short (too bad I’m long). Let’s see if $4.40 holds. If not, I guess it’s 4 bucks. Seems to me investors want to see the leverage and they’re not convinced it’s there. Guys, here is my question: what the fuck is the CEO doing? I thought, and so did DeepValue, that the balance sheet was not an issue, that the CEO had a plan toward breakeven and the revolver was insurance. Now, out of nowhere, it’s ohhhhh investors have questions about the balance sheet so we need to do a raise. Does this guy know what he’s doing? Jesus, commit to a fucking strategy! Either, work within the capital constraints you have or fucjking do a raise already. But this of two minds bullshit is leaving what investors are left confused. Clearly articulate wtf you’re doing! This is a shit show",
"Look I too added and I’m certainly not selling. That said, man this has to be the worse price I’ve EVER encountered. It will be very telling what happens post earnings and whether any insiders will be buying after the window opens. It also better not break the low of $4.40 or you’ll see an avalanche of selling. It should be noted that the whole sector is a shit show.",
"I would also add, unless you guys are tapped out, if you haven’t reconsidered, you might want to average down here at $4.60. Deep value you loved it at $6, go ahead and feast on it at $4.60. But we both know you too have doubts about this and have begun to question the wisdom pronounced in your article. In fact, my suspicion is your article was designed to help your underwater position. But that’s fair enough. We’ve all done that. But let’s stop with being disingenuous. There’s only you me and Conviction here and all 3 of us are fucked at this point.",
"I was asking Conviction who presumably has been in this stock going on two years! That imho is sufficient time to reasses. In the interim, there have been at least 3 revisions to forecasts, none of them positive and the stock over this two year period has gone nowhere. It seems to me that is sufficient to begin to question your investment thesis. Ergo, my question!",
"Lastly, it’s not volume isn’t there. Shorts have actually covered albeit only about 7%. Market is ripping so it’s not a bad market. Momo chasers have left long ago. This leaves two possibilities: either there are questions about the business model I.e., leverage (but the CEO can’t be that dumb- although I’m beginning to wonder) or investors don’t believe the CEO when he talks of debt financing and think a secondary is coming. It has an EV now of about 75 million. Basically it trades for 2.5 x next year ASPU core numbers. You’re getting the other two businesses for free. Idk.",
"I have many questions! First, you’re very intelligent and that’s rare on this site. That said, Im curious when do you reasses? I understand that simply  share price will not sway you. But #s have been revised here several times. In fact, unless I’m mistaken just a few months ago the CEO said that other than ASPU core all other segments would be up this Q. Yet, USU was down. Roth blames “pronounced seasonality”. I’m beginning to wonder whether the CEO knows what he’s doing. Again, revisions have been pretty commonplace here over the last year or so. This along with a decimated stock, when do you say: maybe I made a mistake. Or, do you just attribute this to growing pains common with venturing off into two new businesses? Second, it was you I believe who first talked of balance sheet issues. I really didn’t see them at first as like yourself I saw they had two years of runway. But Roth reiterated your point so let’s take it as true. What do you think the CEO does? At first I thought maybe a convert. Now I’m thinking he’s having trouble getting interest on favorable terms and he’s going to wait a bit and try to demonstrate leverage and maybe use the “monster 4thQ” to garner interest. Curious as to your thoughts. You know if he has a “monster Q” maybe he enrolls 2,000 in the 4thQ. 2,000 would be a 50% YOY increase. But hey you never know.",
What is your question?,
"And lastly, this is why imho it’s silly to talk about a stock like this being a compounder. You simply don’t know what the future holds. My goodness in less than a year numbers have been revised down 3 times and you think you know what they will be in 3 or 5 years? It’s not like growth is autopilot. The CEO can’t even get numbers right 6 months out let alone 2 years out. And that’s just execution risk! How about competition or regulatory changes? No no it’s not a compounder- it’s just a broken stock.",
"Nice volume today, but we are on the low of the day. Something seems off. Maybe he can’t get financing in terms he wants? I think the street was unimpressed with his preliminary 3Q numbers. Whatever it is, this is going to take some time to heal. The chart is broken and next the story will be broken. A few months is one thing but this is going on a year. Even conviction has to be concerned as he thought less than a year ago USU #s would be 400 (per another comment) and they came in at 257. That’s a 40% miss. Now much of this was known but something tells me he isn’t getting what he wants in terms of financing so either he’s going to have to bite the bullet and sell 3 million shares at $4.25 or even $4, or keep going with what he has until he can demonstrate there is indeed leverage in this model and he can grow the company at a reasonable rate while curbing expenses. If it’s the latter, then the stock will meander probably re-year the lows (we are basically right there) until he starts to execute on what he says. In any event, it’s safe to say: he really fucked up.",
"Here are my numbers:FY 2019 34.5 millionFY. 2020 50 millionFY 2021. 64 millionBy this time next year, investors will be looking at FY2021 numbers. Giving revenues a 3 multiple stock should be approaching 10",
And finally Roth follows suite and reduces price target to $9. That’s the last of them....,
"Regarding the release this morning, one thing that stands out- they expect 1,000 pre-licensure students by April2020?! How is that even possible? That would be pretty amazing.",
"Actually that can’t be, it should be .40% x total cost of the program as I’m assuming they’re paying lump sum",
"when you model your rev numbers, for those that don’t participate in the monthly payment plan, do they pay a lump sum? So for example, I’m doing a spread sheet, I have for now 60% of the FNP enrolled choosing MPP or 350 a month. The other 40% I assign the LTM or $17,820. But is that right?",
"It does trade heavy and I guess that is giving shorts ammo to press the short. I would expect the last estimate revision to come soon and at that time, I believe the risk to a numbers miss is likely removed. I just think the company needs to shore up the balance sheet before it can attract new buyers. Someone looking at this for the first time isn't going to step in with this balance sheet, but I think the company realizes that. Lee Cooperman is a smart guy and has a lot of equity in this and he has already extended the company $5m so he's not going to walk away from his capital. There is some smart, long term capital in this name, but its going to take the company getting to break even and getting access to more capital to convince new buyers to step in and the shorts to cover.",
"Anyway, I can see FY 2020 revenues at 55 million. I know you think this is crazy but I don’t know what stops him from doing 150 FNP monthly. He did one month why not almost every month. Moreover, I think he can do 40 every semester prekicensure. Add it all together and next year he does close to 55 million. Give it 3x next years rev and your at about 8-9, or a double from here. The next CC will give you an idea",
2x normal volume today. Strange thought we’d have short covering rally with 2 or 3 times volume. This is going to take some time to heal.  It’s been a nasty year or so.,
"at $7.15 you were paying 4x revenue. Not expensive for a growth stock. It's pretty simple. If they execute on the numbers, the stock will be worth more. If they don't, it will be worth less.Not unreasonable to think that exiting 2022 they do $100m in revenue and the company is worth $400m. If they grow slower, they won't hit $100m until FY2023.In the short term, most people just care about Q3 and financing so the company hasn't given longs a reason to buy yet. Time will tell.",
"Can we be friends? I’m sorry man, I can get a little crazy, but it’s the passion I have for this shit. Anyway, I listened closely to last CC and I agree now with you that there was sandbagging. How much? I guess we shall see. I thought financing might be coming per my other posts. I’m teally curious how and what kind of financing. A convert? I’m gonna through out this theory- last April with stock  I think around $5.50, Mike does a secibdaryvpriced at $7.15. How did he get such such a premium I wondered at the time. Lo and behold, he thereafter preannounces good earnings, his second such preannouncmenf in like two months. Is that his modus operandi? Does this  presage a very favorable raise followed by a nice beat on revised numbers? I wonder if this is the playbook. Have a nice weekend.",
"I agree the re-set is in. Its been a long time coming and a lot of pain for investors the last 12 months. Good news is the sell side numbers are set low for next 6 quarters and company should beat comfortably throughout next year given the installed base of students and the ramp in pre-licensure and FNP next yr. Several catalysts:1. additional financing should be fairly imminent to allow for continued growth investment in the future2. adjusted break even within next couple qtrs3. additional pre-licensure campus opening 4. continued FNP ramp Over 600K shares short, heavy selling is over and re-setting numbers is complete. At 1.9x upcoming FY revenue, stock is too cheap even for widely conservative 25% growth. If they actually start beating numbers, stock will re-set. Doesn't taking much buying from here to move the stock. Atleast a $1 in the stock of short covering alone.",
"The market never gives you what you want. I wanted a whoosh down but oh well, I think a buy anywhere under 5 is pretty damn good. I now believe the reset is in and any good news and zoom zoom. What that news will be? I suspect it’s coming in or by next Q release.",
"i copied off the earnings call transcript:                                                                                         ""In terms of an update on our HonorHealth campus plan to be located on the north side of the Phoenix Metro, we expect to be signing the final agreement with HonorHealth by year-end and construction plans call for a build-out timeframe of approximately six months. So we're currently targeting our first semester to begin in July next year. We're expecting our half of the cost of the construction in TI to be about $600,000 which we are planning to expand over the third and fourth fiscal quarters. We're planning for the HonorHealth campus to be a mirror of our current campus.""",
Maybe an issue with the new campus? Wasn’t that supposed to be announced by now?,
Hmmmm nice close!!! Hahahahaha almost there guys. Again look for a big volume throw up day. Might break $4. Until then no reason to touch this. It’s officially the hedge fund roach motel.,
Need to just see a capitulation already! This shit is Chinese water torture. Collapse to 3.75 already!,
Wasn’t a downgrade per se just another analyst revising price target lower to &9. Craig Hallium. The only one left is Roth...I’m sure that’s coming as well.,
Who downgraded? Didn’t see it,
"Another downgrade today, price target revised down. One would think this rather late to the party. Stock making a new 52 Week low and still no interested buyers. I’m thinking 4 bucks",
Lot of shares available at $4.95. Thought it would be more difficult for these guys to cover.,
"That should be that. 13 months down trend hopefully is over. Now 600,000 shares have to cover, we can look forward to reaching adjusted EBITDA positive, and something tells them this could be a good year to own ASPU. Sorry if I frayed some nerves. The stock hit 4.66 (the bottom of the trend line) I don’t know why but feel pretty positive here. Take care",
And it goes lower.... well bought a little more at 4.78. Wow! Endless selling. A capitulation move is coming. That should take it to $4.50 and hopefully that’s it.,
I do think you guys know shit about trading but it’s clear there is some manipulation going on. Buys are made then a small amount of sells. They know there are some weak hands who can’t stomach the daily swings in P&L. But there is certainly less fear at the $4.85 mark. I think it’s basing for a move higher. Anyway I’ve been between 4.82 and 4.89,
Kinderhook blew out of 1/2 at 7? Pretty good trade...,
Stock putting in a bottom. Clear as day... I’ll give another day or two start buying last of my fill,
"Take care of yourself. You live in a bubble. Learn to see the other side of the trade and it will save you a lot of money. I’ll sell when I think it’s the best opportunity. BTW an insider sold 10,000. You don’t mention that but you hype a 500 share purchase. That’s your problem in a nut shell. Good luck but try and be more open. You’ll be a better investor.",
"I'm done talking to you, pal. You add no value and i have no more time for this thread. Please sell.",
"Yes Mike made this pitch in the last CC trying to justify why st prices higher this was a good investment. It didn’t work because it was over reaching. That’s what I was saying when I thought the whole in-house CRM system speech was over the top. Don’t get me wrong it’s added value as anything that keeps the kids in school helps but it doesn’t fundamentally change the company. I was wondering by the way, the extend that selling the company is an exit strategy who would buy it given how disruptive it is to the traditional accounting? Why would LOPE buy this unless they wanted to kill it? In other words, is the “moat” also an impediment to a sale?",
"Then you sure look foolish for buying it at higher prices and why would you still own it? If you think the business is worth 2-3x revenue then you will never make money owning the stock. You have to believe 25%-30% growth is the floor and the business has 20-25% ebitda margins at scale and is worth a minimum of 3.5x revenue. Otherwise, you will forever be a disappointed shareholder and one who gets lousy returns. I bought this because crappy education companies with low single digit growth trade at lower multiples than Aspen. Ed tech or not, the market pays a premium for growth. The reason Aspen isn't being rewarded now is because people are worried about the balance sheet.If they correct that, the stock will trade at a high multiple again. Ed tech or not just like it did 9 months ago.",
"Take it easy man... I am LONG! I’m not a disguised short. Moreover, nobody reads these comments let alone the article. So what I or you say is irrelevant. All I’m saying is that when trying to find “value” absent traditional discounted cash flow, the idea that ASPU is EdTech and deserves that multiple is misplaced. I also found it disingenuous by both the author and Mike to suggest that it deserves to be in that category. The market appears to share that sentiment. Instead, Lakestreet was correct drawing analogies with the co acquired by LOPE- they gave them 6x revs on the BUYOUT. Given that, ASPU certainly doesn’t deserve to TRADE at anywhere near that especially with revised down numbers. Lastly, I think I’ve contributed quite a bit as I said the downtrend is firmly in place and $4.50 looks like an imminent resting spot. Since then the stock is about 6%. Annualize that :)! Now I’m off to the gym. Have a nice night",
"You're hysterical. You're not long the stock because you BASH you're own investment and those who are also long. Get off the board. You add no value.By the way, Dollar General, Walmart and Tucows aren't sexy either, but they have made investors a fortune overtime because they provide the lowest cost services in an industry that is necessary.",
"Last thing, it’s like why buy a money center bank when you can buy Visa? If you look at ASPU as a for profit online company it’s not particularly sexy. The author of this article knew this too that’s why he threw in that gratuitous part about the in-house CRM platform developed by Mike. And again, no offense to the author, I thought about this when I heard Mike go off about this in the 2ndQ call. I asked myself whether he was trying to put lip stick on a pig for lack of a better expression. That’s a bit harsh but what I’m saying this is when you really think about it not the sexiest growth story out there. He was trying to move the investment thesis away from a sector long shunned by investors. But it’s not EdTech.",
"agreed. Everyone is waiting for the same thing which means, it will gap up very sharply when they have good news. Just short covering is over 600K shares now in a stock that trades 35-40K shares a day. Nothing like trying to squeeze out the last of your toothpaste tube.",
"I totally agree. That said, it needs to stabilize for me to get that last 1/3. I can’t seem to post the chart I have, but the downtrend takes it to $4.50 which would be cheap but markets reach to both extremes. If it doesn’t get there good! But I don’t see any hurry to get involved. You feel the overhang- it’s still heavy. But when it turns, you’re right, you’ll have to pay up.",
"The company has 2 years worth of balance sheet capacity so I am not sure why the stock acts so poorly. They could raise equity at anytime. Raising equity is a last resort. If they really needed the capital, they would go raise it. They recently raised $5m of debt that they haven't drawn upon, so it's not like they are in desperate need of capital. I think the market is overreacting. Otherwise, why wouldn't the company raise capital now? If the business was in a tough spot and they needed capital they would have already had to go the market for more money. Most interestingly, once the news flow gets better for Aspen, where are investors going to find the shares to buy? You can't buy illiquid microcaps when the news flow is good. Just need to stay patient.",
"No no I never invest in margin. I told you I’m 3/4 as long as I want to be waiting for capitulation to get the last 50,000 shares or so. I’m just watching it Trade as I watch all my other holdings. Not to toot my horn but up 17% since beginning of the year ex ASPU. Volume coming in here. Wonder if it’s short covering....",
"Situm,Why are you so worried about the stock price? Do you have a margin call? Why do think the company has chosen not to raise equity?",
"Thank you all for some great comments here. I haven’t seen anything that has changed the value proposition ASPU offers its customers, or that changes my belief they can execute. And, I’ve been adding at this level. Cheers!",
"I think you will be disappointed. I am not modeling $11m until Q2 of next year, but you have to realize I am expecting $34m this year and $44m next year, which I am fine with. I am more focused on getting to break even and then ending next year with 10% adjusted ebitda margins. I value break even over fast growth and if they choose to grow slower which is what they are indicating then break even is going to come soon and we sacrifice some revenue.Good trade off when we don't have a cash hoard.Cheers. I am done for this week. Time to go kite surfing!",
I’m going to share my numbers with you later! I broker then down :ASPU coreDoctorateFNPBSNI’ll send it later and perhaps I’m an idiot but I don’t see anything less than 11 million. Nice to hear about that purchase!,
"what are your expectations for Q4? I'm no where near 11m let alone $12m. I think $9.8-$10m is realistic. I am more focused on the bottom line. I am hoping they can get to adjusted ebitda break even but I don't think they will..stretch goal.However, I am confident they can do $43-$44m in revenue next year without stretching. The majority of that revenue comes from existing students so its not like they have to start from scratch plus ARPU is much much higher on USU and pre-licensure students so the mix shift is going to help a lot.Last call CEO said they could do $12-$13m in USU revenue bulk of which is FNP. Makes sense given current enrollments and continued ramp.Then he said $4m is achievable at pre-licensure Then without much growth at all you have $27m from the Aspen U.So that's $44m.  So, if he's going to sand bag at $40-$42m, $44m still seems very likely to me and this is on lower spend. Demand is there and biz will be at break even soon so I don't sense a panic.Malcolm Maclean, board member bought more shares today too. He has consistently been buying.Have a good weekend.",
A 500 share purchase from the CFO seems more like posturing to me. I originally bought in with Mr. Cooperman but I’ve always wondered whether his interest was more philanthropic than financial. I’m going to see how the 4th Q goes.,
"As a side note, two board members and the CFO have bought stock since the company reported in Mid December. CFO bought in last few days so I don't think that is a bad sign either.One of board members Malcolm Maclean owns over 600K shares and keeps buying. Leon Cooperman owns over a $1m shares and gave the company its recent 5m loan so I view that positively. Uncertainty creates opportunity for the patient and informed.",
"You should sell or get some valium. Numbers aren't going to be going up. They are slowing as they cut spend and get to break even. Shareholders have been complaining that they were spending too much money so they are cutting spend. If you cut spend you grow slower. You can't have it both ways. So, when you say they are in a desperate spot, it sounds like you are desperate?The market wants them to get to break even. The reason the stock dropped was because they were losing money. When they get to break even the stock price will improve. Ultimately, stocks need to become profitable. Not all about revenue. So, if you're worried about the stock definitely sell. There are people who love your shares. The stock market is volatile, but the business is in a great market with a huge cost advantage so I don't see that changing.Don't confuse stock price with business fundamentals.",
"Here’s my history: i know some people relatively close to the co. It was brought to me backnin 2014 when it traded on the pink sheets. I think I first bought it at like .10 cents prior to the rs. I did great and sold it all at around 5.50. I missed the ride up to 9 then re-entered around 6 as it came down. I started really loading it in December as I thought it was tax loss selling and the disaster that was December. So I’m about 3/4th as long as I can be which is long/ let’s leave it at that. That said, January has not provided the turnaround I thought we would see. Other positions have bounced hard but this has not. So it concerns me. I don’t think that’s irrational. So now I look for “conviction”......",
"Situm,I'm confused. I thought you are a shareholder at higher prices? I could care less what Aspen reports on a quarterly basis. The Street has been completely wrong on the numbers and yet the company has grown from $14m, $21m, $34mE and $43mE. The company will be worth a lot more in several years so if someone can't stomach the stock going to $4 before it goes to $7 then they should sell.Value is different than market volatility. I'll be a buyer if it goes lower. I love it when retail shareholders don't know what they own. I don't care if the stock is $4-$5 in a year. Value is created overtime.",
"I think the issue is pretty simple and maybe we are saying the same thing: the pivot away from RN to BSN was not done simply to engage in higher ARPU TAM but because CEO saw that growth would be slowing once 30 mil revenues was hit. Now he entered two other markets, each with better margins and in the case of pre-licensure higher TAM. But he just started! So now it’s almost like he’s back at Square 1 and it’s a wait and see approach - will he be able to build our new campuses at the rate he wants? Will be able to fill them as quickly as he says? Will FNP grow as he expects? Look he has reduced numbers like 3 times. The last one was hecsaud a “self imposed limit” as they await accreditation review. Although that makes sense is it just an excuse? Without a doubt he has lost the faith of many and if I were one of those funds who picked up a million shares at $7.10 based on numbers henceforth revised twice I’d be pretty cautious. In summary, this is could be an amazing buy opportunity. I still think it goes lower as the only hope is he beats on this Q or guides higher for the 4tg but we have 2 months of uncertainty and the market hates that. Lastly, this is an horrific market. Another downturn and they’ll be indiscriminate selling in even much more stable names, forget ASPU.",
"I don't think what people realize is that these students are in multi year degree programs so you have recurring revenue (that is deferred) and paid over time as a student pursues a degree program from beginning to end overtime. So if revenue is slowing that also means spend is slowing unless CAC is going up massively and LTV is dropping and there has been zero indication of that. In fact it is the reverse, as the ARPU is expanding and the CAC to LTV is improving considerably as they spend more on higher ARPU programs and less on the RN to BSN programs at Aspen. So if slower growth means the company gets to break even sooner which is what they are communicated then I don't see what the issue is?You can't be in hyper growth and not spend money. You can't have it both ways and ultimately profitability at slower growth still creates real value.",
Lakestreet is giving it 4x FY2020 revs arriving st 9 bucks. The 4x rev multiple is being used it’s just that revs are reduced. I think that’s more than fair. 9 bucks in a year is a nice gain. Best of luck!,
"I don't think $100m in 5 years is unrealistic. That's assuming 20-25% growth from here. A 3.5x-4x revenue multiple or high teens ebitda multiple isn't unreasonable if they are showing good margins. The author overshot but if the company can continue to scale even at a more modest rate, it will be worth a lot more. In 5 years, pre-licensure business should be worth well over $100m by itself and that biz has 30% ebitda margins at scale. Just takes time. Chamberlain has 30K students and 4% enrollment growth and a 20x plus PE and they have been around forever. The demand for nurses isn't going away and Aspen has the best value proposition and keeps increasing market share so I am not concerned just because the market panics in the short term.The market dynamics for the business have only gotten better so I'm not going to worry what a sell side analyst thinks who covers 35 stocks and doesn't have time to do industry due diligence. It takes time to grow a business. The stock market is good at weighing volatility and allowing people to trade. It doesn't grow businesses.",
I was bashing the author who I find annoying in how he responds to others who contest his worldview. It’s one thing to say that a chart might be indicative but not dispositive it’s another to ridicule it as tarot card reading. He’s written up an article and used ridiculous valuation metrics comparing apples to oranges and making up his own “revenues”. The CEO clearly stated the value of their contractural revenue was 45 million! Then based on silly metrics he “compounds” it and arrives 500% higher in 4 years when he’s 50% under in a month!,
"Then why didn't you sell? You said in your prior post you bought more at $4.95? I'm confused. You like to bash your own stock? At $42m in revenue, the company currently trades at 2.2x next yr's revenue. So if you think that a company with 25% growth should at 2x revenue or less then yes it should be valued at $4.50. Or maybe you think they won't grow next year after growing 60 percent this year? If they do $34m next year than yes, I agree it would be worth $4.50, but I don't think the company is going to have flat Y/Y growth. I think people are panicking because numbers have come down. But I also think its possible the company is sandbagging after growing 60% this year and seeing their stock fall 40%. Why would they want to be aggressive?",
Might want to read Lakestreet Partners recent analysis cutting numbers. No disrespect to the author of this piece but it was pretty clear his numbers were fictional. Follow the money. The chart says bottom is in at $4.50. Given price target reduced to $9 based on FY20 numbers $4.5 seems fair. Two articles now have described ASPU as a annual compounder. For now the only thing compounded are the authors’ losses.,
"No no I’m not actually a nurse I was just wondering how it works logistically. Anyway, you’ve done your homework! It’s gonna be just fine. I think the momo players are out and once he is ebitda positive (if not there he’ll be close next Q) then the tide will turn and like you said this will be right st 7 or so before you know it. Thank you for your very insightful responses. Been a pleasure.",
I don't know if USU has local clinical relationships yet in Boston. I am sure if you contact them they can tell you whether they are live in Boston or will be live soon.,
I quite enjoy talking to you! I just more at 4.96 because if you! But I don’t quite understand something. USU is in San Diego. I’m a nurse in Boston that what’s the FNP degree from USU. I can attend - do my work on-line and clinical at a local Boston affiliated hospital? How exactly does that work?,
"All I can tell you is that Adtalem owns Chamberlain Bursing, the largest nursing school in the United States with over 30K students. They have 6K FNP students. Walden owned by Laureate has 5K FNP students. So, given the fact that Aspen has the lowest cost FNP program in the country and is 30% lower than these other schools that don't have the flexibilty to lower price and given that the Aspen CEO has high growth ambitions, I am pretty confident that the FNP program can scale to atleast 3500 students over time. They said on the conf call that they have over 60 clinical relationships now so as they add more that will allow the program to scale. Nurses need to have a local hospital or clinic that they can attend in order to complete the clinical part of the degree program and if USU wants to enroll students from all 50 states, they will need to keep expanding their clinical relationships.The other thing here is that as Aspen becomes more vertically integrated and expands its pre-licensure program, they will have more nurses in their system and these will become organic leads to come back to Aspen to compelete graduate degrees overtime.",
"You really know this company! Bravo! I agree wholeheartedly with just about everything you said. Let me ask you this: with USU his enrolling 900 students a year, or 150 every other month. Is their a capacity limit? In other words, can the San Diego campus only accommodate so many?",
"What I would say is that the orignal Aspen U business that is focused on RN to BSN education is a very competitive industry with low barriers to entry. Many schools in the field. It is easy to be in this business because there is no clinical element to the teaching so barriers are low. Therefore, growth has slowed as the business has grown to close to $30m in revenues. The business also has a lower ARPU per student of around $7500 so despite having over 6500 students, its hard to generate a lot of revenue when the ARPU isn't that high. That said, growth coould be higher in the RN to BSN business but when you have a mid  25% ROIC in the Aspen business and a 50% plus ROIC in the FNP and a 100% ROIC in pre-licensure, the company should re-allocate marketing dollars to the higher return programs so you can't look at it as if the core is slowing, you have to look at the return on spending and the fact that ARPU is increasing relative to acquistion cost. I think the fact that they pivoted the business and acquired USU was a fantastic strategic move. The challenge has been that in order to make this pivot, they went from being profitable to unprofitable and to spend upfront to build out the infrastructure and revenues lag as they take time to ramp. The details are compelling. The new FNP program is on track to end the year with over 1000 studenst and the ARPU is around $18K and the first pre-licensure campus is open and has enrolled students and the ARPU is $42K. In addition the graduation rates for these programs are close to 80% much higher than the base business.I think we just have to be patient. The company should be close to adjsuted ebitda break even in Q4 and that should reduce skepticism and increase confidence. USU business should grow over 90% next year.  Just takes time.",
Unlike the author I use charts and I see bottom as 4.50. That to me is an ideal buy although I’m currentky long and I’ve been buying since about $5.70,
"Are revs expected to grow 30 or 25%? What are the margins on the new business? CEO stated north of 30 for USU FNP but program is young. He went from a simple RN to BSN and then branches out into unknown territory- one question is why? Was it because growth in traditional core ASPU was slowing? I think so. So a) we have some legitimate uncertainty about growth, margins etc as the FNP and BSN are new. Second, we presumably having slowing growth in the core business. Regardless, I agree with you if he can get revs to >100 million in 3 years or so with 30% margins that’s 1.5 a share or so x 15 market multiple and stock is 20 bucks.",
"Can you provide a comp of another education company growing enrollments above 10%? Strategic has high growth this year because they made an acquisition. Not sure why 2.5x multiple would be appropriate for a 30% grower. I don't know a single company growing 30% that trades at 2.5x current year revenue let alone forward revenue.I agree 6-10x is too high, but 2.5x  doesn't make sense to me when Match.com trades at 8x revenue for 20-25% growth and the average user is trying to get off teh site as quickly as possible.  In the long run, if Aspen can continue growing and get to $100m in revenues it will be worth alot more than $6.70 either way.",
"Let’s think this through. First, I don’t believe company deserves a Edtech valuation. It’s on line for profit company so give it comparable comps. Stop with the 6x projected revs reserved for high flying SaaS companies. Moreover, although public it’s not a very liquid market given how thin it trades. Those funds that bought at $7.15 less than a year ago are looking pretty silly. So let’s give it 2.5 times next year FY 20 revenues. FY 19 Revs will be approx $34 million (we know this Q is $8.8 and I’m assuming $10.8 for 4thQ (their best Q). If they can grow revs 30% YOY then FY20 we should do approx $50 million. Give thatva 2.5 multiple and it’s 125 million mkt cap. With 18.5 million shares out that’s $6.70 a share. This is reasonable and much more realistic than the author of the article. It’s easy to get fanciful slicing and dicing numbers and assuming ridiculous valuations comparing apples to oranges. Expect a 30% gain from here but you’ll need to be patient.",
"CEO did a horrible job of managing the Street the last year. Despite growing 65% somehow numbers have been taken down the last 3 quarters and now taken down for next FY2020. Had a secondary at $7.15 and all the growth and momentum players lost money have mostly sold out putting downward pressuer on the stock. I actually think the stock is now compelling as the Street has reset expectations and the CEO is eating CROW. Expecattions are now for only 25% growth next year and the stock trades at 2.2x forward revenue. If the company can start exceeding expectations, it will get a multiple turn and a 50% return from here is pretty reasonable. I think its worth $8 in a year if management is smart enough to sand bag guidance for next year and go out and beat some lowered numbers.",
"Regardless, I’ll say this: the CEO is doing an amazing job. The purchase of USU and the FBP program is getting momentum; the pre-licensure hybrid campus is up and was fully booked with a minimum of marketing expense proving that the demand is there. Once he starts to demonstrate leverage the stock should be 8 -10 dollars.",
On the CC an analyst spoke to this: FY 2019 earnings estimates were approx 49 million. This is why the same analyst said that a monster 4thQ was needed (seasonally their best Q). Yes I know the difference between calendar and fiscal year.,
"I sent you an email via SA. About 6 months analysts were modelling/estimating for FY19 $45 million. It’s looking closer to 32 million. Although that might have been mgmt’s decision, that’s quite a haircut. Anyway, I’m thinking this: by end of 4thQ FY 19 they should have close to 12,000 active student body. If median LTV across all segments is $12,000 that’s $144 million. What would be an appropriate multiple based on LTV for the for profit Ed sector? Any thoughts?",
"The chart is terrible, with a clear decline that is not a good indicator for me. I don't care what investors think about a company, I determine what I believe based on the chart as a starting point.  The chart shows distribution, not accumulation which is what smart money is doing. I would never own a stock unless the chart was clearly in a strong accumulation mode, not someone writing a 'thesis"" to justify owning shares that have been in a long-term downtrend.  I would buy only if the chart was in agreement. The travel guide says the road is clear, but the map shows delays. No thank you.",
Superb job. Got to love a company whose IR contact is the CEO. Now long. Thanks.,
All this is the reason why I have been a holder of this company for over eight years.  I believe the breakout comes in the next 12 months.  I am confident that Mike and the talented team he has put together will take this to much higher valuations. Go Aspen!,
"The marketing for this business is done direct to consumer. Therefore, getting to cash flow break even within the current balance sheet should not be an issue as they scale revenue, and dial back G&A and marketing spend. Plus as the author points out, they have access to a line of credit, which they should be able to expand if needed as they reach break even.Company has the low cost product in a durable market with a nursing shortage.

Thanks!! Good write up.,Time To Put Halcon Out Of Its Misery
"Since this article is originally about the clinical hold on AFM11...We haven't yet discussed the new info we got today from the poster regarding the (very unfortunate) patient death.The death wasn't from CRS.  Wasn't even from neurotox...It was from cardio-respiratory arrest...in a septic patient.  It does mention that the patient was neutropenic, and this neutropenia could be related to AFM11.  Otherwise It isn't clear to me how this death was ""assessed as probably related to AFM11"".  Still, leukemia patients that have been getting blasted with multiple lines of chemo and have bone marrow full of leukemic cells are often profoundly neutropenic to begin with.  I wish we had a little more light shed on why investigators deemed this as probably related to AFM11, because it doesn't seem obvious given what we know (it would've been obvious if it were CRS or neurotox).  If this patient really died from complications of infection, there isn't a very strong case to shut the trial down permanently for safety concerns in my opinion - essentially every leukemia drug ever approved increases risk of infection and it is kind of a crap-shoot as to who gets the bad infections.",
"ASH AFM11 poster basically reiterates what we already knew.1/3 (33%) CR so far in what looks to be target dose (cohort 5) with MRD achieved.Interestingly the CR/MRD rates for Blincyto were 32% and 31% respectively in its registrational trials.  So with an extremely small sample size and safety concerns in the max dose (above the target dose), AFM11 is looking a lot like Blincyto.What I'd like to know is if any of the patients in the AFM11 trial have had prior CD19 targeted therapy.  There shouldn't have been any post-CD19 therapy patients in the Blincyto trials ""back in the day"".  If there are any CD19 refractory patients in the AFM11 trials that would make it markedly more difficult to get responses.For now I think the data justifies continued study of AFM11 in ALL from both the company's and the FDA's perspective.",

Stock up big but why aren't they releasing a PR with all the numbers ? I don't understand,
6 out of 30 patients were eligible to stemcel transplant already. Amazing after 4 previous lines of treatment. AFM13 treatment should be a first line of therapy.  I fully agree with Kevin Porter.,
A Photograph of AFMD's AFM13 poster for tonight is going around.  The results look really good!  The CR rate has continued to rise since the last update!---46% CR approximately doubles the CR rate of pembrolizumab monotherapy (the biggest news in my opinion)---88% ORR---100% of the patients had already failed brentuximab vedotin (awesome and important to see that the CD30 target is not exhausted by prior targeted therapy)---100% of patients were at least at 4th line therapy---Some patients were getting AFM13+Pembro as their EIGHTH line of therapy!---Looking durable with 77% 6 month PFS---Very safe - only 2/30 patients had DLTs and these only required temporary cessation of treatment with standard care resolving the problems - these 2 patients resumed the AFM13 treatment shortly and nobody discontinued the study,

"Thanks to the author for bringing this clinical hold up timely for first clinical data on AFM11 at the upcoming ASH meeting and thanks to the critical comments with the enlightening discussions.Also most is said I'd like to note 3 things: 1) the title is attractive but not well founded 2) it is important to distinguish Neurotoxicity from CRS.3) there is more to AFM11 within Affimed focus on NK-cell engagement(1) ""Affimed Clinical Hold Likely To Be Resolved Soon"" is nonsenseThis is to say that we simply don't know what ""soon"" and ""resolved"" could mean in the context of this clinical hold. A ""soon"" would originally have implied something of a matter of days but this already has taken 7 weeks now and it may still take some month to ""resolve"". That 'soon' can accumulate to several quarters and the updated time-lines on clinical-trials suggests an expected 9-12 month delay. That may still be 'soon' for a multi-year trial.Now for what would ""resolve"" mean - on first read one may assume ""lift of clinical hold"" and ""continuation"" of the trials but it may also ""resolve"" in a complete stop of the trials and abandon of the AFM11 project. Affimed own wording currently is ""Affimed assessing all AFM11 program data and working with global health authorities to determine next steps; update to be provided upon completion of the evaluation"" (see company presentation slide 19 www.affimed.com/... )So it is pure speculation if the hold will be lifted and at what time! We just know that Affimed plans to have a program update at ASH and AFM11 strategic options to ""Continue to advance to proof-of-concept"".(2) Neurotoxicity versus CRSThe use of SAE, CRS and neurotoxicity is taken very much like synonyms here but they are not. CRS and neurotoxicity are typical adverse events (AE) in Anti-CD19 T-cell therapies and can both be graded as serious i.e. SAE as was nicely pictured for CRS in the article. CRS is often seen as a good sign but unwanted side-effect of efficacy that can be well controlled while neurotoxicity is often associated with CRS but not strictly or severity correlated and mostly not controllable with the CRS medication. Neurotoxicity indicates activity in the brain and that is in general to be avoided.  From some analysts like Sun-trust we know that the 3 SAE that lead to one death and the clinical hold of AFM11 have all been neurotoxicity related. This might have important implications on the program and the potential steps to avoid or control these SAE. For a good discussion see experience from Juno CAR-T clinical holds and final abandon of JCAR015 i.e. this follow-up analysis cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/... ).(This is not to say that AFM11 will have to be abandoned like JCAR015 but an indication that special steps may be needed to control AFM11 application!)(3) AFM11 CD3 T-cell engager program vs. Affimed's CD16a NK-cell engagersIn my opinion the clinical hold and circumstances as well as the first data as to be reported at ASH seem to confirm important insights that Affimed already featured in previous pre-clinical work at ASH 2015 comparing AFM11 as T-cell engager with an CD19 NK-cell engager candidate named AFM12 with the following conclusion:""Affimed’s CD19/CD3 and CD19/CD16A TandAbs with identical anti-CD19 tumor-targeting domains but different effector cell-recruiting domains represent interesting molecules to study T-cell- or NK-cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches. The comparison of AFM11 and AFM12 demonstrated that AFM12-mediated lysis was fast and efficacious, and AFM11 showed higher potency. In summary, the NK-cell recruiting TandAb AFM12 represents an alternative to T-cell recruiting molecules, as it may offer a different side effect profile, comparable to that of AFM13, the first NK-cell TandAb in clinical development""Even more interesting from that pre-clinical work is the comparison with an Anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor reading as:""• Anti-PD-1 inhibited tumor growth with similar efficacy as AFM12 in an ALL PDX model, whereas tumor growth control by AFM11 was slightly more efficacious.• Combination of AFM11 or AFM12 with anti-PD-1 substantially augments tumor growth control in both combinations.• A triple therapy with AFM11, AFM12, and anti-PD-1 not only prevented tumor growth but induced shrinkage of tumors.""These insights in my opinion show a potential explanation and highlight future directions to a true resolution of the AFM11 clinical hold that I interpret as follows:Both kind of TandAbs AFM11 and AFM12 have single activity that is comparable to Anti-PD1 application. The effect of all three depends on the number of available immune cells. The effect of the T-cells (AFM11) is stronger but more disruptive than the smooth dose-controlled effect of the NK-cells (AFM12). This disruptive activation with strong binding of T-cells makes AFM11 most powerful but difficult to control (or dose) given individual differences in the number of activatable T-cells available (which may also explain the toxicity in the brain). This may require individual dosing regimes depending on T-cell counts or other BioMarkers.The future solution: smooth incremental dosing of AFM12 guided by BioMarkers followed by same using AFM11 and finally combined with Anti-PD1 for a complete, permanent eradication of cancers.This last triple combination is the most interesting aspect for me and may hopefully turn out to be a key value driver of future clinical approaches for Affimed ROCK platform that can generate both kinds of engagers for the same targets.

"To correct my valediction in my above response to A. May, it should have read:My regards and thanks to A. May",
"Enlightening comment. Thank you for a very clear explanation. I too wonder if UCART19 can continue to meet that very high bar"" as you noted with an 80%+ CR Rate. For the sake of very sick patients, I hope it does.It sounds like AFM11 is another ""class"" and will be used in a different tier with the CAR-T treatments in these deadly diseases. Let's hope that AFM11 can surpass blinatumomab with its performance. From what little info is out there, it looks promising. Here's to positive results soon to be disclosed at ASH. I remain ""hopefully optimistic""!Regards A. May",
"I only have a small stake in AFMD as I bought in after the Clinical Hold on AFM11. Obviously, I am vert intrigued by the Roche/Genentech collaboration and AFMD's ""ROCK"" Platform. But I am looking for more insight into AFMD's CAR-T program, namely AFM11.I am well aware that other companies (those with existing therapies: Juno and Kite and their respective acquirers), as well as ongoing studies by Pfizer and Allogenic with UCART19. I am also aware that all have had similar SAE's to the one experienced with AFM11. That is why I am very optimistic that the CH will indeed be lifted and enrollment will continue.Other than the vague comments released by AffirmedMD as to ""a few patients in the other cohorts (lower doses) have had positive clinical responses""...and I'm paraphrasing and going off memory - though a fading memory, what makes AFM11's prospects different from, and hopefully brighter that the currently available treatments, as well as with the success of UCART19? And what is meant by ""off the shelf"" with AFM11 vs. existing treatments?I read somewhere that UCART19 has a CR rate in excess of 80% in 30+ evaluable patients. What are the feelings here as to how AFM11 might stack up in this area and what are the long term chances for success given that AFM11 is AFMD's most advanced NME? I'm curious to read your comments and those of other notable posters. Sure, I can do the DD/research myself, as I have, but I would like to hear other opinions. Thanks, MC",
"""Cytokine release syndrome [CRS] is a common side effect of many FDA-approved oncologic drugs (source)."" This is misleading: all examples in the paper you cite relate to - still fairly exotic - Car-T therapies and the T-Cell engager Blincyto. That's less of a handful of 'FDA-approved oncologic drugs'. CRS is not an issue for the vast, vast bulk of oncology drugs outside of cell-based therapies.",
"I actually think that aside from creating creditibilty for the street, removal of the hold is a relatively minor event for the longer term. The hold created ""noise"" around the truly transformational event of the Roche deal. Trying to acsribe a ""valuation"" at this point in time is fairly usless in my view as we are speculating on trial results of a series of compounds. I will say the momentum players on the street will run this up towards and perhaps even above the high we saw, say around $7.50. My plans to take profits above $7 on a portion of my holdings were disrupted by the hold, but when i read here and elsewhere the nature of the hold being more about dosage than effacey, I started buying April 2019 calls on dips to replace any shares I took profits on. I spent some time looking at how other biotechs perform in similar type deals ALLO comes to mind so my hope is eventually a much highr price for AFMD shares but I will be steely eyed and ready to take profits along the way.",
"Before the Genentech deal, AFMD had about USD50mn in cash (=$0.80 / share) and stock price was about $1.60. i.e. the market was valuing AFMD's entire pipeline (AFM13, AFM11 etc.) at $0.80. Yet, when the clinical hold was announced, the SP fell by about $1.50. Frankly, it's not possible to say with much accuracy how strong the market will react to any lift of the clinical hold.",
"I actually thought it was a very informative article, I had questions on the clinical hold.  Price drop/increase predictions are wrong a lot of the time. By my calculations the stock will be 5.85 after the hold is lifted, does that make you feel better lookout?",
"What a pointless article. You are basically saying that if the hold if lifted the stock goes up. If it doesn't then it goes down. Well, duh... You don't actually explain why the magnitude the stock could move up or down is 20%. This is quite critical. Btw, the analyst at Suntrust provides their value of the stock. This doesn't mean that the market also values the stock in the same way so saying that Suntrust values AFM11 as so-and-so % of the value of the stock is not very useful.",Affimed Clinical Hold Likely To Be Resolved Soon
