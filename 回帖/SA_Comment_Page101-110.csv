Does anyone know if Corning is going to be involved in producing the foldable screens that will start coming out on some phones this year?,
I’m a communications engineer. All my clients required Corning products to be sole sourced into my specs . With 5G coming their is going to be massive amount of fiber needed to communicate to the pole mounted 5G antennas.  Downside is minimal here over the next decade,

"Great article, Great Company! I only have one complaint regarding GLW fiber (although I am sure this is also true of other fiber manufacturers) which I would greatly appreciate if they would spend some R&D to correct. I use 200' - 1000' rolls of GLW fiber daily. These are ok for aerial use, however, when I have to pull the fiber through interduct, it tends to twist up on itself. This results in multiple trips back and forth to where the roll is in order to untwist it. Yes, I could roll out the entire length, but then you have to worry about it snagging on something or some idiot driving over it.For this one small reason, I curse them daily. Other than that, a fine investment!",

"@bill Maurer:Thanks for a much more balanced article. On two of your bullet points:- “4,000 down to 3,500” - 4,000 comes from your Venturebeat link. I have yet to see anything written by anyone else inferring a loss of clients or the 4,000 number. Perhaps Venturebeat just got the number wrong?- “BlackBerry undergo restructuring once the deal is complete” - Chen/McClure make it very clear in the CC and especially in a lengthy interview, post announcement, www.bnnbloomberg.ca/... that they wish to run the two companies separate and will actually be adding staff to Cylance.What seems to be lost in the article is both McClure & Chen see this as 1+1=3 vs your inference that 1+1= 1 3/4. The verticals are extremely complimentary. BB UEM gets a huge boost by adding Cylance as well as BB’s automotive business model. Cylance gets BB’s low risk clientele base (govt, Fintek, hospitals etc) The BNNBloomberg interview clearly brings up the cross selling opportunities.What piqued my interest the most is this new announcement “Cylance Introduces AI-Powered Cloud Security Solution for AWS” Nov 26, 2018 www.bizjournals.com/...",

Cylance also has a high false positive rate that makes it cumbersome for customers to manage. They live in a VERY crowded space with 6-7 larger EMM vendors owning the majority of the large enterprise market (Trend Micro, Symantec, McAfee, Carbon Black, etc..)Chen is collecting a nice salary while and adding to his retirement plan...plenty of better tech investments over the last 5 years of Chen (where the BB pps gained about as much as a good bond).",

it expanded too quick  and has net debt over $1.1B. It also needs big money for the vessel upgrade before 2020.

"ESP, If you have already done your due diligence, you should have seen that their production numbers are not similar . Approximately over 2 Bcf compared to over 1.4 Bcf. They are not comparable. Unless you can show otherwise, GPOR only drills Utica wells in the Marcellus/Upper Devonian/Utica huge region. Neither RICE nor GPOR has indicated Marcellus prospectivity in the specific operations area. The Scoop/Stack is different altogether. Given COG's and others results testing Upper/Lower Marcellus wells, they have both those depths to drill. I hope that you are thorough, as given your statements, the article will be disected. As an aside, I prefer GPOR stock at this stage. I have problems with some of COG's statements in the past stringing along investors about the Constitution, and I do not buy their  3000 remaining well inventory. They have thrown that number out since around 2010. Should that inventory have changed due to all the wells they have drilled since then, and given that longer laterals are being drilled and their acreage position has not been significantly added to if at all.",
"I do not have and I can not find CS report after Q3 results. According to budgeted capex for 2019, GPOR will save between 215-250m comparing with 2018 while the production will not decrease below Q4 level. This saving should help them to fund the buyback program.",
"I looked now for the CS report and I found the following report (I do not know if this is the report you have been referring to):research-doc.credit-suisse.com/...At page page 18 I see that at share price of 23.72 for COG and 11.28 for GPOR they show EV/ebitdx of 7.2 (2019e) for COG and 4.6 (2019e) for GPOR, EV/DACF for 2019e of 7.4 (COG) and 4.5 (GPOR) and Price/2P NAV of 0.98 for COG and 0.7 for GPOR.So at a share price below 9, things were looking even better for GPOR.Indeed we will see soon an updated picture for the two. Have a nice week!",
"When I buy a share I look to see if fundamentals show a high chance to make at least 50% in 2 years. If we look at GPOR the fundamentals have looked very strong over the last quarters and at any price below 10 it’s a bargain and I’m comfortable  that I will make the 50%. My cost is currently around 8. The market can not ignore the good results indefinitely and some big guns usually show up. In Q3 last year few large investors made significant acquisitions...LSV AM 6.9m shares, Citadel Advisors 5.8m (as reported for Sep) etc. FVP has done what I expect from a large active investor and unfortunately many times companies/management fail to deliver good returns because large investors and their representatives in the Board  are passive.",
"I know that it has been said before, but they should start paying a dividend...…...even a small one to start.",
"After they averaged down in q4 FVP managed to bring the cost for their 9.7m shares to 13.23 and I think they will be very active to determine much better capital allocation and to move the share price up over the next months. They have 60% of the 4.35m shares call options that expire in Jun 2019 at a strike of 12.5, so I think they want to avoid to have these options out of money by June 2019. Based on the operational data published, GPOR will report revenue of about 416m for q4 2018, which I think is all time high for quarter. With a capex of about 80m in the quarter they should have nice positive FCF for q4.",
"Great news for GPOR's shareholders, buyback budget of 400m for 2019 (more than 25% from current market cap, after they bought back more than 10% from the company in 2018) and cut of capital expenditure by 215-250m in 2019 vs 2018 should bring significant free cash flow. Despite the fact that they have just said it will be over 100m for 2019. With the higher production in 2019 (in line with Q4 from 2018) should allow them to make easily 150m FCF in 2019.Very good thing that Firefly Value Partners stepped in and put pressure on management to improve capital allocation.Having in mind that FVP have bought more than 9.7m share at an average price of 13.23 and have 4.35m call options, they will look closely at what management will do going forward.GPOR should be over 15 in few months.",
"@Michael Fitzsimmons ;I recently added more shares under $7. Look at the metrics of today's bid for QEP. I know QEP is more oily, but very similar stuff going on - a PE firm inside kicking the tires, and a new CEO at GPOR whom is from PE I believe.My only concern is a low ball buyout - like $10 a share...ESP",
Currently trading seems crazy and computers are playing. Every day 5% of the company change hands. I hope the management has used the remaining 90m to buy back another 7% from the company. This would improve event more the metrics per share. This period is a great opportunity to add cheap oil and gas shares. What is happening with natural gas companies is illogic and for sure will offer great opportunities for juicy medium term returns.,
I’m very comfortable with GPOR and I will see good return on the investment...you can not always buy at min and sell at max. In my opinion currently it is misprized. Q4 will be solid and price will go up sharply in q1.,

"Some of your units are incorrect. In the table COG should be either 2.03 Bcfe/d or 2,030 MMcfe/d.",
"In a year time GPOR will double the current price...with a capex at 500m they would easily make $1.5 fcf/share. If they have used in q4 the remaning 90m for buy-back program they will cut the no of shares below 163m from 183m at start of the year. As I said before, this is one of the best shares in the energy sector for a value investor.",

I'm looking to continue swimg trading this one with around 65% of my account. I'm surprised it took such a hit these past few weeks since it's hardly in the oil business.

"Mike - GPOR also owns a 22% interest in Mammoth Energy (TUSK) and, while TUSK has fallen along with everything else, it is still worth about $250 million. Additionally, on the last call GPOR said that their capital spend was forecast to decrease ""significantly"" in Q4 as they plan to turn to sales 7 wells, so we may see some improvement in FCF metrics in the coming quarters. I own GPOR and added some stock today and sold June '19 7.5 puts for a $0.75 credit.

"Michael:Thank you for the article, and highlighting GPOR, which I think is an undervalued equity.Specific to COG, which I also like, I think GPOR is more undervalued, though I like COG's exposure in Appalachia more than GPOR's main basins.Having said that, I think there are several other Appalachia plays are cheaper than COG, and GPOR too, with SWN being the most undervalued.  I have a table in the following blog article that shows this comparison earlier in 2018, and I will update this at year-end.seekingalpha.com/...With where I think natural gas prices are going, and that is higher across the curve, I think GPOR, COG, and SWN will be major winners over the foreseeable future, though I think total return potential for these three is SWN first, GPOR next, and COG third, simply because COG is already valued at a premium valuation, as others in this comment section of this article have indicated.WTK",
"Michael, Thanks for the articles. I simply cut this part out of my COG/EQT comment as neither issue appears to be covered. To me the possibility of the midship, being in Oklahoma, is more likely than COG getting greenfield takeaway in NEPA as a wildcard.A huge catalyst for GPOR would be the final ok, and building out of the Midship project. Another catalyst would be the closing of a significant part of their current TUSK position valued at about $245 million. (Somewhat non-liquid due to it being 10.8 million shares or 22% of the company.) I believe that they have sold about 1 million shares this year. Great move in my opinion, and rolling it into GPOR stock is very wise at these prices. I am long GPOR at around $9. I agree that COG's source dry gas rock is superior. What could give GPOR higher return than currently, is that they have liquids available to develop in both locations. Price can move development to dry or wet as strip prices justify. They also get a Btu bump in realized prices when there is Ethane rejection. ""The Midship project is designed to deliver 1.44B cf/day of gas from STACK and SCOOP to existing pipelines near Bennington, Okla., for transport to Gulf Coast and southeast markets where demand for the fuel for domestic consumption and liquefied natural gas export is growing.Cheniere filed an application to build Midship in May 2017; the company has said it was targeting completion of the project in early 2019.""",
I would be more in a mood to add a lot of shares if they stopped buying back shares and switched to paying down debt.,
At current prices GPOR is better pick comparing with COG...at least for me it's a easy choice if I have to decide between the two.,
"In Q3 GPOR had positive free cash flow of 22m while COG had -18m, so even if we consider that in Q4 COG will generate FCF of 200m and GPOR 130m, this would translate in a much better FCF ratio for GPOR (FCF per share/share price).If we consider your estimate for next year of 650m for COG we would have a ratio of 6.25%, so GPOR will have to generate only 93m FCF for 2019 in order to reach the 6.25%.If GPOR will generate 250m in 2019 (a much more conservative estimate than the 650m for COG), the ration would be 16.7%, well above COG (6.25%).SCOOP is helping GPOR to increase the NGL % in total productions which I think it's very positive, as we will see an increase in exports.In terms of leverage, COG and GPOR have more or less the same debt to equity ratio (64% GPOR and 61% COG).",
Any sense about whether gpor hedges allow for capturing upside like swn or is it a fully locked hedge at that price?,
"Why your strong emphasis on free CF?    Most driller's cash flow goes right back into CAPEX to maintain or grow production and reserves.    GPOR is producing strong cash flow which should be in the area of $800 million for full year 2018.    Debt is about 2.5 X cash flow, not an aggressive level.   Some drillers are up in the 4-5 X area  (SWN was) which is getting risky with unpredictable  prices for oil, dry gas, and NGLs.GPOR and others like SWN likely being held back by the poor ability to write hedges over $3.00 for dry gas going past March 2019.      In spite of recent rises in prices for this winter, prices for April '19 and other ""out"" months are still rather weak and have improved very little.Kel","Gulfport Energy: Higher Risk, Higher Reward"

"Nouveau Monde Graphite has been granted $1,188,225 by government agencies for work related to innovation.  This is money that the company will not need to pay back.  It was also given a loan by Investissement Quebec at a favourable interest rate.  My understanding is that this loan is to be paid back once the company receives its mining credit that are currently shown as receivables on the balance sheet.This total amount of $5,843,225 will allow the company to operate a few additional months before it needs to raise additional cash for funding operations and the development of the value-added production line for making uncoated purified spherical graphite and expanded graphite.  The company’s demo plant is currently producing 3 tonnes of graphite concentrate per day and they have customers for this material.   I am thus expecting the company to update us about the selling of these tonnes of concentrate with these prospective long-term clients.  Hopefully the market will recognise that the company not only produce very good quality flakes but also see what is coming in 2019 with the UPSG and expanded graphite production line.  A tonne of UPSG of 10 micron currently sells for $4,400 USD.  I have spoken to their R&D staff working on the purification process and these guys are very confident they will come up with an innovative thermal purification process.  I also like the fact that the company works with Hydro-Quebec’s battery lab personnel in setting up this UPSG production line.

"It is not a good approach to look at analysts perspective and sum up the conclusions. They are all employed by institutions who have proven disgusting track records. YoY stats(Q1-2017 Vx Q1-2018)   Rev : $3.97B to $8.0B (100% Growth)   EPS : 2.45 to 3.0 (20+% Growth)  Why are analysts and articles here ignoring the above facts  ?  With DRAM/NAND pricing drop of 10~15% in this quarter,  Micron still has Gross Margins @50+% and Net profit margins of 40%.   We all know that DRAM spot pricing has no direct one to one corelation to the actual profits of Micron.  We have several parameters like product mix, high margin products. Bit density of sold products is intentionally ignored and instead the DRAM/NAND pricing is compared to per GB and conveniently ignoring the bit density in the next generation products which is 2 to 5x higher.  Marginal costing on goods mislead many ignorant and think companies are losing money. Products will be priced at marginal costs when manufacturer profits already covered all the expenses and every penny above making costs directly adds to the profits. So i do not think Micron or for that matter any DRAM/NAND maker is losing profits. They are just stable/stagnant until US/China trade settled and new technologies like 5G/IOT/Embedded(Autos) drive the demand further to make them secular.  The year end holiday sales usually go on huge marginal costing and that is why we see price drops. Sales volume will speak here.

Thanks Quad 7 Capital,
Nevin S.Buyback is 50% plus of Free cash flow.. 10 B should take 2.5 years.,
"First of all, thanks Quad 7 for the article.   Ian Croci, yes, the buyback was good for shareholders at $50/share and it's even better now in the $30s.   When they first announced the buyback I did some quick math and figured that they would probably (not potentially) buy back 22-25% of the outstanding shares over the next  2-2 1/2 years.   When announced they had a market cap of approx. $80 Bil.  Buyback = $10 B in the first year and then say $8 B in year 2 then at least another $4 B in the first half of year 3.   Of course there are two risks to this; 1) DRAM prices just collapse, and 2) they find other uses for FCF (more on this below). Looking forward to earnings (DEC. 18), based on Sanjay's comments today it doesn't look like earnings are at risk but then we never know what he will give for forward guidance (not that I'm worried).   So the risk here is deteriorating market conditions both in memory or macro economy.   As for semi conductor market every earnings call transcript I've read during the most recent earnings season shows that, yes, there seems to be a slowdown but it also is in several very specific areas.   Here are a few examples:   Taiwan Semi:   Weakness in known areas including industrial (read industrial controls or microcontrollers) and high end smart phones.   Well, we knew this or should have based on pricing and reception of new iPhones.   With regards to industrial sector, the slowdown of industrial production and slowing of GDP growth in China should have been the clue here.   LCRX:   Notes that slowdown in customer spending is primarily in memory and specifically NAND.   Modest growth in logic, foundry and DRAM (here every participant has indicated that they are spending towards a target of 20% bit growth this year - hardly a move to oversupply).    Cypress Semi:   Investor conference today CEO noted that they have seen a slowdown in the last quarter but this seems to be related to tariffs/trade war issues not the usual culprit in a cyclical peak (over expansion on supply side).   I suggest you read this in its entirety because he goes on a length about this issue.   All that said, we could go lower from here.   Who knows?   But when we emerge on the other side of this downturn we know that EPS will be much higher due to much greater discipline by producers as well as buybacks at MU.    The question over China's entry into this market should be dismissed now that Micron has filed civil action and Justice Dept has filed criminal case against them and imposed and injunction against purchases of Chinese pirated DRAM products as well as the sale of production equipment necessary to make chips.   And the final point I would make is that some time in the latter half of 2019 we will probably see Google flip the switch on the first data center to use crosspoint memory and then even if there appears to be an impending slowdown in DRAM end markets we will be sitting on the only company with a commercially viable next generation product.   I think you could also make the case that by late 2019 we will see the rollout of 5G handsets which means that 5G  networks will have been built and demand drivers for data and bandwidth will be in place to drive even greater demand for DRAM.",

"You're sure giving UBS a lot of unfounded credit by saying that they were right with their prediction from early April which included a revised share price forecast to $35.Yes. They were correct at predicting DRAM price decline. But by all appearances, they were expecting this to be more severe. They were completely wrong about MU having already demonstrated peak earnings by April, for as we all know, MU earnings were highest the last time they reported.UBS ultimately gave MU a negative forecast in April because they were betting MU's earnings would have significantly declined by now. So far, there is no evidence of a drastic drop in EPS.See for yourself from the larger portion from which your link quoted:""EPS guidance and think MU is ~2Qs away from a cycle of potentially significant estimate cuts primarily due to a near-term wave of DRAM supply; in 20+yrs of history, the stock has not worked during such periods. After estimates come down, we do see the potential for MU to re-rate higher out the other side to reflect these structural inflections, but we think fighting these cuts through 2H:18 and 2019 (we are ~40% below Street for CY2019E) is going to be a losing battle. ""So while, as it is turning out, fighting MU's beaten down share price  in 2H 2018 seems to be a loosing battle, it is not due to the reasons given: MU has, as of yet not demonstrated any significant earnings cuts. As it turns out, share price suppression is due largely to fear from macro factors such as the trade war with China and, as you point out, the tired rhetoric endlessly regurgitated by analyst that MU is cyclical. Not so much from anything as fundamental as actual earnings. This makes the case for frustration even greater.",

With projected 2019 revenue of 20-30M and a P/S similar to Biofire (5-7x), the current market value around $200M is, unfortunately, probably not too far off.  Clearly, T2 needsto increase its revenue ramp rate which seems anemic for a ""game changer"" technology.

I would have to think that the wanted to use high enough doses of 801 and 808 to obtain some effect.  This, although labeled “low” dose I still think they are attempting to improve on doublet (as you stated).  We’ll see soon enough.",
"There's a lot we do not know about Vertex compounds and also other like from PTI. FDA has been very undemanding to Vertex... based on the dramatic benefit of Kalydeco to  the 1st mutations addressed. Huge assumption, but if this FDA light touch prevails, then we can imagine an add-on market existing for Vertex compounds as long as DDI's are close to zero. This is a plan B at least one of the players. Expensive route though, has to be shown safe alone and in used combo... ie not just w orkambi, but Symdeco and soon the new triple. These barriers to a plan B, and plan As!, explain the continuing high market cap here.",
Terry.  Curious on whether you think low does triplet will have activity.  Looks like they don’t have a mid-dose so maybe the were informed from doublet and are starting off a bit higher.  Hope so.  It would be nice if they were around 7 percent improvement in fev1 but perhaps a big ask for low dose.,
"To keep to the headline here, the risk to vertex valuation does not start with FDA approval of a competitor! I'd say it starts with another company showing similar efficiency with better ddi's, tolerability or just 1xdaily. ""Showing"" means enough data to get investors worried - not happened, so far. And Vertex showed their small set of data was repeated in a P3, so they are in the clear, so far.",
"no matter how good PTI preliminary results will be, it will take them at least 3 to 5 years to get an approval for their potential triple. Just like with VX-561 FDA will require phase I - III studies for each component. PTI simply has not enough resources, it would need a cash rich partner who might be willing to compete with VRTX and potentially Abbvie.",

I'm thinking of it too... but Cornerstone is right about market very dangerous,
I bought some curaleaf today.,
Cornerstone I think what he is asking if u think Curaleaf is a good buy not after a huge sell off in the price .Also was wondering what your take on waiting to pull the trigger on any cannibus stocks now . Bec it seems like besides the mkt going down there’s also this lack of trust now Bec of the Aphria news. Was wondering if u think canopy rivers has the potential to go to 10 based on Cgc Being that they control a nice percent of the  company and will be out for they’re best interests . I rem like 20 years ago another incubator called CMGI and the stock went up like 7-8000 percent thanks,
Just wondering if you had a slightly better view given the company has lost roughly half of its market cap. I see it touching in the 4$ range us. That's a significant discount to the original price.  Thoughts?,
would sunniva be a good buy for curaleaf or trulieve,
Cornerstone who is your number one pic in the u.s mkt as that’s prob gonna be the biggest one.   And what’s your take on Cgc being left in the dust if in 3-5 years us is fully approved.  Do u think Cgc waits or makes indirect investments though canopy rivers to get into the us.  To me it’s mind boggling that Cgc with over 4 billion doesn’t make it there number one priority to be in the us even if not federally legal.

Curaleaf is now OTCPK:CURLF,
"I don't see Curaleaf averaging $6 mm per store on 2019. A $6 mm store is a healthy revenue generator, but I think many of their stores will either hit or even exceed this number. What I find hard to believe is a store that won't open until sometime in 2019 will generate $6 mm during a period that includes ramp-up. That's just not going to happen.

"How much does the rest of TGP's newbuilding program contribute in operating cash ?I see (1) 4x Yamal @ 50% ownership (2) Bahrain LNG terminal @30% ownership.Is $60M annually pre-interest reasonable? Using 40K cash-breakeven and 120K daily rate, produces $15M CFVO @50% share per vessel.I will briefly step away from all the in-the-weeds complexity and rely on simple observable metrics: Debt and Cashflow to get a rough estimate of the IDR value.All numbers in Millions and from TGP's filings.- Q1's total adjusted ebitda was 158, round to 150 after excluding tax and some questionable inclusions- Interest expense 65- Cashflow post interest 85. Contrast this +85 with +53 reported in Op Cash flow (+70 excluding Working capital changes). Let's say true cash flow is somewhere in between, i.e. 70-85- Assume 15/quarter from the remaining new-builds.- Cash flow = 85-100 per quarter = 340-400 annual.- Debt $3B. Amortize at 8% per year (or 240) leaving 100-160 for distributions (ignore the 5 towards pfd)- TK's highest IDR brackets require about 250, far away from the 100-160 range.- About $1.5B in debt needs to be paid off before reaching the 250 required for IDRs. That is a very long way awayThis simple model suggests that TK's IDRs are far out of the money for the foreseeable future, like 3 to 5 years.I am sure there are holes in this analysis but it is also a simple, easily falsifiable, definitely conservative model because it uses GAAP metrics. I have grown skeptical of having to squint real hard and make the model very complex in order to find value, I'd rather accept my limitations and place it in the ""too hard"" box.",

I was considering TGP but I lost faith in this sector.. Possible single digits this year..,
"TK has been trading ugly last weeks, especially since figures and relative to TGP and TNK :( Over the weekend JP Morgan came out with a 18$ (overweight, from 17$) target for TGP. Some interesting observations there. - They base the 18$ target on 9.5x EV/2019 expected EBITDA. Observation: if they use the same 9.5x on their estimated 2020 and 2021 numbers, then TGP price targets are set to skyrocket up (Expected EBITDA goes up a bit and EV down with debt paydowns). Estimated EPS: 2019-->  $1.63   2020 --> $1.92  2021 --> $2.07Estimated DCF per unit 2019 --> $3.09 2020 --> $3.5 2021 --> $3.74Deviding those yearly DCF numbers by 4, for quarterly figures. It looks like they expect (prior to IDR payments) TGP to report $0.77 , $0.875 and $0.935 of DCF per quarter for 2019, 2020 and 2020. It's good to see that their model comfirms the rapid debt paydown and cash flow ramp up. I think it's totally crazy to see that they don't give any meaningfull value to TK IDR's if they are also projecting $0.935 a quarter of DCF in 2021 ($0.65 is the start of the highest bracket). Probably because street analysts usually only look 1 year ahead and there is no clear vison/guidance from Teekay.",

"Very interesting thread and really enjoyed hearing the Bull and Bear cases for the TK Companies, but really this has been way over complicated from reality.I just don't see any real issues with the 2020 debt.  The Bond prices don't lie.  If there were an issue there is no way they would trade in the mid to high 90's.No the real issue is value.TOO in my view is the bargain here.  I would guess $300 million in operating cash flow foe the next 12 months (helped by the Petrobas settlement).  But so what as far as TK is concerned.  TOO is now just not that meaningfulfor them anymore.TNK has had a great quarter, but with OPEC reducing output who knows if it will last.And finally TGP.  Maybe the operating cash flows will finally come to be from the increases in CFVO.  So far it hasn't though.  TGP always has an excuse/one time item.  Until it actually delivers real cash flow it will remain in the dumps.  And make no mistake.  As goes TGP so goes TK.I find it somewhat surprising that J has thrown NMM under the bus for alleged management abuse.  I sure don't see it based on the decisions made on NMM.  And from a value standpoint based on EPS and real cash flows, NMM is a far superior investment based on current stock prices.Hockeyzan",

"The Teekay situation keeps getting worse with the large bond maturity approaching. Expect TK to repurchase more of the bond in the open market at current prices but that won't do it. Should high-yield markets remain closed, they might have to dilute heavily, make a deal for the TGP IDRs or find another solution like selling parts of their holdings in TGP, TOO and TNK (would be a terrible deal at current prices).There's no easy solution to this problem - perhaps J has an idea about the best path forward for TK here.Without a solution in sight, I expect the units (both TGP and TK) to underperform the broader market meaningfully.Perhaps selling parts of their TGP holdings at a sizeable premium to market might do it.",
Not sure he can go above 10% on the Teekay Group as a whole. His track record is quite good on his previous fund (Bestinver) but my feeling is that he took on too much risk on his come back fund (as you can see in the portfolio). His former team at Bestinver split and founded AzValor and then you have a new team at the helm at Bestinver. All this competitive pressure might have made them take on more risk than they could handle. It’s quite an interesting situation.,

"As best I understand it, the possible bearish (to one of the companies) scenarios are as follows:1) TK will not be able to meet their 2020 obligations without having TGP purchase the IDRs from them at some ridiculous price. This would imply TK is under-valued and TGP over-valued.2) TK will dilute heavily to meet their 2020 obligations. This implies TK is over-valued and TGP under-valued.3) TK sells the IDRs to a third party in order to meet their 2020 obligations. This implies TK is over-valued, and TGP under-valued. I believe this scenario is unlikely. The IDRs have less value to a third party, because they would have no sway over TGP's management. Suddenly the incentive would be for TGP to pay out distributions which minimized the impact of the IDRs.I did not include TGP waiting as long as possible for the largest possible distributions to TK, because I don't see how this scenario is bearish to either company. It's also what I expect to happen.No scenario I can think of imply both TK and TGP should be dropping, yet that is what is happening. Bears seem to be thinking the price action validates their thesis, yet nothing about TGP's future cash flows has changed. Someone is going to capture that cash; it's not going to be given away or set on fire. To anyone on the fence about whether or not TK will abuse TGP, the solution seems obvious: buy both companies.IMO it's a mistake to say price action (in)validates a fundamental thesis. Particularly in this case, where an ETF might be selling 1.3M TGP shares into a market crash.Am I missing anything?",
"@MattZN2 Jan 15 2020 is almost two years frorm now? Excuse me, I must have the wrong calender. No, it is not the same for bankers where debts sits in the structure, certainly not since TK does not control the whole structure, and the question that everybody and their sister seems to dodge is to what extent cash flows actually can be upstreamed to begin with.Also, and that relates to all of Teekay components, these assets need to perform over a 20-30 year period, not one quarter. It is a business, not a speculative bunch of assets held for sale from quarter to quarter.",
"I don't think there's any point trying to figure out valuation metrics while the stock market is spinning off its rails and oil prices are see-sawing wildly.  The market clearly isn't seriously looking at metrics for any stock right now.  It's stuck in a deep algorithmic trading rut.TK's FPSO's depend on higher oil prices, simple as that.  They get the base charters plus a piece of the action above $45 oil.  In terms of the 2020 bonds... well, in the conference call TK indicated that they have around $540M outstanding and a cash balance of $200M+, and that they intend to refinance the bond at a lower level.  That means they will spend a lot of their cash to bring down the bond balance prior to the refinancing.  With roughly 2 years to do it, it just doesn't seem to be that big a problem to me.TNK is in an interesting place, Q4 FCF is clearly going to be on the high side given that rates went well over $30K/day in the second half of the quarter and Aframax rates are still sky high even now.  For TNK it depends on supply and demand.  TNK is advantaged by a shift towards longer-haul routes (exports from the U.S. and West Africa going to Asia), advantaged by lower bunker prices due to low oil prices, advantaged by the huge amount of scrapping that happened in 2018 (particularly for the Afras).  But disadvantaged by OPEC cuts causing VLCCs to push into Suezmax service areas (again).  Disadvantaged by a demand fall-off if the world economy tanks (vs just slowing down).  And Disadvantaged by lack of floating storage demand.TGP is kinda trundling along on its own, oblivious to the rest of the world.I think some of the posters here are just trolling (particularly the low-comment posters who feel kinda like bots to me)... TK is not going to refinance $540M.  It will be a much lower amount and I doubt banks will have a problem with it.  The higher interest rates go, the more TK will find ways to pay-down the bond prior to any refinancing.  They have several options that do not require dilution, including bumping up dividends from the TGP and TNK daughter entities if they really felt they had to, monetizing the IDRs, or selling something.   They have 2 years to do it so even if some posters here are freaking out, I don't think TK is freaking out.--TNK has its own debt cycle to worry about, with $150M due in 2019, $150M in 2020, and roughly $400M due in 2021.  The 2021 balloon will have to be refinanced or paid down or both.  Whether it be TK debt or TNK debt, its probably all the same to the bankers so I do not think TK is going to push TNK dividends just to be able to pay-down TK debt.  It wouldn't be all that much money anyway, but it wouldn't be nothing.In TNKs Q3 presentation they showed 59% Suezmax and 54% Aframax days already booked for Q4 at $19000 and $19900 on average ($43M in earnings already in the bag), with 999 Suezmax and 708 Aframax spot days left.  At $30K/day the remaining days would be another $51M.  At $40K/day the remaining days would be another $68M.  So we are talking about $83M - $112M or so in spot earnings for Q4.  Yah yah, I know Aframax spot rates went north of $70K on some routes, but I'm trying to be conservative and we have to average over a month and a half.But I have no idea how that will translate to full balance sheet earnings for Q4.  The dividend policy is still in place.  There could very well be a dividend for Q4 and it could be as much as $40M.... so $0.15/share is possible.   At that level TK would get around $10M from TNK and TNK would accumulate another $43M-$72M in cash or so.Will TNK declare a dividend?  No idea... if they don't, then all that money will go into a really nice chunk of debt reduction.  I'd kinda like them to declare a dividend to wake up all wall street on the absurd $0.90 share price.-Matt",

"I don't understand the short thesis at these price points. Yes sentiment is against Teekay at the moment, but when a company is able and willing to repurchase a good chunk of their float, negative sentiment is a good thing for long-term shareholders. It's also a potential nightmare for shorts (e.g. UBNT).I can somewhat understand being short TK, because their story is going to take longer to play out than TGP's. But how much lower do you think it's going to go? Why not take your profits, and move on to the many much-better shorts out there?We're in a target-rich environment for short sellers. YETI is massively over-valued. If you think there's a recession coming, TSLA is doomed. There are lots of zombie biotechs out there with failed drugs and nothing but capital raises and dim hopes of foolish buyouts in their future.",
"Incredible how thinly traded TK is. You breathe on it, and the damn thing moves +/- 10%.",
they should cut the dividend and allocate more cash to the repurchase. a 5% yield makes no sense when the money can be better used,

"finance.yahoo.com/...TGP K1 gone as expected. 100M share repurchase program. (market cap is currently below 1 billion). “We believe that Teekay LNG’s common units represent compelling value and repurchasing them is currently the best investment we can make as the unit price does not fully reflect the underlying value of our business, our large and diversified contract portfolio totaling $10.6 billion(1) of forward revenues, and the strong LNG carrier market fundamentals, which is resulting in higher cash flows for the Partnership,” commented Mark Kremin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Teekay Gas Group Ltd. “This new common unit repurchase program is another component of our previously announced balanced capital allocation strategy, which will see the Partnership delever its balance sheet as a priority while also providing investors with a 36 percent increase in ongoing distributions, commencing in 2019. *This repurchase program will enable the Partnership to return some of the additional capital generated from the current strong LNG carrier market and early newbuilding deliveries to create long-term value for unitholders.*”",

This is a nice story. I like the TOO preferred most at the moment but will watch TK and TGP.,
all i have to say is if TK not buying these bonds back their crazyLast Trade Price$95.63	Last Trade Yield12.972%,
I think the best deal right now is selling 2020 2.5 puts at 50 which is a 20% return over 1 year,
does anyone no what the TK bonds are going for now 8.5 2020bid ask,
TK shareholders need new management and board members. Until that happens.....,
"So, any news on the board meeting yet? Are those Cobas funds open-ended, by the way? What happens if redemptions come flowing in?",
"new target is 2,7$ not 3,3$",
"The IDRs should indeed ""go.""  It's just a question of timing.No one will value the IDRs properly evidently for TK until they are either paid or have a few quarters under the belt of actually cash flowing to them.  The right solution is a win-win where they are bought out early without actual distributions having been made. That only happens at a low to fair valuation.  But there is a win-win in this one given the advantages that both sides have to it going away earlier rather than later.However, even in the worst case if TK shafted TGP and say got 18x multiple, the TGP valuation at 4x DCF more than offsets the downside from that.  I just simply refuse to create a base case where GPs always rape the LPs.    The history is changing, and I'm optimistic that especially where TK is has a board controlled by a not for profit trust, I don't see them being as draconian as they could be.We'll see.  We've got nothing but time on this one.  It's kind of a boring story here for the next 4 quarters.",
"I had a position at 7, doubled at 5, doubled again at 3.9, if it falls to 2 im happy because I can double my position again, if it goes to 7 im happy because I am making money. I think you see things differently when you keep liquidity  for when market goes dumb.",
@J Mintzmyer   Did TK hold the board meeting last week?  Did they take any decisions. Would appreciate your feed back if any out of the board meetings.,
If TK is in control of both TK & TPG why is owning TK worse than TPG.. Anyhow it doesn't matter as they are both in the dog house.. I'll be happy with $7 TK in 2019..,
"You would think its the end  not only  of TK/TGP but many other good names in the sector.  If the better names are are sick, TK looks to be in  intensive care.  I watch the bonds for a feel and they are sick right now.  Really does not make sense at this point but it is what it is as there is so much fear out there.",
"I sold my TK position today to tax-loss harvest the position, and have the money allocated instead to TGP instead, which I feel is a reasonable proxy since so much of TK's value is tied to TGP.  I feel TGP is a safer investment than TK right now (the only real risk is abuse by TK).  It's definitely a simpler story, and when it comes to shipping I've decided simpler is better.  It's when I try to string a series of events that need to occur for me to realize my thesis, that I've lost the most in shipping.  Management rarely does what I think best or in the best interests of their shareholders.If TK falls even further in early 2019 I'll likely add back.  I do think that there is a very high chance we could be back to $6 range by the end of the 1Q2019, so selling this was of course very risky, but I can't responsibly hold as much in the Teekay family as I would have been holding my large TGP position and the TK I held as well.  Within shipping, I'm trying to be more disciplined in my position sizing the way J is.Good luck to all.",
"Down 60% on this now, hurts so much",
Did TK any substantial decisions in their board meeting last week?  Any updates ?,
"the interview is behind a paywall, but he said something similar in his investor conference, watch from 1.43.40www.youtube.com/...he says, ""what is important is that the company will generate 450 million in FCF in 2019 and definitely in 2020, whether they allocate this to dividend or debt repayment is secondary.""",

I wouldn't pick on J. too much.  I think the TK group is the only one where he has completely missed the both the fundamentals and the story.  Heck even NMM which is down 40% from his recommendation has performed exactly as he predicted.  The market just hasn't responded.,

"JI enjoy your articles as much as the next guy and clearly you put a lot of work into them.But I can’t help but feel that your analysis is completely flawed from a fundamental perspective.  I’ve sadly not got the time to take a detailed article through the editing process but hear me out and I’ll do a quick back of the envelope which shows the whole thing is a financing scam.You claim that 11x EV/EBITDA is a reasonable multiple.  That would imply an asset return of 9.09% (1/11).  What would this imply for an equity return?Well, first off the EBITDA D is absolutely there and very real.  Over 30 years it comes to 3.33% per year.  That leaves you with 5.76%.Then you gotta pay your debt.  TGP spent 35m in the last quarter servicing debt as at the end of the quarter of 1.9bn.  Now you’re of course right - some of that is financing ships which are being built and don’t generate any income.  Let’s be generous and assume those are financed for free (they’re not, but bear with me).  Let’s say 20% of the interest is financing ships in construction.  What then is the interest rate on the debt?  I make it 6% - 0.8*35*4/1900.  That’s pretty close to the asset return.  So in effect the equity here gets no benefit from the leverage provided by the debt - in fact all it gets is the risk.  And interest rates are at century lows and you’ve gotta have a 30 year view on this asset.  This seems like one bum deal.But wait, it gets worse.  Those prefs collected 6m on a pref book value of 285m - or 6*4/285=8.4%.  That’s way higher than your 5.76% your asset is actually returning. This depresses your equity return for sure below 5.76%.But wait, it gets even worse!  Those equity returns after your’ve serviced your depreciation and your debt and your prefs are subject to the IDR.  And so you’ll only get some of the upside if your predictions come true.  And I’ve ignored taxes, which if a C-corp will also be very real and let’s not forget the 20% of the interest payment I ignored above.So given all of that what multiple should a rational person be interested in the equity at?  Well my simplistic model assumes 2/1 debt/equity financing ratio, which is what it was at at end of Q3 if you count the prefs as debt.  With the above figures the equity gets a 15% return at an EV/EBITDA of 5.5x and that’s before taxes.  I would day such a return is on the limit for this being a rewarding investment given the leverage, cyclical nature, management and all the other stinky bits.  At an EV/EBITDA of 5.5x and 2/1 leverage your equity needs to take a 27% hit from the current 7x multiple you quote.  That’s some way off what you’re recommending.The important point here has been mentioned higher up in the thread by @Preferred Stock Trader  - on the above economics adding more ships does nothing for the equity.  The way equity gains is if debt interest goes down, leverage goes up (without risk going up - so impossible) or revenues go up with everything else remaining the same.  Anything else is just nasty optics enticing poor retail investors who shouldn’t touch stuff they don’t understand. GTLA!",
"J, excellent piece and respect for the very public mea culpa. We have all made mistakes and anyone who is investing on fundamentals will have been early or even wrong (guys who do trend-following and charting will have other problems). If you had perfect foresight you would probably be on a yacht somewhere.The main point that needs emphasizing is that the case for owning TK & TGP has not changed. Markets overreact and that's when opportunities arise. Who knows how much of the selling was due to ETF flows or other indiscriminate selling triggered by the crash in crude. Cashflows will ramp up over the next 2-3 years and demand will continue to exceed supply in the LNG vessel space as LNG trade grows 40% or over the next five years. Most analysts value companies using DCF models, which in turn use free cashflow (not dividends/distributions) as input and from that perspective it doesn't matter if cashflow is used to pay down debt or paid out as a distribution, either way shareholder value is created.Relative to earlier assumptions TGP will delever a bit more early on and pay out higher distributions later. This makes sense given the rising cost of money and less debt will make the equity more resilient. From a TK perspective, it makes perfect economic sense for TGP to make lower distributions early on and higher distributions later - this is due to the formula embedded in the IDRs (anything above 0.65 is split 50/50 between common units and GPs, while anything below 0.4625 is split 98/2).Let's consider two scenarios to illustrate this:a) TGP pays out $0.50/quarter for the next six yearsb) TGP pays out $0.20/quarter over the next three years and $0.80/quarter for the following three yearsUndiscounted, the sum of these two flows appears to be the same - a total of $3 over six years, however TK would receive different amounts due to the varying payouts of the GPs:under scenario a) TK would receive $322m over six years ($293m from TGP units and $28 from GPs)under scenario b) TK would receive $386m over six years ($263m from TGP units and $122m from GPs)Tk would receive almost $64m (roughly 0.63/share) more under scenario B over the next six years. The IDRs provide a booster for high payouts (above $0.65/quarter) to TK and this consideration has surely played a part in their decision. Maybe management could have done a better job at setting expectations and communicating their plans, but to me this makes good economic sense. The value of IDRs will be greatest when distributions are highest and one way to achieve this, is to create a bit of headroom over the next 24 months and distribute less. Patience will be rewarded.",
"Nice piece J.  I don't recall seeing any guidance from mgmt on DCF/Shr post-2019 buildout, only the EBITDA guidance.  Do you have any estimate on this?",
"Great work J, and optimistic as always :-PWhy is everybody so sure Awilco is going to be able to secure finance and pay TGP what they owe? I think this will be TGP biggest headache in 2019.There is risk Awilco deal ends like the Skaugen deal. TGP first tried kicking the can down the road, waited too much to retake their ships and ended losing a lot of charter pay. None has been recovered.",
Straw poll:  who here would have more confidence in this name were management to turn over. I would certainly add.,
I guess we need TNK to save the day.. Maybe if Tanker rates sustain higher rates for 2 years and TNK will be $4- $6 company again.. Then maybe TK will get back to $10.. Just venting while sipping on cheap Russian Vodka..,
Wow--sjm super outstanding work IMO!,
"The current sum-of-the pieces (SOP) is a simple calculation- we know the shares owned and current prices of the sister companies, the parent level cash, debt, transaction value of Sevan and 100.4 mm TK shares outstanding. I have embedded it in a spread sheet & updated real time. The wild cards are 1) the true value of boats on the balance sheet; 2) the value of the GPs/IDRs.  At the current time the SOP of TK is $4.11 assuming the boats are at book value ($312MM) and the GP/IDRs at zero.  If J is right that the GP/IDRs are worth $600-700mm add $6-7/share to your SOP for TK.  If the future value of TGP goes to $20 or $25, then the SOP of TK would go to $5.74 or $7.00 (25.2 MM sh. owned by TK, 100.4 MM TK sh.all else unchanged).  In a bullish scenario for TK, where TGP goes to $25, the boats at the parent level are worth BV, and the GPs are worth 700MM, the SOP of TK would vault to $14, a price seen on TK just 3 years ago.  Given the speculative nature of this industry, the recent volatility of energy prices, widening of credit spreads, the inherent financial leverage within TK & its sister organizations, the wild price volatility of both TK & TGP and other shipping stocks, I'm just going to stick w/TGP until I see more concrete evidence that TK is addressing its parent-level financial leverage.",
"When folks are starting to point at PR and management of shareholders as the reason why shares underperform, Same if they have to revert to changes in tax status, buy backs, IDR restructering, and other magic party-like-it-is-2007-again tricks to magically create value out of vapors, it is mostly because they are overextended, or they know their fundamental case is flawed. Just saying. The most valuable resource in investing is a mirror.If management sucks and throws you off wrong footed repeatedly, even though you are this company friendly expert with an army of dedicated followers, if I understand the article correctly, why invest in them? Or at least discount it so you have safety of margin.To me, it's surreal. It is not the solution, it is the cause. Certainly in shipping, quality of management should be the no.1 criterium.",
"What this company needs is more confidence from management (purchases from insiders or a buyback). Mr. Kremin have it easy (or Kenneth Hvid, or...), if he buys, the stock will skyrocket (and he will earn a lot of money). Too easy. Why they don't do it?",
"There are two items everyone should focus on. Firstly, the following from this article:""So is TK ""screaming/baffling"" cheap? No. Not currently. In fact, if you think the GP/IDR is totally worthless, then you get a value in the mid-$3s. If you think the FPSOs are worth closer to $200M (Hummingbird Spirit alone is likely worth more than that, but that's a different discussion), that's another 50 cents off.""The second are these comments from the earnings call. This speaks directly to the ""hope"" that TGP will again transition back to a big distribution model resulting in significant IDR value for TK. As such, I would put the ""Bullish"" and ""Base"" scenarios directly in the trash bin where they belong.    ""The third objective is that we would like Teekay LNG to be more self-funding and reliant on the MLP markets as a primary source of the equity funding. We have not issued any common units since mid-2015, and we have no plans to issue additional units to complete our existing growth projects. We believe the MLP markets have been in its module state for the past number of years, and the ability for firms like ours to raise competitively price capital as diminished since the energy downturn in late 2015. We do not see this trend improving in the next few years. And therefore, we need to ensure we can fund the equity portion of new growth more through internally generated sources. And lastly, we are using more fundamental financial metrics like free cash flow, including debt amortization payments, when analyzing distribution levels and our own intrinsic value when evaluating divestment returns, because sometimes buying our own fleet through share repurchases is the best investment we can make.""",
look at navios today.. that is the future for the stock... imho,

"Both TK & TGP seem like great investments, but it appears the entire world is against further usage of fossil fuels and will do whatever possible to put everything related to it 'out of business'.",

Nice recapitulation .Had to see the breakdown of the equity income on Yamal. Nice.TGP guided $ 7 million net more in Q42018.For 2019 we will have an extra $ 20 million from Yamal (6 months on average) en $ 15 million interest savings..For 2020 the same.Management was very cautious in raising the distribution for next year to $ 0.19. Once Yamal is running at full speed they will raise again. I like such an approach.With a little help from the LPG division TGP will make$ 200 million net profit in 2020 and this to be repeated for the next decade at least. Then we will see other headlines on SA !,
I fully get the title though: keep them coming! ;),

JMNice analysis.  I have TK for some time. Prefer to be a long-term investor. Lower price  for TK is not bad news for me.  My question is how bad it can become if a world-wide recession happens in 2020?  Would love to see your analysis on this.,
"How about an analysis of the horrible bad reaction to the new merger and stop drop of CPLP in the same industry. I think a report is in order for those who bought at higher prices when you ""pounded the table"" for much higher prices.",
"There is an overwhelming sentiment issue overhanging many MLP shipping companies, created the the regular betrayals of the LPs to the MLP unit holders. This leads to a vicious circles where unit prices get depressed due to risk/lack of faith and thus breaks the MLP model where the LP can't milk the MLP to purchase drop down and raise funds with unit issues.TK is never going to get the TGP distribution back up to IDR fulfilling levels so the question is what move will they make and will it feel like a betrayal to TGP holders?  TGP buy out their IDRs? Sale or merger of TGP?Shipping MLPs that dramatically restore their distribution to old high levels? Almost never happens.  Shipping MLPs that do something that destroys unit holder values in situations like this, happens all the time",
"Thank you so much for the analysis, the market can stay irrational for a long time but these two companies will shine, what is your current split re TGP vs TK, you have previously leaned a little to TKThanks",
"@J Mintzmyer ,  You are bold enough to admit the timeline judgement error and appreciate your reports. But I think this is a dead horse you are trying to make it get up , let alone run. The Horse has forgotten to run and has difficulty in getting up.  And the main reason is the huge debt level and lack of cash flow to square off the debt. I think in such a high leveraged company with a very high risk business such as shipping : using EBITDA to justify is a disaster and this is the reason why market does not get attracted to this sector.  Management has been correctly advised to reduce leverage before they can return high dividends.  1.TGP is not attractive due to high risks on Yamal and market likely discounts the yamal contracts by 50%  due to russia related risks and this alone would make TGP un investible in near term.  I think they are better off to sell their stack in the Yamal  JV and clean up their act.I think if Torben was alive would have never allowed this risk.2. Without TGP real cash flow ( not projection)  TK is a dead horse. 3. TOO is no longer a GP/IDR after their sale to Brookfield.  And worthless for them other than dividends. They are better off to sell off their balance equity in TOO and reduce their leverage in TK.  I do not believe TK would get a fair dividend out of TOO as the new management priority is their overall return and not just the dividend.4. That lives only TNK and the options left for TK to deal with their TNK mess.  Unlike your analysis I do believe if there is one investment which can bail out TK it is going to be TNK. You know that the cash flows in TNK is highly dependent on the spot market rates. This tanker segment is really very volatile but seems to be well poised for a good return in 2019/2020 both due to macro factors such as 2020 bunker fuel guidelines implementation as well supply demand being heavily in favour of tankers .  This is where they need to act smart . My suggestion to TK  is to make  TNK buy back as much shares as they can at current 1 dollar plus level which is the smartest way to make money compared to investing more in shipping for them. They do have a 45 million share repurchase authorized in 2017 year end .  Additionally since they have Class B share they should dispose off nearly 90percent of their class A shares post share buy back to improve liquidity and reduce leverage in TK.Overall my judgment is TK is worth less with TGP risks due to Yamal and their best hope is to manage TNK  better to take advantage of upcoming better returns of TNK and cash them.  They should spend more time do a better prediction of Tanker segment rates and position the company in their historical area of strength.  I watched their 63 videos on Tanker segment and it clearly shows that while they are articulate on why prior quarters rates were due to ,  Their ability to predict future turn of events is as unpredictable as the overall shipping sector is. Just watch their 2016 year start video and see what actually turned out to be. I think with neither the competitive advantage nor strategy advantage I think it is time to wind down the holding company and let the two remaining siblings to find their own destiny.  In summary I would say give up on this !!",
I recently cashed out of my TGP-A profitably primarily because1) K-1 concerns.2) Management concerns.I left something on the table but will keep a smallposition of TGP-B in the hopes that they will  do what they have indicated that they will do;namely eliminate the K-1.,

"There's this nagging suspicion in the back of my mind that a TGP/DLNG merger makes sense.  DLNG has little cash, TGP has a fair amount and much more coming.

TK Group badly constrained by debt. Likewise DLNG. LNG Asian demand is there but don't both companies have to be careful? Not sure I would call that a PR mistake. TK Group effectively went under once already. They don't want a repeat. IMHO.,

Thanks for the article and responding to all the comments. Great dialogue.,
"There are a lot of pluses to look forward to.  But the market clearly wants to see some value actually returned to shareholders at a time when the TK group of companies is still focused on debt reduction.  I consider that to be the major problem holding back market valuations.It's good that TGP upped their distribution and are scrapping the K-1.  Its not so good that investors have to wait until April to see the higher payout.  TK needed to throw a bone to TK shareholders this quarter (even if only a small one), and they didn't.  TNK still has a their variable distribution policy in place, and Kevin did say in the conference call that they would look at the policy each quarter, but they did not really provide any guarantees that the good Q4 spot rates would translate into a dividend.  They needed to do that and they didn't.From a company survival perspective, the focus on debt reduction is absolutely necessary.  But that doesn't mean they have to leave shareholders almost completely out in the cold and that is essentially what they have done for two of the three tickers.-Matt",
"Agreed. Respect for the way you are handling it, and thanks for the ongoing info in this under-covered sector.",
"I think providing the financial analysis to your article would add some credibility and cut down on questions. For example, showing the summary P&L starting with TTM 3Q'18 and building up your projections based on added vessels, pricing renewal assumptions, depreciation, etc. Everyone could then see how you get to the EBITDA projections from today's numbers.  Same could be said of FCF available for distribution which would account for interest expense, depreciation assumptions as well as capex, pfd divs, debt amortizations payments, etc.  These two spreadsheets would cover a lot of ground.  Investors can then argue with your revenue or cash flow assumptions but at least see how you get to your projections.  Believing projections is tough given past performance so perhaps more clarity on how they are derived would support your emphatic position regarding the value appreciation in both entities. Using your ebitda assumptions going forward, readers could see how value is created over time in the equity as ebitda increases and debt is reduced.  To me there are too many questions circling around your assumptions.",

"J.  - thanks for the update. What do you think of TOO at current price level? It already has CFVO/EBITDA of $640MM/year, and leverage is already down to 5X, yet its market cap is at $700MM, which is 1.1X of EBITDA. That is much cheaper than TGP. The main issue problem with TOO I see is that it has to fund its shuttle tanker replacement over the next two years, while TGP is done with the capex in the near term.TGP has a market cap of 4X of its EBITDA and leveraged to 9X. Granted, these numbers will look better in two years when they have doubled their EBITDA and paid down debt.",

"Appreciate the update, J.  With regard to the value of the IDRs to TK, what do you make of GLOG cutting its IDR participation in GLOP's distributions from 48% to 23% in exchange for a one-time cash payment of 30 cents/share?",
"Great article. So grateful to have a new landing pad for comments, because the old one was getting pretty full.",
"From my vantage point you do good analysis within a very difficult industry.  The fact that you ""own up"" to the mistakes builds, not detracts, from your credibility in my oppinion. The next step is to learn from the mistakes and avoid continuously making the same ones.  With all the mistakes that I have made, I should be a lot smarter.  TK management is making the prudent move (to not move the TGP dividend too aggressively) because of a number of changes- the debacle with TOO (being forced to sell), rising interest rates, widening of credit spreads and lessened MLP environment all suggest lower debt levels is the prudent corporate decision.  Those that didn't like it moved on from the stock(s).The key as to whether TK is (currently) worth $4 or $10 is the value of the GP/IDRs, primarily of TGP.  Your work suggests the GPs/IDRs are worth $600 to $700MM  (roughly $6-7/sh. of TK).  Without this, the SOP is currently worth ~$4.1 (with the boats at BV or $312MM).  If you are right, and in that TGP will be worth $25+/share in a couple of years, why doesn't BBU or BAM  buy out TK?  Clearly they could triple their money in short order.Your thoughts appreciated.",
"TK, TGP, NMM, CPLP, DLNG- the issue on these shares is not how for investors to profit, but how to stem the losses (DLNG down yet another 5% today so far). Sell now and realise losses of up to 50% on some shares, or wait and see how what are obviously very poor management teams operate in a deep recession? Many retail investors will no doubt double down, bringing their exposure way over acceptable levels on what are very speculative shares. While this might work out OK, it might also prove to be a terrible decision. No longer a question of how you will gain, but how much are you prepared to lose?",

It looks like 4 vessels come off contract next year.seekingalpha.com/...,
"J:Appreciate the update, the overview, and the mea culpa.  I have certainly been there myself, with the highs and the lows, so do not get discouraged, as I know you are not right now.For these two, TK & TGP, I have been following from the sidelines, with interest as a value investor, however, I have two issues right now.1.  Specific to valuations, particularly for TGP, I think the 10 EV/EBITDA is very expensive in today's market, so maybe the comparable firms referenced are overvalued and not the other way around?2.  Building on the above narrative, there are other, higher quality firms, like RRC for example (all assets domiciled in the heart of the United States) that trade at better than 25% free cash flow on 2020 estimates (and this was before the current rise in natural gas prices).  Point being, as cheap as TGP and TK can look, I think there are cheaper, higher quality companies out there right now, which is a function of the current market environment, and current market structure that we are in at the moment IMO.In summary, shipping is definitely an unloved area offering opportunity, and MLP's too, however, I am not sure valuations are as cheap as they look, especially compared to other downtrodden economically sensitive companies, and it appears the market is focusing more on overall debt, which could be a negative if that focus continues.  Having said that, I think there is a investment case here, though, the markets can certainly go to extremes.Thinking out loud, and wishing you the best of luck,Travis",
Going to da moon!!! Multi-Bagger!!!! Just like CPLP?,
"Can you imagine what a train wreck this Q would have been without the sudden massive spike in spot rates?  That was manna from Heaven.   Just 2 quarters before any vessel that came off contract was a crisis.  You lost money in the spot market. Going forward I worry that spot will collapse again.  It wont take but a handful of vessels coming off contract to change spot prices.Speaking of coming off contract how many and when is my question to TGP management.  What contracts are expiring in 2019 ?Lastly regarding dividend growth.  What makes you think TGP  Management cares at all about shareholders.  They clearly run their business for their best interests not ours.  So pencil in every time they discover excess free cash flow they will raise our div.  by a measly 1 cent a year and pay down debt or buy another vessel, because in the shipping business there is nothing sexier to the CEO than more ships.  Lets bottom line this.  TGP is a growth story with no growth.  All these vessels have been delivered and are under contract.  Where does that show up the bottom line?  3/4th through this expansion program and we have zip and pip to show for it.It looks like 4 vessels come off contract next year.seekingalpha.com/...",

"JM, can you please tell me where I can look up insider transactions for TGP? Thank you.",
What dividend yield will get TGP to $25?  I think it will have to be substantially higher and that many investors will not respond to share buybacks by buying more.  Sometimes investors unload during share buybacks. GLOG really knows what they're doing when it comes to boosting share price and I think their .40 special dividend was helpful.,
"To me it feels like1 they are becoming a self-funding company and forgetting the MLP-concept of distributing all excess cash (DCF)2 dividend is scaled down to generate funds to reduce debt and later, maybe, funds for expansion, while raising the dividend moderately to give the impression that TGP is a dividend growth company.That does not help TK in the form of large dividends for pressing needs.NAV of TGP goes up nicely.Perhaps TK plans to sell its interest in TGP and pay off the debt. Assuming the 3.q DCF was 50 c/sh, they established a payout ratio of 40 % (not saying so though). When the quarterly DCF reaches 70 c/sh (level reported a couple of years ago), the dividend would then be 28 c. With $1 of  DCF, dividend reaches 40 c. That would be 10 + % on the price  of recent buyers. They just forget the folks whose purchase price was $40 at the top. That is my scenario. There must be some sense in their decisions and communications. I assume bankers have been advising them.",
"Your recent track record speaks for itself, thanks but no thanks on this one",
"You ignore depreciation and earnings in your calculations.  GLOP is way better than TGP in earnings.  As I understand it, TGP will have a whopping debt that is 9 times EBITDA when finished with their new build purchases, yet you say they have a lot of liquidity.  Any company can issue preferred stock and get cash on the balance sheet, like TNP does, but the balance is poor.  IMO, your lack of focus on earnings and using EBITDA, which ignores the fact that these ships due actually depreciate, is leading you down the wrong path.",
"instead of blaming the company for being prudent, why don't you just admit your analysis has been flawed from day 1 for failing to appreciate the leverage at TGP and for some reason thinking they could be paying out well over 200 million In dividends while burning cash with a super highly levered balance sheet.  The IDR is worth about 0 although at this point TGP should be a decent investment.",
"Surprised you think that the TGP quarter was a good one.  Their operating cash flow was a disaster at negative $70 million which somehow translated to DCF of a positive $40 million.  On the face of it the DCF is complete fiction.  Maybe things will improve in Q4, but with total operating cash flow of a puny $11 million for the first 9 months the market has lost faith in any cash flow projections for TGP.",
"Although management here appears to be tone deaf, I appreciate your candid comments concerning these recent events. I have followed your coverage of TGP and SSW for some time, and I enjoy your insights into the  informational dark hole of shipping stocks. I have not formally subscribed to your service only because I will never be able to risk more than 5% in this sector.

Personally I hold both stocks but for now am not growing my investment in either except dividend re-investment in WMT..Social security isn't all about break even. Consider what you can do in your mid 60's vs. your mid 80's. having the discretionary income earlier provides you many additional options. However if Social security is your main source of retirement income, if possible my suggestion is to wait until at least FRA and if you can keep working until 70's",
"I would guess that most decisions about taking social security prior to ""full retirement age"" are driven by ""need"", as in ""I need the money now"" and that trumps any argument about taking it later.  Only if you don't need the money now will you consider the benefits of waiting past 62 to take payments.  Actuarial neutrality means on a system wide basis when someone begins withdrawals doesn't matter since the average total withdrawals are the same, but on a personal level, you only get one roll of the dice, and again it comes down to ""do you need the money?"".If you don't need it now, don't need it until you are 70, but will need it after you reach 70, the decision to wait until 70 is easy and provides a risk free way to have more monthly income after that.The interesting questions arise when you don't need the money but wouldn't mind having it:  Often the question is framed as ""would you rather have some money now or more money later"" and since you can't get a lump sum, it comes down to deciding how long you will live.  I calculated that my personal ""breakeven point"" came at age 82:  basically if I wait until 70 to withdraw money and live past 82 my ""total lifetime"" withdrawals are higher.  But, it's not that simple, because if you don't need the money yet take it early, you have up to 8 years (depending on the age you take it) of social security income which you can invest and that may more than make up for the ""lost"" income and in effect push the ""breakeven"" period further into the future.  The decision is impossible to make with any precision because one key factor (when you die) is excluded from your calculation (though not from the systems' calculation).  In a way it comes down to guessing your life span...",

"Good informative article, thank you.  However, I disagree with your choice of which stock will rise in the future.  Walmart is a more stable company that tends to stay in a short price range and I do not see it moving much higher.  Amazon is constantly growing, offers new areas for their growth and since I prefer a growth stock over what I consider a value stock (Wmt) I will continue to add Amazon to my portfollio.  It may be at a higher risk but I want a higher return for my retiement.  I have owned it on and off since the IPO and its high PE has never bothered me.  It is what I consider normal for Amazon as strange as that may sound.  It is totally beated down along with the other Fang stocks but, I feel it should not have been included.  Its fundamentals have only improved, has no claims of its selling data (FB/GOOG), is not a one trick pony (AAPL) and like NFLX grows subscribers.  Therefore it is a winner andI expect it will resume getting back to its $2000+ price level after all the noise about Trade settles.Just my opinion.","Retirement Strategies: Amazon And Walmart Head To Head, And A Discussion On Retirement Timing"

"Here at the ASH meeting, it refers to the emerging tussle between two different methods of recruiting immune cells to kill cancer cells. BiTE is short for bispecific T cell engager. BiTEs are antibodies with two arms. One arm of the drug attaches to a specific protein on the tumor cell. The other arm of the BiTE activates immune cells in the patient to kill the cancer cells. Like other antibody drugs, BiTEs have the advantage of being off the shelf, meaning the same product can be given to all patients. That’s more convenient (and potentially less expensive) than CAR-Ts, which are bespoke therapies made from cells taken from each patient. But CAR-Ts are infused into patients once, while BITEs, at least the first generation, require patients to be hooked up to a portable infusion pump that infuses the drug continuously during weeks of treatment.On Saturday, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals presented some early, proof-of-concept data on a bispecific antibody called REGN1979 that binds the CD3 molecule on a patient’s T cells to a protein called CD20 found on the surface of two common types of lymphoma cells. A potentially registration-worthy clinical trial is planned next year, Regeneron said.",

"Great article! However, I find your estimate for peak sales of $10B/year is too conservative. My estimate that $10B sales only equates to about 5M prescriptions a month. I think the potential market for Vascepa is bigger than Lipitor alone which had peak sales of >$10B several years back when drug pricing were much lower. I could see that more patients will be more likely to take Vascepa knowing the safety, benefits and awareness of Omega 3s/Fish oils.",
"Decent article from a 1st time author - but a minor quibble with ""AMRN won't raise the price"" - they've already raised it 5% for 2019 based on my Part D copay shown on Medicare.gov - they've raised it around that amount every year since I've been on it (2013). BP might try to double the price if they BO AMRN, but PBM's will demand much larger discounts if they do, and I'd expect a big outcry of price gouging to take place as well, assuming the # of patients taking it at that time is sufficiently large.One thing that might help boost scrips higher in 2020, if not sometime in 2019, is that generic Lovaza has been dropped to T4 for Medicare Part D plans for next year - used to be on T1 - may be dropped altogether since most sales are off label for CVD prevention, and there's no evidence Lovaza has any efficacy for that use, but there's great data showing V does. AMRN really needs to push this out to doctors to get patients switched over faster.",

But likely the revenue will be a lot higher next year than that. There are less than 200k patients using vascepa now, which is not surprising, considering most doctors have never heard about vascepa. Now the situation is different and everyday more and more doctors get aware of vascepa, at an dramatically increasing rate. Even if the drug doesnt get the desired label in a year or so, which the contributors have pointed out, there is very likely going to be a boost in the sales already next year. What if the sales are 1b already next year. Not unrealistic at all. Many times stocks like amarin can go down for no reason even if they are already cheap. Anyway, I am accumulating more at these IMO very low levels.",

"Chris, a little better research is necessary. Couple of quick but important items that you missed: as noted in a comment above, Amarin won a landmark case against the FDA few years back allowing it to market Vascepa for off-label indications. (The problem with off label Rx is that it’s harder to get approval from insurers, although it’s getting done). Also, the articles by both Forbes and AF were not quickly written. They had prior access to the results from the AHA but were embargoed from revealing the results or releasing any articles until after Amarin’s presentation. Were they hit pieces? Agree maybe Forbes/Herper was biased since he seemed to seek out naysayers and relied heavily on a doc who is leading competitive trial for Major BP (AZN I believe) and should have been disqualified from commenting due to such a huge conflict. Poor judgement by Herper (if not intentional).",
"As a 30 year rep in Pharma,be asssured that the 400 reps with Amarin cannot possibly attain reach and frequency on prescribers necessary to affect sufficient sales of a pharmaceutical product even with the robust data achieved in the Reduce-It study. Doctors are busy people and it has been demonstrated that it takes a certain number of contacts to alter prescribing habits,much less change of  a paradym.Amarin will need to merge, be bought out or partner with a large company with lots of reps to allow Vascepa to maximise potential sales.I would say it is incumbent upon Amarin to do one of the courses of action for the benefit of patients.",

No smallcap bio should be a victim no more hereafter. One thing you forgot to discuss is Anchor control that asks to produce evidence. All JT has to do is reveal whether they submitted response to Anchor control with efficacy evidence and boom the market will restore the true value of Vascepa in a second, imo. FDA has 60 days timeline to review and respond and had JT submitted the evidence by Sep 24th, we are well into the 60 days period now and we can get Anchor anyday now. All the fake news will die out completely because Anchor label by FDA will put everything to rest permanently.",

“Amarin is not currently permitted to promote off-label uses of Vascepa due to FDA regulations” ?,
Very nice article!,
Sooner or later AMRN will be bought by Big Pharma or Big Bio.  Even Adam Feuestein stated that AMRN should be acquired.(He even names AMGN as a potential buyer.)  My logic is itmakes zero sense for AMRN to sell Vascepa with its very smallsales force of several hundred reps.  Big Pharma has manythousands of sales reps...this should be on the radar of BP.There are also many additional indications that Vascepa maybe good for...BP could run several trials at the same time inorder to get those additional indications.  Vascepa itselfshould be taken many at risk around age 50.,
"This is already an approved drug. We are waiting to see if the FDA expands the label. Other articles have noted that even without the FDA expanding the label there will be a very large increase in prescriptions due to off label use. Knowing how the market over reacts to news you might be right about the 60 to 70 percent drop but I think it would be very short term. I bet prescriptions are already exploding and will continue to increase. It will take longer but the share price would recover in less than a year. On a personal note I am going to see if my doctor will write me a prescription. Why not? I see almost zero downside and a very high upside with an almost guaranteed drop in triglycerides.Nice article, I just wanted to point out that the downside should be limited with a nice recovery when the sales jump up.",

"The over reaction was I believe due to people thinking the raise means no BO.  Of course for all we know, any purchaser could want the extra cash as part of the deal, but who knows.  I think AMRN is way too small to take advantage of this enormous opportunity and will accept any reasonable offer and let one of the big boys finish the job.  A partnership in Europe would be a nice catalyst as we wait, along with a big increase in prescriptions.",
Nice article. Well articulated and documented. Thanks for posting it. P.S. I always enjoy reading your stuff. Please post more on AMRN.,
"In my view no one will know how many shares were sold and at what price until next 10q when share count should show up. It could be A 10% discount to yesterdays closing price or 18 for all we know.   But the problem is now AMRN will raise money  with the ATM offering machine that hides transparency.  Many were upset an offering took place after CEO was vague about a cash grab.   This type of ATM offering is the same game going forward and remains an overhang that was unnecessary by just grabbing the cash they needed,    I see more downside in short term,  they need to make huge script numbers or all that cash will be gone in 12 months and the ATM machine will be diluting on regular basis in my view.",
"I believe the excessive selling was most likely  Mr Market's reaction to  CEO, John Thero's signalling that he is serious about GIA .  Thero has no intent on selling this valuable asset, as the optics of his recent  selling $11.6 M of stock at $19.7, followed by this recent financing seem to indicate.

This equals 15900/500=31.8 USD/Share, resulting in a share price of 188.5-31.8=156.7 USD/share.Also, the share repurchase will reduce cash or enlarge debt; acquisitions (2 of them in your base case with 2 acquisitions) will reduce cash or enlarge debt (or enlarge share count if financed by new shares). Both will have a negative impact on the calculated share price (repurchase of 43bUSD equals - 86 USD/Share; acquisition of 25bUSD equals -50 USD/Share).I would appreciate if you could clarfy on that issue and give some more explanation and insight from your point of view.",

"For the contrarians out here, the following is from SL Advisors and talks about  some of the MLP  history that has led to the poor sentiment, but good values...""-The Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) recently cut its distribution again, resulting in a 34% cumulative reduction since 2014. Not only did some MLPs with high yields cut their dividends outright to fund growth projects and reduce leverage, but many were purchased by their much lower yielding parent companies, providing “backdoor” distribution cuts to MLP. -The consequent betrayal of income-seeking investors has had many casualties, including still-depressed sentiment oblivious to attractive valuations.-Another change has been the breakdown of the seasonal pattern. Having been mistreated, income-seeking investors no longer act so predictably. Over the past five years the January effect has completely gone. So has the quarterly pattern – years ago, when the sector was stable and fairly unexciting, holding your investment a few more weeks so as to get that extra distribution wasn’t inordinately risky. -MLP investors have learned to appreciate risk differently, and it’s clear that the calendar bears very little on the timing of today’s buyers and sellers. What’s striking about the past five years is both the randomness of the monthly returns, as well as that the average month is -0.3%. From 1996-2013 it was +1%.-The loss of the seasonal pattern is further evidence that the traditional investor, with her predictable habits developed over years of happy results, has left. It’s why the sector is cheap, because the former buyers have fallen out of love. Thus spurned, large MLPs have converted to corporations in search of new suitors, such that less than half of U.S. midstream infrastructure now retains the MLP format. Many believe the MLP model is irretrievably broken.Eventually, and possibly quite soon, rising dividends will draw in a new set of buyers. They’ll buy corporations that were formerly MLPs, as well as some of the remaining MLPs. They’ll rely on discounted cash flow analysis (see Valuing MLPs Privately — Enterprise Products Partners). They’ll look beyond the betrayals (see Kinder Morgan: Still Paying for Broken Promises). They’ll find a sector with 11% free cash flow yields before financing new projects, and dividend yields of 6%+ growing at 10% (our 2019 forecast for the American Energy Independence Index).""sl-advisors.com/...Disclosures:   1) SL Advisors are a SA contributor, and I am a follower.

We could see mid-30s if the quarter isn't stellar, so you first time buyers get ready for a great entry point under 40, or add more if you already hold it like myself.

No more overnight packets or couriers, no more lost paper documents and the acceptance by first time customers regardless of age is universal. They were smart to use email as a delivery vehicle rather than exclusively promoting an ap or website portal. Another benefit is sales, production, accounting and management all are updated real time as to the status of the contract. Try that with paper contracts!We will never go back to paper and it is doubtful we would switch in the future to another entity entering the space with better price or features, since everything is working fine.

"Silly GM workers believed the trickle down lie, that the economy was booming, and that there are more jobs than workers.I guess that's why GM is kicking nearly 15,000 of them to the curb after receiving massive tax cuts and are spending that money on restructuring and buybacks, not expansion, more jobs, or pay increases as they so foolishly believed along with every other worker who has suffered from job loss and pay cuts since the tax cut boon for the wealthiest while shitting on the average household.I'll never buy another GM product again and I've owned 10 of them but no more, especially after that slimey Barra waited until AFTER Thanksgiving to announce the end of those workers careers/livelihoods and pensions.I hope GM goes bankrupt and for good this time.What they did is the definition of lousy and unfortunately they are not alone as this is happening all across the country in several sectors.There have been more job losses, more importantly, middle class living wage job losses, than jobs ""created"" since the bullshit tax cuts which are funding the restructuring and automation that is driving the bloodbath of middle class job losses that actually support families and growth.Get ready for a hell of a lot lower for longer, if not forever as the US transitions into a 2 class, subscription/renter based society where ownership is fast becoming a thing of the past just like the middle class.",

"Unfortunately forward guidance is all that matters in this very tricky and unforgiving market.  So even though I appreciate what this author did, I don't think it is true that beating estimates for Q1 will have any meaningful impact.  The truth is that MU could report EPS of $4.00 for Q1 but if they are even a tiny bit nervous about the future the stock will tank.  Another very important point about the buyback is that it is irrelevant to Bears, because Bears believe that free cash flow will take a nose dive and MU will not be making any money in the near future because of the memory pricing collapse.  In this sense, the Bears have found a way to just take the buy back out of the equation altogether.  The Bears are in control right now with this stock.  The sentiment is awful.  The articles I read every day talk about memory being a cheap commodity product that is all going to be made in China in a few years.  The articles talk about DRAM pricing collapse. The articles talk about MU management being clueless and increasing CAPEX despite impending doom.  Of course, this is the exact opposite of the storyline in Spring 2018, but it is hard to change a narrative once it is has taken hold.",
Thanks Bold for a great article.  I do think the explosion in share count over the past 3 years has hurt the stock from staying above 60.  Based on their buyback announcement of about 50% of FCF to buybacks - Average FCF annually for next couple of years is about 8-9 bill  - say they use 4 bill annually - that is 1 bill  per quarter  - about 20-25 million shares at the 40-50 price - so share count should come down 100 million shares per year or 200 mill over next two years to under 1 bill.  Plus they probably did some extra buybacks - so say another 2 bill or 50 million shares and we get to about 950 o/s in two years.  250 mill shares retired - about 20% of share count should add about $2 share to remaining shares keeping trough earnings around $7-8 while producing great free cash flow.  The most amazing thing is that I've read two Street analyst and they all have share count around  1.1-1.2 bill in 2020 - like the buyback won't happen.  I really think that is the only big catalyst for Dec ER is if they show a big big buyback and committment to get the share count down under 1 bill asap.,

"My understanding of how the earnings per share number is calculated is that it is a weighted average of what and when the shares are increased are decreased during the period for which it is being computed. Therefore, if purchases are made during the final weeks or days of a quarter or fiscal year this will not have the same positive impact as if the buying had occurred much earlier in the respective period. In other words it is too simplistic to assume the calculation of EPS will use the actual number of shares outstanding at the end of MU’s first quarter. While you are likely correct that the share repurchase is probably greater than expected, because they occurred late in the first quarter the impact should be significantly less than the 4 to 5 percentage point decline in shares outstanding than you calculated.",
We have have two more quarters of trough earnings and perhaps drop EPS to 2.5 then start rebounding,
"The Author has done a wonderful job of looking at MU Managements’ Reduction of Share count thru their Buyback efforts. Also the Author’s projection on Buyback Affect on Earnings is very worthy of consideration by all Posters, Investors, and Shareholders. I had wondered when an SA Author would take a hard look at MU Buyback and project an Earnings Report Number based udon the reduction. I think any Earnings Reported over the $3.00 number will be a Superior Earnings Report and be cause for celebration. However, Forward Guidance (Company Estimates) will be crucial as usual. No one knows for sure how MU Forward Guidance will be received, but by May/June 2019, folks will be looking back and saying what a great buying opportunity MU “was” in the winter of 2018.Wishing Well To The Author And MU Shareholders!",

I think the market sell of mu is not because of esp; but the growth rate of dram and nand plus the China / US trade war plus Ip focus .

I never would have thought it could turn out as badly as it has.As I've said previously in these threads, partnering with or buying SGYP seems like a good option for BHC to me. It looks like it would fit nicely within their GI business and a new source of growth. But Joe Papa & co are much better qualified to assess this than you or I are (no kidding), so we should just trust their judgment with whatever they decide about this. (Not that they would be paying attention to random people on the internet anyway.) Perhaps they decided to just wait and pick up Trulance at a knockdown price in bankruptcy, like what Mike Pearson did with Dendreon.Regarding BHC capitalizing on its opportunities in GI, an important part not mentioned in your article is that Xifaxan is a major pipeline as well as existing drug (like AGN's Botox). It can be used to treat other GI diseases, in particular Crohn's disease, which is a lucrative drug market from what I've heard. In fact the best review I've seen for Xifaxan on the internet was for an off-label use for Crohns disease... Papa & co should get a move on with trials and getting FDA approval for this and other new indications for Xifaxan - I'm a bit annoyed with how slow it seems to have been going so far.",Bausch Health Is Failing To Capitalize On Its IBS Leadership

So CYBR high customer acquisition investment is an excellent strategy at this stage in market cycle.The other thing I like is it is brain and code - no stock inventory, no chip cycles etc. Revenues are stabilised through forward contracts, and a very good cash pile so protected if/when money gets more expensive. I noticed through October, CYBR and others were a bit less volatile - not immune, just less scary.I get more fireworks from other sectors (I hold AMD, 'nuff said) but the sane bit of me likes this sector, it reminds me that patience can be a good thing.","Facebook Needs A Cybersecurity Clean-Up, CyberArk Is The Company For The Job"

"Bravo, Dividend Power!  This article is the best of any on General Mills that I have read in years, and there have been many.  I have two criticisms though.  The first is that you can't value a business based on the distributions that a management chooses to pay out to shareholders.  I don't understand why that is a hard concept to understand.  While a company may be able to pay a dividend over time, every penny paid out reduces the value of the business.  Some argue that paying a dividend forces management to not waste money on foolish things such as overpriced acquisitions.  Well, that doesn't seem to be true in all cases.  Just look what General Mills management has done over the past three or more years, even though they were paying relatively large amounts in dividends to its shareholders.    They have bought shares of General Mills and Blue Buffalo at greatly inflated prices with company money.  Many of those GIS shares they then rewarded themselves with through their compensation packages.When a business spends corporate money, it makes sense that the business gain value as the result of that spending.  That they get back more value than they pay out.  What value does a business get back when it pays taxes.....little if any.  What value does it get back when it spends money on advertising...hopefully more in profitable sales.  What value does it get back when it pays a dividend.....none that I can determine  On that basis paying a dividend can often reduce the value of a business just like paying taxes.  Do we value a business based on how much they pay in taxes?   Why would we value it based on how much they pay out in dividends?  That sure doesn't make sense to me.The second criticism that I have for the article is that management decisions have not been analysed in any depth.  What about use of capital over the past 3-5 years.  Rather than valuing the shares based on P/E or the dividend yield, doesn't it make sense to use the cost of the issuance of the new equity.  The author points out that they sold about $1 billion in new shares to the public and was able to place those shares at $44 apiece.  After selling costs, the company received about $42.50 a share.  I suggest that $42.50-$44 is a very good starting point for valuing this business, so it may be reasonable to believe that is this General Mills value,  Those prices frame my current estimate of value almost exactly.  I certainly don't believe that the market got a great bargain at their purchase price of the new shares, since they paid $1.50 more than GIS was willing to receive.i guess I have a third point of difference with the author.  He seems to be okay with the current management.  I'm not, I don't think it is likely that there will be a management change in the near future so I need a large margin of safety to buy this company's shares. I could be too generous in valuing the shares and so can investors, too hungry for its 4.5% distributions.I will consider buying these shares only at prices lower than $38.  But even that 10% discount to the business value may not be sufficient to prove safe and or profitable with the current management in place.",

A 4.5% dividend alone is not a reason to buy stock in a company.  One needs to look toward the future growth of the company.  I do not see much growth here.

Carvana had considerably cheaper cars ($1,500-$2,000) than CarMax which was the reason I switched other than more convenience. Also just bought a newer version of the same car which helped make it easier to pull the trigger. Carvana would probably be well served to have a small show room so that you can test drive models.

"""Ask me how I know""Held for 20 years? Seems unlikely and here's why.From AMZN 's peak in 1999 to its bottom in 2001, AMZN dropped from about $102/sh to below $7/sh. At the bottom, an investor would have suffered about a 93% setback from its peak. AMZN did not touch $102/sh again until some 10 years later...a decade of dead money.What type of experienced investor sat there day in day out looking at his multi bagger stock  gains going down the drain saying...""It is reasonable that this 5 yr old public company will come back to its old highs. It is reasonable that after dropping some 93% it will now go up 186% just to get me back to pre-crash highs.""Furthermore, what wise investor said ""I'm going to wait 10 years if I must just so I can get back to pre-crash highs of $102/sh because the online book business is going to be HUGE!""  Remember, there was no AWS or Third Party Selling or Ad Search revenues even on the horizon. Hence, there was no allure to even hang on to AMZN at this point in time.It is true that one would have ultimately made spectacular gains if one had held 20 years. However, this is not the point. Hindsight is 20/20. The point here is who would have had the temerity AT THE TIME in the year 2000 to suffer such losses when there was no clear line of sight of AMZN's future.This was the era of the dot com bubble. And once the market began to crash in late 1999 panic & fear took hold. Irrational behavior became the norm even for the most informed investor. Capital accumulation took a back seat to capital preservation as rattled retail investors en masse headed for the exits.The switch went from ""risk on"" to ""risk off"". If your company wasn't making a profit...it got sold. This was a very scary environment for all investors but especially for investors in a dot com company. So the thought that a small retail investor would have hung on during the crash and then held for an additional 10 years just to get back to pre-crash highs, despite all odds seeming to be against it, stretches perhaps the bounds of credulity.",

Gains on debt extinguishment constitute $64 mm through 9/30, without which LGCY's net loss would have been roughly ($100) mm rather than ""only"" ($34) mm.  The bonds repurchased cannot be voted by LGCY to change any of the economic terms, only ""strip"" them of protective covenants.",
"Also the 20 or the 21 will be treated equally should a restructuring occurs.  They is no reason for the 20's to trade at 72, and the 2021's at 55. These things are highly illiquid I' m not sure they indicate anything. One thing is sure though, Legacy will impose terms on everyone else except the GSO which might force them to restructure. Interestingly, since the company owns the debt, shareholders do too, which creates a very strange situation should the equity be wiped out...Shareholders voting themselves out of existence would be an interesting scenario.",
Maybe things have changed  but last I checked  legacy the company owns the majority of the debt . They bought the bonds back but they never took them off the books. The company's owns in fact more then 50% of the outstanding debt and is in the position to impose its vote on everyone else when a restructuring happens in or out of courts. As for the 55 cents print on the last trade it is a bit suspicious. Dropping from 78 to 55 in one trade would suggest either the trade is bogus or something material happened and no one knows about it except for whomever sold these bonds.,
Bonds are pricing in a 65% chance of bankruptcy.  That's why the stock is about to hit a 1 handle.  For all the blah blah about Baines they are now completely underwater on the position; a huge potential loss.  Grim!,

"I think this is one of the most comprehensive publications on the macro view i've seen.  Its a little dated (May 2018) but I believe most of this still holds true.  Trump tweets and short term headlines shouldn't really be our concern.... Its more important to think 6-24 months out.  I suspect many of you may have seen this, but if not, its a worthwhile read for anyone doing any real research and analysis in this space.  victormorales.net/...The gist is that in the medium to long term, we are in the early stages of the next oil cycle and supply (including heavy shale depletion) and demand fundamentals point to higher prices rather than lower.  Of course a recession could put a damper on things, but not necessarily.  .... in the short term, anything can happen.",
"For those that follow the impact of geopolitics on crude oil prices. I would like to hear your views.1. Bear market media keep talking about MBS/KSA not going through with the Cut in production in fear of white house/Trump 2. Bear market media giving reasons of why MBS ll not cut oil fearing breaking ties with the US.My questions:1.  Ll US risk losing MBS/KSA to Putin/Russia. For those that follow politics, Putin is a much smarter politician than Trump and he has been building a relationship with KSA because it means billions of dollars in Weapon sale (proven effective in Syria). 2. What ll MbS decide If Trump pushes more and puts him in a bad spot risking the collapse of KSA economy if oil drop further or stays long at $50. Is Trump or the senate with their vote today willing to face the consequence of KSA allying and buying weapons from Russia because USA has become a bully at the expense of the kingdom’s wealth?!3. Is Trump (good businessman) not seeing that the more money KSA has the more weapons it ll buy from USA. 4. Is Trump not also privilege to reports that indicate oil below $55-60 is bad for US economy?! Oil at $70 earlier this year was hand in hand with excellent economy.5. Doesn’t Trump see that trade war with China is costing US and China billions of revenue loss and both are very close to making a deal to end this war that is not good for both?!All these questions have logical answers and all point to a boost in oil prices.

"This company, and many other NA upstream E & P's are in big trouble if we have another year or two of 2015-2016 oil prices.I don't see how LGCY survives this.  Same goes for many others, including some thought to be leaders in the space.One thing to keep in mind, in addition to falling share prices, 2015-16 oil prices will cause serious issues in the high yield market.  Goldman Sachs is concerned about this.",
Why is the stock continuing to drop like a rock despite uptick in oil price?  All of my other oil stocks are green today!,
Not worth showing a scenario where seasonal spike in Nat gas to $4.58 lasts forever.  Market will never assign that type of pricing when strip can be bought so much lower.,
I agree with JSG_DRIP. The only play in LGCY is the Bonds. Bondholders receive 8% Dividends on a six month basis.LGCY stock holders have been receiving bad news. Tyingup your money in LGCY stock is a bad investment IMHO when you can purchase the 8% Bonds.,
DJ thinks oil prices are going higher with every fiber of his being.  Oil is def going into the 40s.  The only way to play LGCY is the bonds.  DJ refuses to acknowledge the bonds,
"Despite reassurances to the contrary, I don't believe investors are taking LGCY hedges for both oil and gas into account when valuing the company. That includes existing hedges, plus new hedges that are likely to be needed soon to comply with loan covenants. Any additional hedging put in place in the near term is likely to be at current depressed prices.",
Tax loss selling will take this down to maybe $2. If oil is in a year long bear market this company may not survive. If you want to speculate buy the healthiest companies.,
"Thanks Daniel for the LGCY article and for sharing your LGCY calculations.  As the un-named critic that suggested a 6X EBIDTA multiple, thanks for taking my advice and showing that.I hate to nit pick, but your assumptions for future natural gas prices are off. Take a look at the natural gas futures prices in barchart.com.  December 2019 natural gas is under $3 and December 2020 is even lower.  The futures market may be wrong, but it's the best estimate we have.  I'm actually bullish on LGCY, but just trying to keep the calculations real here.Disc: I cover the LGCY unsecured bonds as watch list issues at the Panick High Yield Report.",
"Daniel:  You've been calling this stock ""...too cheap"" since it was $10, $9, $8, $5, $3.50 and now $2.40.    You make new assumptions in your ""model""....outline various scenarios and spit out a buy recommendation, despite massively varying OBSERVED valuations.  You should have sold around $7 when you had a nice homerun with your $2.30 weighted cost price.    Here is the reality of LGCY:  Overlevered E&P firm with some good properties that was on it's way to rising from the dead with the rally in oil thru 2018.  However, with oil crashing, the uncertainty associated with reducing it's debt burden has reduced the stock back down to an option value on the enterprise.  Any debt restructuring will dilute existing shareholders period.  So unless, crude rallies back to $65 - $70, the stock is dead money here until a resolution of the debt issue.  Applying grossly optimistic EBITDA estimates ( no way 2018 ends over $300mm EBITDA, even with current hedges and why bother with forecasting 2022 EBITDA?? You have no idea, the company doesn't have any idea??) to various multiples is a useless exercise.  Chevron, a useful exercise, overlevered special sits....waste of time.",

"by the way, great article. disagree with the conclusion but i learn some things i need to check in my note the ""operating cash flow"". if morninstar ok, we have since 2013 to 2017: 64.37	78.29	44.46	58.50	20.10m$adjusted ebitda from 100m$ 90m$ 70m$ 48m$ 35m$ (31m$ 9M 2018)little capital commitment after 2019so if the cycle reverse to 2014 peak, era could hit 80m$ in cashflow (in 2024 in your macro economics graph)not bad for a company at 230m$ market cap",
"David,No need to apologize and thank you for taking my comments in such a constructive manner.  It’s remarkable that I am having this dialogue with an analyst in Prague.  I would like to address each of the points your reply raised.LitigationYou are correct to back out the litigation settlement, but you also need to add the non- routine professional service fees.  While the initial complaint was filed in November of 2016, Era has only disclosed what they spent for over the prior four quarters leading up to the settlement.  Adding the $15mm to operating cash flow for the associated quarters materially improves the reported numbers. Tax disputesThe Brazilian tax disputes are common occurrence for that part of the world.  I don’t recall if they have posted reserves against or even if they lose it would not be material, but I suggest you call the company and they can walk you through the issues.  I don’t know the specifics about the 2015 IRS audit but since it wasn’t a profitable year, I am not too worried.  (As an aside I would point out that most tax disputes arise from trying to shift profitability to low tax jurisdictions.  For instance, CAT is currently being investigated for generating so much of their income in a Swiss sub.)ControlsI would again suggest you speak to the company before drawing conclusions.  I attribute to growing pains associated with transitioning from a division of a public company.   As I understand it, the failures did not change the reported numbers and the remedial fixes have been implemented.  As soon as the next audit is completed, they will be allowed to remove the language from their filings.CycleThere is no perfect answer to when to buy cyclicals.  It may seem counter intuitive, but I prefer to buy cyclicals when they are losing money and hopefully, I remember to sell them when they look cheap on a PE basis.  There will be a point in the cycle when Era net income will exceed their cost of capital.  Where will the Era trade if they are achieving a $2.50 EPS run rate?  I have no idea when it will happen, but it always does.  In the interim I take comfort in knowing that my money is invested in the strongest balance sheet and lowest cost operator. You should also recognize that the recovery in offshore drilling has been slowed by the success US frac production.  It’s easier and cheaper to produce oil via fracking but the decline rate and life of the wells is extremely short when compared to offshore reservoirs.  Basically, it costs a lot more to produce offshore, but since production lasts so long it’s worth it.  Now that E&Ps have committed to spending offshore it’s difficult, but not impossible, to turn off.Dilution from stock optionsMuch of the dilution will occur only if the shares increase in price.  Also, senior management took voluntary pay cuts during the down cycle.  Again, check with the company and I think you will find, Era board worked with compensation consultants to devise the plan.  While the stock has gone nowhere for a long while, management has done an extraordinary job protecting shareholder value.  While most of the industry was issuing equity and restructuring debt, Era was improving their credit profile while keeping book value per share essentially flat.D&A PolicyThe D&A policy reflects the inherent conservatism of Charles Fabrikant.  As an analyst, I am much more concerned when D&A fails to cover the true economics of a business.  The most important thing is to understand how it impacts the income statement and balance sheet.  The quality of reported earnings is better than their peers and the fidelity of owner’s equity is improved.ConclusionWhen I can find a stock with quality management, assets and balance sheet trading 50% of book I get excited.  Having just weathered the worst downturn in the industry’s history it’s I think the probability that next four years are better than the last four is high.  If the industry doesn’t improve then the consolidation opportunities will only expand.  SEACOR has been public since 1992.  Since then, SEACOR has demonstrated their opportunistic discipline on the M&A front and it’s reasonable to assume that Era will be as well.  Era is the only operator with the financial health and operating strength to acquire assets.  The pool of desperate sellers is enormous.  Thus, the odds favor that a deal being struck on advantageous terms is high.  If they fail on the consolidation front the backup plan is also attractive.  In the Q3 call transcript, management indicated that if they can’t execute a deal, the alternative uses for the excess capital will be explored.   What unfolds is impossible to forecast but I know that buying back stock at 50% of book is massively accretive.Thanks for posting, it’s been fun and illuminating",
"Same remarks as KPdG. i think you miss the elephant in the room here.You can buy assets valued at 22$ (H225 excluded) for 10$. That's all.Era sells his assets above his book value. So you have downsize protection, and an upside of x2 if the oil market downturn is over.  The business of renting helicopters is mediocre (5% ROE) but should be valued at book value as it is earning money.You need to do your models with cash flow from operations not earnings due to a high agressive accounting D&A policy to delay taxes",
"I have a different take.  Superb managment, extremely cheep assets and operating in a deeply cyclical industry at an inflection point make for a tremendous opportunity.ERA was spun from SEACOR Holdings.  CoB of CKH is Charles Fabrikant.  Google has background and you will learn he is one of the great money makers in the offshore space.  He is also CoB of the board of ERA and largest individual shareholder.  While virtually every company operating in the offshore space had to recapitalize and flush their shareholders, ERA repurchased close to 30% of their bond issue at decent discount to face.  Amazingly, book value per share exited the downturn higher than than where it was prior to the downturn.  I can’t think of a managment team that did a better job managing the downturn.  Just ask BRISTOW or CHC shareholders.Super conservative accounting.  Annual third party appraisals always exceed Equity.  Book value per share at Q end stood at $22.22. ERA settled their 225 litigation for $42mm cash plus vendor credits.  As a result they exited Q3 with $48mm in cash plus an untapped $124mm revolver.  Since 2011, Era has booked over $50mm of gains on asset sales.Industry is turning.  Check the transcripts of Era customers or operators where Era has assets.  Gulf of Mexico turn has begun.  Brazil should start in 2019.Consolidation is about to happen.  Era has been vocal about their interest in picking up distressed assets.  As virtually the only qualified buyer, expect any deal to be a materially positive to NAV and earnings power.You can probably guess I’m a shareholder.",ERA Group: Not Taking Off Anytime Soon

Rigosertib looks to have much broader application -- INSPIRE in higher risk R/R, and Oral Rigo as frontline in lower risk...  Long ONTX.",

"Who else is pumped for the February 7 KOL presentation?  Did anyone know that K-RAS mutated lung cancer is (presumably) the next indication up for a Rigo clinical trial?  I sure didn't.  But then I googled some things and this document turned up from an issue of CEOCFO Magazine: ceocfomobile.com/...I hadn't seen this interview before...seems like it should be listed on Onconova's IR page, but I couldn't find it there.  The new (at least to me) focus on Rigo as a possible drug for K-RAS mutated lung cancer reminded me of something I had seen when I first started getting into diligence on ONTX.  When I was digging around for info on CDK4/6 inhibitors in an effort to learn more about ON 123300, I came across this article: www.ascopost.com/...Although the whole article is interesting as it relates to learning about CDK4/6 inhibitors and potential cancers that they may be able to treat, what really caught my eye was this:""Could combinations of CDK4/6 inhibitors with targeted agents improve treatment benefit in NSCLC?In NSCLC, CDK4/6 inhibitor monotherapy has produced more stable disease than responses. There may be better efficacy if we combine CDK4/6 inhibitors with other agents, especially those that target downstream components of RAS signaling pathways. In many instances, CDK4/6 inhibitors will be drugs that we will use in combination. We already do this with hormonal therapy in estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, with excellent results.""Now, I am not going to say this is some huge piece of news or anything like that...ONTX's CDK4/6 inhibitor hasn't even began its Phase 1 yet.  But, you have to admit, it's at least a little interesting that the Company appears to be interested in conducting a Phase 1 for K-RAS mutated lung cancer using Rigo, which presumably targets RAS signalling pathways.  Could it be that the key to treating this lung cancer is Rigo +  ON 123300? I mean, I'm not getting my hopes up or anything, but it's pretty cool to think that this little company with a handful of employees and a market cap of only $17.5 million ($2.5 million of which just came about today) could be sitting on some pretty major advances in MDS, Breast Cancer and Lung Cancer, not to mention the rare pediatric RASopthies that Rigo will hopefully have some success in (and potentially other indications as well...AML definitely comes to mind as a nature progression if Rigo is successful in HR-MDS).  First things first, and all of that...but this is a really exciting time for ONTX.",
"Great presentation! Thanks for the link, guys.",
Are we expecting anything of substance to be presented tomorrow?,
I'm looking at some of these other companies that are worthless that have market caps 2 to 4 times that of ONTX. I mean complete garbage! It's amazing.,
"I was encouraged to see the news yesterday that Dr. Kumar decided to step down as CEO.  I am surprised that this move also included his resignation from the board.  As the co-founder of ONTX, this must of have been a very difficult decision for him (whether he made it himself or the board made it for him).  I have no idea whether Dr. Kumar is responsible for the lack of any meaningful partnerships, but at this point, a change was needed.  I was initially surprised that they appointed Dr. Fruchtman as the new CEO.  Not that he doesn't have an excellent medical/scientific/academic pedigree, because he most certainly does...but I was hoping for someone with more business leadership experience.  Then I realized that that type of person isn't going to join a $12.5 million market cap company at a salary of $600K per year...so congrats on your new title, Dr. Fruchtman and good luck to you sir!  You are undoubtedly the right man for the job!  On a serious note, I was pleased to read this statement from him in the PR: ""I firmly believe that rigosertib has the potential to support multiple indications in different areas of oncology. In addition, our innovative CDK 4/6 inhibitor, ON 123300, is in advanced pre-IND stage, and is expected to enter the clinic during the first half of the year.""  Although this is just a forward-looking statement and pretty much just fluff, it still means something, to me at least, to see Dr. Fruchtman express that kind of confidence in Rigo.  With respect to On-123300, I wonder if ""enter the clinic"" means that the IND is expected to be approved, or that a Phase 1 will actually start?  I assume it's the former, since they have no money for a Phase 1, but hope it's the latter and that he's banking on ONTX receiving significant funds for a partnership in the very near future.  To me, ""enter the clinic"" means that patients are actually dosed, but maybe the industry uses that phrase more loosely?I also note that the company continues to tell us that additional Rigo partnerships are ""anticipated,"" including one with China.  There's no doubt that the oral formulation of Rigo has the potential to be a very big deal in China (think of all of the rural and less developed areas where patients do not have ready access to a place they can access state of the art treatment centers).  Hopefully any China-specific partnership will require the new partner to fund at least some portion of a Phase 3 for oral Rigo in low-risk MDS, which according to Dr. Raza's January 2018 statements, has tremendous potential (she called it a ""fantastic drug"" for lower-risk MDS and noted that 2 of her patients were ""cured"" from the disease, and another who was going on 6 years of successful treatment).  Until I hear otherwise, I will continue to think that this indication is the ""Big One"" for Rigo.  Not sure why it hasn't received more attention from the company and seems to be on the back burner indefinitely, judging from the latest slide deck and lack of any meaningful comments from the company about it.All in all, I'm still very excited about the ONTX's prospects in 2019.  This is a real company with real pipeline assets that isn't getting the respect it deserves from the investment community.  But after disappointing investors time after time since 2013, that respect will have to be earned by the receipt of non-dilutive financing in the form of partnerships and upfront licensing fees.  Personally, I think the focus on ""regional"" partnerships for Rigo is misplaced at this time (i.e., it's too late for that). At this point, I think they would be better served to enter into a partnership with a BP that gives worldwide rights (ex-Japan/Korea and ex-Latin America) to all forms of Rigo and for all indications in exchange for, lets say, at least $50 million upfront, at least $400 million in biobucks and royalties on net sales starting in the mid-teens and going up to mid-20s?  That $50 million, plus approximately $30 million from the exercise of previously issued warrants once the stock goes above the relevant exercise prices ($6.38 to $6.70) and stays there after the INSPIRE read-out, would go along way to funding the initial development of On-123300 and maybe even advancing some other candidates into the clinic.  Also, Avi, if you are reading this, please make sure any licensing agreement allows ONTX to receive any priority review vouchers that may be awarded by the FDA in the event that Rigo is approved for any of the rare pediatric cancer indications for which Phase 1 trials are supposed to begin soon...that should be an easy give from any partner and could be worth $50 to $100 million.    By the way, I'm basing my guestimates of what ONTX might be able to get in a partnership deal for Rigo on what MEIP received in 2016 for their lead product candidate, Pracinostat.  MEIP got a $20 million upfront payment, up to $444 in biobucks and tiered royalties on net sales, starting in the mid-teens.  Their partner (Helsinn) is also obligated to pay for all global development and commercialization.  While I admittedly don't have the background to know whether Rigo's potential supports a similar type of agreement, I do know that Rigo is significantly further along than Prac was at the time and based on that fact alone, it seems like ONTX should be able to get a much larger upfront payment than $20 million.  But again, I have no industry knowledge...so who knows.I also mentioned MEIP because they are currently running a Phase 2 in HR and VHR-MDS with a combination of oral Pracinostat and Aza.  I was wondering if anyone here has looked into the limited data that MEIP has released on the Phase 2 and compared it to ONTX's published results of oral Rigo and Aza?  I couldn't find much, other than the patient discontinuance rate looks better for MEIP (but with less patients) and the dosing of MEIP looks a lot easier for patients to handle than what is required for oral Rigo and Aza.  MEIP published a CR that was 2% better than ONTX, but that doesn't mean much to me based on the small patient population and I also couldn't tell what the CR measurement time frame was for the MEIP patients.  Anyway, I'm really curious if anyone has done a more in-depth diligence swag comparing Rigo to Prac.",

Well. I took money out a few months ago because I've felt uneasy about the broader market all year. Obviously Happy with that decision.

"Germain/Spartrap, Add me to the list of former Gerniacs who followed you over to ONTX...there's a joke in there somewhere about none of us having any sense and throwing good money after bad, but I am still too angry at JS and the moving of the goal posts in the additional IMerge patients to figure it out.  Anyway, I have followed all of your comments, read the new article a couple times and finally just couldn't resist jumping in as the stock broke down severely over the last couple days.  I have a couple of questions for you.  First, have you considered to what extent will IV Rigo in HR-MDS may compete with oral Rigo/Aza in HR-MDS?  I must be missing something because it seems to me like IV Rigo would be cannibalized by the oral/Aza...a good problem to have at this point since the market is saying Rigo is worth $0 in any form, but still, I would like to understand that better.Second, do you know whether oral Rigo for low-risk MDS is completely dead or not?  The last thing that I read on it was from the Laidlaw KOL interview with Dr. Raza back in January 2018, where she noted that she's had great success with the drug and hopes that they will get funding to start a new trial in LR-MDS.  As I understand it, a new LR-MDS trial would be a Phase III, right, since they have completed a Phase I/II?  I know that Luspatercept is looking like it will become the standard of care in LR-MDS, and of course IMET is still out there too, but it seems like there's still a market for an oral LR-MDS drug in the U.S. because it would presumably be cheaper and would decrease the patient burden considerably.  Anyway, I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts on that.With respect to your article, the only real issue that I see is that your valuation is assuming full ownership of IV Rigo.  I do not think there is any chance that ONTX tries to go it alone on Rigo in any indication.  So I'm assuming they end up with a partnership that gives them somewhere between 20%-50% of net sales.  Hopefully they can get 50% on IV Rigo since they have almost got it across the goal line.  But make no mistake, this company isn't geared for going it alone...they don't have anyone in their executive management that has ever launched a drug from a commercial aspect.  Look at Verastem as an example of why ONTX absolutely has to partner its drugs...VSTM is a company with tremendous executive management, lots of cash and an approved drug and they are struggling.  Granted, most of that is probably market related right now, but ONTX is light years below VSTM from a management experience level and even below Synergy, and we know how that worked out for them...Also, count me in the camp of saying Kumar needs to step down as CEO and stay on the board.  It's not enough to separate the President/CEO roles, in my opinion.  ONTX needs a big pharma deal maker yesterday.  The new SVP from Novartis looks like a great hire, but he's not a deal guy, and the new GC/VP of Corp Dev. may not be enough, as it looks like his experience is not exactly what ONTX needs...plus, I'm concerned he might have had something to do with Spectrum's idiotic decision to announce in a PR that it had filed for BTD, thus crushing the stock price when they had to announce they didn't get it.  Hopefully that wasn't his fault.  Anyway, I'm looking forward to 2019.  It's an exciting time for ONTX and I'm confident they will be able to find a partner to help finance Rigo rather than dilute us at these low levels.",

"I commiserate with both of you, mlnovillo & Krak8282.And, I agree that, from a financial/business perspective, management may leave some things to be desired. I think that the R/S could have probably been handled a little bit better, although ONTX was working with a short deck of cards to begin with. And, while the recent PR of the hiring of new general counsel to, among other things, pursue business development/partnership opportunities seems to be good news, I sincerely hope that management has not been waiting until Ari came aboard to seriously engage interest in oral Rigo. And, I'm not sure that actually including a open call for partnership interest in the PR itself is really confidence inspiring... On the other hand, I think that there are plenty of good reasons for patience with ONTX and its management:- Re: Kumar and his ~ $625-$700k salary -- while I will stop short of defending such a salary as ""reasonable"" for a clinical stage biotech that's burning through cash, all I can say is that the salary is well within range of other similarly situated CEOs, and perhaps even on the low side of that range... - And, I definitely agree that it would be heartening to see some insider buys at this level, however, let's keep in mind that Dr. Reddy still has a pretty sizable stake in ONTX -- I think over 2 million shares (?). - And, Dr. Fruchtman and other recent hires give me confidence that, for all of the shortcomings that management might have from the pure business perspective, ONTX science is standing strong. And, for that matter, Germain's article emphasizes the scientific savvy of the group -- the adaptive design, and pinpointing a subsection of patients for which Rigo has the highest chance of being most effective. This strikes me as a group that really knows what it wants to prove, and will not accept any substitutes -- even if that means that results may be delayed. - With regard to price swings: what can we really say? We're talking about a nanocap company -- at one point this morning, ONTX was up around 7% on 6,151 shares traded... That those sharp upward moves can quickly be reversed to the downside is part of the territory.- I do wish that there were some news that would protect/elevate share price sustainably, however, I'm also keeping in mind the general market that we're in -- and XBI has been hit harder than the rest. For example, in any ""normal"" market, it's very likely that the ASH oral presentation results themselves would have been that catalyst for upward move in s/p. Clearly it has not been for ONTX, but that is consistent with nearly every other biotech that has also presented very positive mid-stage data. - Now, a positive partnership would be a different story -- I believe that it would be a catalyst that would command attention, even in these turbulent times... Long ONTX.",
"12:30 and only 6,000 shares traded. Could you imagine if this company actually had any kind news to share regarding a partnership?",
Amazing the market cap is below 20 million. And management has done nothing to prevent this from continuing to fall.,
Why doesn't ONTX have a US collaboration/partnership to fund their program?  They have to continually dilute investors.,

"I am a hematologist at a tertiary center with 40years of experience. I have been a long time supporter of ONTX. They have been criticized because the earlier failed study, ONTIME(published in the Lancet in 2016), was used to develop the groups to be studied in the current INSPIRE trial. ONTX, with the guidance of its medical advisory board, retrospectively selected the sub-groups in the failed ONTIME study which showed a + response to Rigosertib to study in the INSPIRE trial. This is the same process used by Cellator for its study of secondary AML, and the second study based on the selection of favorable sub-groups from the initial study was successful with a b/o of Cellator for a couple of billion!  My ""guesstimate"" for the success of ONTIME is 60-70%. There are not too many biotechs where you can potentially have a 50x pop with a successful study. Keep in mind that INSPIRE has an SPA with the FDA, so if it is positive, it will rapidly be cleared by the FDA. I would add as an aside that I have been in contact with management on several occasions and have been impressed with their resilience and scientific integrity. At the least, I think we can expect a runup in the share price in late 2019 as we get close to the readout of INSPIRE.",

Huge shift and the Asians will take over production if they don't want it.  Closing those plants means they're moving away from manufacturing and production.   You can switch those plants over to whatever you want to make like they did in WW 11 but they don't want them at all.

"One element we always seem to overlook, and we in business never learn from our corporate failures. One has to believe GM did not suddenly find themselves in this situation.  They ignored the situation for the near-term benefit of we shareholders and executives.  Doing something is very risky doing nothing has extreme short-term benefits. The automotive distribution and supply chain changes will happen, but I suspect not as planned.  I have ridden in a Zipcar, and car sharing with a good amount of vomit and urine odors.  There are benefits to having your own transportation asset.Electrics are great as we see the progress being made by the battery industry and the electric vehicle not asking the user to change their behavior as the propulsion system changes. So should GM layoff and dissipate assets.  They seem to have no choice, so it is a decision less empowered by wisdom and more on opportunism.   So why are the growth targets and redeployment of cash and other assets? Retraining of people into data management seems not to be part of the story?  It all seems incomplete.  The union could help, but they also seem to have no plan to renew the company.  So maybe GM should die from no one caring",

In the absence of the PUZ, building permits can no longer be issued for the gold mine.The Certej mining project PUZ, approved by the Certeju de Sus Local Council, through HCL 11/2010, sets out the local regulations on land use and construction of quarries, tailings ponds and the proposed processing plant related to the proposed exploitation. As a result of the cancellation of the plan, the issuance of any authorization documents based on this act becomes impossible.""It is by far the most important step in stopping this illegal mining project. The court found that the advance of the mine, which would use 1,653 tons of cyanide per year and create only 221 jobs, was done in violation of the law. It is not the first time the mining operator has shown that he defies the laws of Romania. In 2014 illegal construction began and the court's intervention was needed to stop the illegalities, ""said Roxana Pencea Bradatan, founding director of Mining Watch Romania.The Cluj Court found that the Environmental Notice for this Zonal Urban Plan was issued in violation of environmental legislation and, at the same time, annulled the decision no. 11/2010, issued by the Local Council of Certeju de Sus commune.The Environmental Notice canceled by the Cluj Court was issued by the Regional Environmental Protection Agency of Timis (ARPM Timiş) in April 2010, following a procedure that lasted about three years. The legal action for the cancellation of the mining project PUZ was launched in 2016 by the Independent Center for Environmental Resources Development, an association that provides the secretariat of the Mining Watch Romania network. The same association obtained in 2015 the cancellation of the PUZ for the mining project at Roşia Montană, a decision that led to the definitive termination of the Roşia Montană Project authorization procedure.""After many years of monitoring the proposed mining projects in Romania, I have not even seen a single law enforcement project.

"Citizens vs. Eldorado Gold Certej 1:003/12/2018	 2485 viewsMining Watch Romania welcomes the decision [1] of the Ministry of Waters and Forests (MAP) to immediately stop proceedings over removing 56 hectares of forests from the country’ Forestry Fund. The subsequent deforestation of that area, equivalent to a surface of 113 football fields, is crucial for Deva Gold to develop the cyanide-based gold mine in Certej. All in all, a total of 165 hectares of forests would need to be cut to make way for the gold mine. Some are protected under European regulation as Natura 2000 sites.The Certej gold mine proposal also known as Deva Gold S.A. is a joint venture between Canadian-based Eldorado Gold (80%) and state-owned Minvest Deva (20%). Eldorado Gold, a low cost Canadian gold mining company (TSX:ELD & NYSE:EGO), intends to open Romania’s first cyanide based open-pit gold mine. However, the proposed Certej gold mine project has been beleaguered by scandals, operational problems, setbacks and national, and international opposition due to the use of very large amounts of cyanide and the destruction of pastures, forests and even protected forests (N2000). Similar to the halted Rosia Montana mine, Romanians generally associate the Certej proposal with corruption at the highest political level.The ministry’s decision comes in result of over 4,500 opinions, suggestions and comments submitted by Romanian citizens as part of a public consultation procedure. Their interventions proved that clearing the 56 hectares of forests would be illegal. This presents an important victory for the country’s civil society organisations and community members who participated in the public consultation.To develop the Certej mine Eldorad’s Deva Gold requires these forested lands. They are the only possible location for the cyanide tailings dams (TMF), as indicated by several feasibility studies. However, in order to build the dams, Eldorado’s Deva Gold S.A. needs to obtain the right to use the land and to clear the forests.In order to obtain these rights, Deva Gold omitted or failed to notify the authorities about ongoing litigation over the forest area. “This is not the first illegality committed by the mining operator. In 2014, Deva Gold started making way to access the construction site in the absence of a legal construction permit. And better still, the permit was even cancelled in court”, said Roxana Pencea from Mining Watch Romania.The 56 hectares of forest are currently part of a lengthy restitution procedure at court. According to applicable law, no decision may be taken over lands that are under a restitution procedure until a final judgment has been taken over the original landownership.Moreover, a high-level journalist investigation [2] showed the abusive way the forest was leased to the mining company. In spring 2018 the Romania’s Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) Alba initiated a criminal prosecution over the forests’ transfer of ownership from the state to the local town hall. Barely one month after having obtained the title deed, the town hall leased the forests to Deva Gold for 20 years.“The suspension of the deforestation procedure is a heavy blow for the mining company and a strong victory for people power. This is a great encouragement to continue with our strategic litigation activities and opposition. We want and will make sure that the rule of law is applied as far too many citizens suffer from the effects of the abuse of power such as the destruction of protected forests etc.”, adds Roxana Pencea from Mining Watch Romania.Notes:The Certej mining project is held by Deva Gold SA, a joint-venture between Eldorado Gold (80%) and the state company Minvest Deva (~20%).[1] apepaduri.gov.ro/...[2] miningwatch.ro/...[3] The 8 perimeters are: Certej, Săliște Hondol, Băița Crăciunești, Certej Nord, Troița Pițiguș, Mireș, Sângerei and Bolcana.",

The metallurgical plant is an explicit ON/OFF term of the contract, yet under the terms of the environmental approval the company cannot now simply opt for a different technology. Simply put, without flash smelting there is no investment at all.Οnly the Council of State has the jurisdiction and power to annul the ministerial decision that rejected the technical study, if it decides it was illegally issued.

As a contributor he should be more careful and acknowledge that EGO has announced plans how to achieve this goal.2) “They'll be lucky to produce 340,000 ounces for FY-18.”: In the Q3 2018 PR EGO increased guidance to 345,000-350,000 ozs of gold in 2018. This was a second guidance increase for 2018 from the original guidance of 290,000-330,000 ozs! If EGO is able to produce 340,000 ozs of gold in 2018, it should be considered a good thing and not just lucky.3) “AISC for the first 9 months of 2018 was $1,274/oz - 5% above the spot gold price. That's ""low""?”: However, $1,274/oz is the average realized gold selling price for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018. Gold AISC for the same period was $944/oz. Clearly, a human mistake. But making such a mistake may affect the conclusions.4) “What are high AISC? $1,600?”: A pretty arrogant comment. Obviously he wants to emphasize that EGO is not a low-cost gold producer.

"I think most traditional valuation methods have been thrown out the window when it comes to eldorado, it seems to be valued based entirely on precieved risk of continuing operations with a very negative out look.In market cap terms ego is much lower than most variations using the block model method, owner earnings dcfs, npvs, ect. The market reacted negatively to the reduction in olympias reserves, which is indeed warranted, but when considering 27.2Moz of proven and probable gold and gold equivalents $16.90/oz is ridiculous.On the plus side 159k oz were added costing around 20M, which is cost effective. But I think for the moment they should be focused on conservation of cash. Drilling is similar to Capex, and can be post poned, so why not? The difference of 30 to 60 million over the next 2 years is quite a bit when it comes to the Kisladag Capex. I calculate they could do the Capex while continuing d&e, but 60m is almost 2 years of bond payments, and would look so much better as treasury stock.

Did it give investors the change they can believe in?The evidence would say not really.""I say: ""You are 100% correct....SPOT on!""You said:""It's good to see that we largely agree on the basic principle that checks have done quite well compared to the acquired companies in the past but the future for checks looks grim.""I say:""15 years ago everybody, in the company, and outside the company, was saying, ""the future for checks looks grim"" and everybody is still saying it.  The DLX check business has been nothing short of a CASH cow these past 15 years, much to the surprise of everybody!.  The end of checks will happen in the future, but when, and how fast will it happen, is the question. Square (SQ) acceptance and the end of ""old school"" check users, I believe, are key factors.  The check business reminds me of a wet sponge. Squeeze it to get all the water out.  When the water is gone the sponge is all dried up, just like checks will be.  The only question that can't be answered is how much water is in the sponge and how hard will it be squeezed.Again, very nice analysis!",
"Can you explain why you portray checks as having a product type operating margin of only 25%? Considering direct checks is 85% checks and has an operating margin of 33%, checks have to atleast have a product operating margin of 33%. In addition, using the category revenue by segment and the operating margin of each segment, I   did a simple for the operating margins of each product type (3 equations, 3 unknowns), and I came up with operating margin of 40% for checks, -4% for forms, and .7% for marketing and solutions.  It looks to me that this check company has simply continued to increase profitability of their checks and maintain revenue by increasing prices. Check revenue dropped 5% this year so far (612.5 vs 645 mil for the 9 months leading up to q3). In my opinion, this is a check company that makes money primarily from checks, and has been unsuccessfully acquiring other companies to replace their check profitability. In addition, they've continued to waste money on buy backs, instead of paying out earnings as dividends. Considering their incredibly impressive P/E, which is about 9 for adjusted earnings, I think this is a play where the only question is how much longer people will continue to purchase checks. Personally, I think checks are on their way out in the next decade, and would expect the y/y decline  to increase from 5% onwards. Based on their ineffectual ability to manage other categories besides checks, along with their destruction of capital with buybacks and acquisitions, and check revenue possibly declining by > 5% every year, I think this company is a clear short.",
"Manders, yours is an excellent analysis and confirms Michael Boyd's analysis of several months ago. I have been a longtime DLX owner and have been pleased that over the last decade they have taken checks from 80% of revenues to around 40% (direct checks plus sales to institutions). I agree they now need to juice more margin out of small business services and slow down acquisitions. They should be able to do that because they have a fairly wide menu of services they can sell to small businesses. Another area of opportunity is forms. The nature of that industry makes it boring. But it is highly fragmented and scale efficiencies are there for the taking thru acquisitions. They should copy ENNIS's (EBF) approach to forms. EBF does very well.",

"About 70 - 80% of a stock's price action can be attributed to the price movement of its industry group. Just now, the S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) appears to be making a series of lower highs and lower lows - a bearish trend - while its mirror image, the 3x short Direxion Daily Semiconductor ETF, is tracing out what appears to be a bottom supported by strong volume. As noted by others, semiconductors are profoundly cyclical. Roman, you have written a very interesting analysis, and it is always possible that your optimism will prevail. However, I am remembering the Dot.com bear market in 2000, when a distinguished analyst kept insisting that the earnings and other fundamentals of his favorite internet stocks should prevail no matter what the markets were doing. Needless to say, this led to major losses for him and his followers. No one knows the future, but fundamentals deal with information that is always from three to six months old, depending on the timing of the quarterly earnings reports. Charts do not infallibly predict the future, but they do offer an up-to-the minute assessment by investors about a stock's  future worth. When markets make major turns, it is the chart readers who most often catch on first and who consequently may be able to preserve more of their capital for a time when prices turn up again. If one looks at prior market downturns, it becomes clear that a major downtrend can often take six months to a year or so to play itself out. The devastation to prices can be beyond what anyone who has never lived through a real bear market can easily imagine. The greater devastation to one's emotions and self-confidence is also unmatched by any other investing experience. So if we are in such a downtrend, the focus on capital preservation should be our top priority for perhaps the next six months to one year or so. Be careful out there, Roman. ""He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day.""",

"I think your DCF assumptions are not as conservative as they appear. Projecting at a 35% EBITDA margin seems aggressive when only two years ago it was less than 16% (high degree of variability). Your WACC seems way too high, but maybe it offsets your optimistic/aggressive assumptions. Still you are valuing the company at 7.5 times 2023 revenue, which seems way too high for my tastes. NVDA has to more than double its revenue and you are still valuing it above 7 times revenue in 2023. The 2018 P/S ratio is almost 18 today based on your valuation. Another way to look at it - if you bought the whole company in 2023 for 7.5 times revenue and the company dropped 100% to the bottom line, it would still take you almost 8 years to break-even on your investment. I think this is just a case of too much of the value of the company being dependent on future assumptions about supra-normal growth. In those instances you can make a DCF model tell you whatever you want to hear.",
"At this point the crypto hangover and what it meant for NVDA in the past year is no more a mystery. However there is one more thing that needs more analysis: bitcoin peak has been reached roughly at beginning of 2018 and cryptocurrencies have decreased their value since, and with that has decreased the profitability of mining with GPU. However even in the last quarter NVDA had gaming revenue at very high levels while demand related to crypto should have ceased well before. Moreover they projected 700M$ less revenue from gaming due to not selling 1060 in next quarter and still foresee 2.7B$. This means that when this glut will be over, revenue should be back to at least >3B$ levels, which means that not all growth of past quaters is gone for good.This points to a temporary nature of the problem (like management says) and not a fundamental one. Am I wrong?",
Sorry but semis are highly cyclical.This means that when revenue falls …. it falls.And when revenue falls margins collapse.Looking at 5 yr projections with a fixed growth rate/margin is not the way to evaluate the opportunity. OK for SaaS businesses but not capital intensive semisIf you want value in semi then I believe you are best looking at historically low P/Bs or P/Ss.When P/Es are low in semis it means the market is expecting a big fall in earnings …. and there tends to be wisdom in markets.You say the price makes no sense but it makes sense to the market.

"I would have to disagree with your analysis of RTX being a future positive.  Basically NVDA invested in, some could some could say gambled on, a technology that is between 4-7 years from mainstream adoption.Now first results are from an actual game and I’m afraid the results are a major disappointment.  Instead of driving forward on their core strength (“CUDA”) vs their competitors weaker architecture (“GCN”), they have dropped the ball as the technology for high resolution high framerate has hardly moved from Pascal to Turing.  What’s more is once RTX is enabled you lose the high resolution high framerate combination.Initial RTX (Turing) sales were part due to overhyping and also due to the 1% of gamers wanting the next best thing after having had Pascal for a year too long.RTX cards are expensive to produce, think giant 754mm2 die for RTX2080ti, and so carry a 70% price premium for only small performance gains.I think it was telling that RTX2070 cards were on Black Friday sales at below MSRP when the MSRP was the price NVDA was the price it was charging its customers, the Add-in Board Partners (AIBs).I would strongly suspect that the RTX2080ti cards are suffering supply issues due to poor yields due to giant die size even on a mature process node.  Now this is coupled with QA issues with customers complaining of cards that are either DOA or exhibiting artifacting and you have an even bigger problem.The vast market majority of the GPU market is GTX1060 or below, so beyond early adopters and the 1% of gamers that can afford and justify having the best of the best, Turing as an architecture that while ground breaking is DOA.For RTX to be successful it will require the games consoles to support it, that’s where games developers focus the majority of their resources.  Simply put even the next generation of consoles due late 2019 or in 2020 will not support RTX technology.The RTX technology itself is groundbreaking, but NVDA has gone too early in the gaming market.  Their mis-step is akin to Intel’s woes with 10nm giving AMD an opportunity to become more competitive with Navi especially if they target GTX1080 performance at the sub $300 price.",

"Using DCF is like trying to fly a plane.With the right training and experience, in weather you can handle, you can regularly get to where you need to go pretty fast.In the hands of someone without all of that, it is a pretty good recipe to crash and burn.I don't think NVDA is a great place to try to fly your plane - more like trying to take off in the early stages of a hurricane. The P/S and P/FCF divergence over the last 5 years is a warning sign. High margins are built into future assumptions. In any kind of glut, miners going bust scenario, used GPUs flooding the market, those margins will be crashing. The P/S could easily return to pre-2015 levels, in which case anything over $100 is wildly optimistic.",
"@Roman Luzgin Agree with the title of your article but just remember that the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent.I remember in 1997 AAPL traded for $17. AAPL had a market cap of $2.1B, even though it had $2.2B in cash and ST securities on its balance sheet! The reasoning was that Steve Jobs would burn the cash and take the company down rather than shut it down, as infamously suggested by Michael Dell.In 2000, 3COM sold off 5% of its interest in Palm Pilot before spinning it off in an IPO. The prices that resulted after the IPO ""made no sense"" -  3COM's market cap dropped to $28 billion, or $23 billion less than the value of its holdings in Palm, which had risen to a market cap of $53 billion. (Remember, 3COM still owned 95% of Palm)Think Palm was an easy short, and/or 3COM a long? Think again....the market mispricing persisted for about four weeks.Not.Making.This.Up.",

"I loved NVDA 2 years ago. But last ER showed, high inventory, even the gaming is actual gamers: a graphics card can last 5-8 years for new cards.

"I would've agreed if you called the valuation attractive, but I can't really call it ""low"" at all, let alone that it is too low to the point that it ""makes no sense.""  The TTM p/s is still something around 8, and it will be higher given same stock price if their Q4 guidance proves correct.Anyone investing in this should understand that it still has a lot of premium built in for expectations of future successes in still-emerging applications, and if those don't materialize it definitely could go lower. As is almost always the case with long-term growth stocks, the potential significant reward is accompanied by significant risk.",
"I think this analysis is overly generous.  To say that there is upside to the tune of $175 with the slowing growth and downside guidance is a little wild in my mind.That said, I will start to nibble at NVDA here.  I think at the very least the valuation has returned to reasonable levels.  It is now at or near fair value, perhaps just slightly on the expensive side.",
"The author is on something. This stock is at a massive sales multiple, sales are now shrinking, margins temporarily went very high due to crypto and are now under pressure. All growth areas will be subject to competition, long term sustainable margins are far far lower. You would have to be insane to buy this on “valuation” grounds. Next year when it keeps shrinking and the revisions go lower it will get back to 50-80 range. Still nice for those that brough at 25 a couple years ago, but not for those who’ve brought into the bs and hype.",
"The author presents a DCF model suggesting that the fair value of the company is about $175 per share, which is well above the current price. So there are a number of possibilities that would explain this discrepancy.1. The market does not use DCF to price the stock. In this case, the DCF analysis is irrelevant to stock price movement.2. The market is using different DCF assumptions than the author to price the stock, in which case the author's DCF analysis is inaccurate as it relates to the real world price of the stock.3. There are other factors at work in market pricing of the stock than DCF, which are influencing the price the market will pay for the stock. In this case, unless the author can identify the other factors and the relative importance of those factors in future stock price action, it is not possible to evaluate the usefulness of the DCF model in predicting future price movement.My conclusion is that at any given time, the market prices stocks based on a complex mix of fundamentals, sentiment, news reports, and paranoia. The DCF model, while appropriate perhaps if you were buying the company (think Warren Buffett), appears to have little value in predicting future price movement of the stock.",

"Crude man:  I don't like it when they don't share all the info either especially of things that don't work out.  Like what ever happened to EOG's Bakken EOR from 2008?  Another example is CLR was showing detailed info for every STACK well that they drilled for a while.  And then they stopped (makes me think decline, especially of the oil portion, was a problem).  Could also be that with time, the downspaced well competition increased and became a bigger problem (pressure zone spreads out as the well is produced).  Really hard to tell because we don't have the info.   But CLR actually shares a good amount of insights.  Wish they did more, really.  But still they have been more honest about parent-child.  For instance, the testing I showed for SCOOP Springer.  Many of their peers seem to want to act as if there is ZERO cannibalization...absurd.  Instead, CLR shows the tradeoff.Note that infill density is clearly a function of price.  In a highly impermeable stratum (shale), more wells means more fracks and more total oil recovered.  Of course it is not linear and the additional wells in the unit do not get as much new oil.  But you definitely can't develop these areas properly with one well per unit.  If the price gets low enough (45?), maybe you do go to two or even one well per unit.  The only project making sense than would be the first one.  But if the price is high enough (100+?), you may want to downspace very heavily (6 or more wells). It's not that the oil amounts changed.  Just that the required EUR for a positive NPV project has changed.I see this concept poorly understood all the time by both shale hypers (who want to say no cannibalization occurs) and by shale critics (who want to say any cannibalization is wrong or that a single fracked horizontal well can drain the whole tight rock unit)",
"PEP, here is the impact from infill drilling based on the CLR data in Springer:wells	EURunit	EURwell	%worse1	1700	1700	0%2	3300	1650	3%3	4200	1400	18%4	4800	1200	29%5	5100	1020	40%6	5300	883	48%First column is number of wells.  Second is EUR for the unit.  Third is EU per well (just unit EUR divided by number of wells).  Fourth is how much of a hit infill drilling does to the average well.  You can see that with one well, there is no hit (baseline).  With two wells, there is 3% hit from cannibalization.  With three wells, they are now 18% worse.  And with four wells, we are at 29% worse.  And then worse and worse.  (See how going from 4 to 5 wells for the section only gives you an incremental 300 for the unit.)  Note that the max PV was at 4 wells, so that implies a 29% reduction in average well performance.  So 30% is not a bad thumbrule.  [Again of course this depends on land quality, price, permeability, etc.  But really, 30% is not a bad thumbrule for full field development versus standalones.]",
"EOGs needs its wells to be more than economic, Company is valued at 4x book value. You need a very high IRR to justify such a valuation. At current WTI, EOG should go down 50% in value, alternatively it could save its remaining acreage for higher prices.",
"Haven't seen them drill too many wells in TX that won't pay out in the last few years. Margins on tier 2-3 obviously not as high as others but EOG's well economics are pretty outstanding. Chalk, Loving, Reeve's and some other EF locations payout absurdly quick.  I've been combing over the production numbers for lease wells in most of their texas plays. Hard to cancel out the noise to really get a good feel for the parent/child question. I think there's some interference, rate acceleration but I don't know that it is the elephant in the room that Kibs is making it out to be. They have drilled a lot of in-fill now on the chalk and WCA which is higher porosity rock than the lower EF. There is some variance with the child wells but for the most part they are in-line with the parent wells. Even at a 10-15% EUR hit they are still economic. Plus infill wells are where you realize your cost synergies so their economics are always going to be better then the first well.",
"There is something that doesn't make sense with EOG statements.  They talk about premium, premium, premium. And say they have several years of inventory that is +30% return (well over any normal WACC) at $40 oil.  But they also say they would decrease drilling with sustained prices at $40.  This doesn't make sense.  Why decrease pace when you have a surfeit of +NPV projects?  Just makes no sense.  For one thing service costs would have dropped and made the returns even better than 30%!  Plus they actually did reduce pace when oil dropped hard before.  The easy explanation to me is that the ""premium"" projects are really not +NPV. I am open to other explanations.  But at a minimum it makes no sense and seems like stupid boasting communication.  I say this with a lot of respect for EOG land and practices.  But the whole ""premium"" branding seems like voodoo economics.  Since my interest is in understanding the industry, I hate flawed and misleading explanations.  Even from good companies.  Don't pollute the airwaves.P.s.  Shallow, how does low 50s impact you?  OK?",
"Most people that can read a financial statement, know that EOG is not profitable at current prices. On an individual well basis, you can show return, but then you have all the other stuff that certainly adds up.EOG has the highest profitability because it has a majority of its operation in Eagle Ford which has a higher oil price than Permian. That will even out next year with more pipelines. Furthermore, EOG can not grow Eagle Ford any longer as it only has 8-9 years of acreage left in the basin. Sure, then can grow 30-40% more there, but then it will run out even faster.This is not Amazon, that can operate in perpetuity, EOG has a fixed amount of acreage and it is running out fast without making a dime. Those 1 billion in profits in Q3, would have been close to zero at current prices. If it plans to grow next year, it will spend more than cash flow...Maybe it should suspend its dividend??",
"Sure, when you have the core of the core in a ton of plays, you can operate comfortably.At $40 oil though, they won't be operating that comfortably, unless they go back to just holding acreage with a lone well.This is because when they go to development mode, they severely over drill, causing significant interference and wasted capital. It also helps them that they charge the non-op owners an arm and a leg for the ""privilege"" of having EOG ""operate"" the wells for them.",
"Since we are now dealing with low oil prices again I am going to have to get cranky again about this kind of talk.First of all, $40 oil as in what?  WTI?  At the well?  Hedges included?Secondly, could you be a little more specific with regard to what has changed that would cause EOG to earn strong returns at low oil prices when EPS figures for 2015, 2016 and the first three quarters of 2017 indicate the contrary?  My understanding was that well costs had increased since the lows of 2016.  Also, I was of the understanding that, after several years of productivity gains, 2018 was showing little in well productivity gains.  Finally, is SLB wrong about the child well problems??  How many more #1's does EOG have left, or is most of the remaining acreage infill on HBP?EOG said a lot of crap in early 2016 because, if oil prices had stayed in the $30s for about three years, they, along with most of the rest of the onshore North American upstream industry would have been toast.  Management said a lot of stuff despite evidence to the contrary in EOG's own SEC reserve report, which showed the company wholly uneconomic at WTI oil prices in the $30s.  EOG is among the cream of the crop in the US onshore space.  However, they and the rest of the industry drilled and completed a lot of wells in 2015, 2016 and 2017 that will never payout, and it appears they are set to do the same thing again in 2019, assuming WTI stays here or goes even lower, and in particular if the basis in the Permian for both oil and gas continues to be pressured.",

Take a look at the ""Max"" view to see all of the past recessions:fred.stlouisfed.org/...What this artificial tariff growth slowdown has done is simulated 2015 but this isn't a fundamental weakness in the global economy, it is because of the hoarding nature of companies before the tariffs went in place. This was pretty obvious by all the news articles discussing massive truck driver shortages all over the country when the tariffs were announced, they were even accepting ones with criminal records. Now the drivers are all being let go.Combine this fact that governments all over the world (particularly China and the U.S.) have been loosening banking regulations allowing them to hold less cash in reserve and sub-prime mortgages which have recently appeared in the U.S and China.See, there's the rub. The whole point of instability was to justify corporate tax breaks and cause a massive flood of liquidity under false pretenses of a global slowdown. The corporate tax breaks weren't spent on expanding capacity, it was used by the majority of companies to reduce debt. None of this money has benefited the average person, only the people well off enough to own companies or shares.Once the brakes come off and there is an agreement resolving any global uncertainty, then we're in an economy with record company profits and massive amounts of excess liquidity sloshing around. Smells like the perfect setup for one last massive market rally to me. Again, this doesn't benefit the average person, only people wealthy enough to have market investments or own companies.",

"I opened the 70 call at 43. In the interim the price fell to 102 (a lucky start). My thinking was a matter of added safety in the 70. If there is a violent move I can react, but if not I think  that the stock will rise to much higher levels with a rising oil price and Permian exposure. Based on what it might do, I might prefer to wait, exercise the call and keep the stock, I get a stock basis at 113, not 123, for the premium. The put idea would be safer, but I could not tie up that amount of cash for that period of time. Somehow, I am more uncomfortable with calls than puts, likely due to lack of use.",
"One problem I would worry about with the Jan 2021 strike date is the premium may not move as much as you have calculated using Black Scholes. I am not convinced that the delta would move the premium that much over a short period of time. Being deep in the money helps, but the risk is whether it will actually move the premium that much over a month or so, even if the price does go up by that amount. To me, selling puts here might be more worth the effort, without the larger financial outlay.",

Whopping 1.85 Billion deal just announced:  Gilead And Agenus Enter into Collaboration to Develop Immuno-Oncology Therapies.  CGEN might produce a similar headline one day in the not so distant future....,
Lots of work...Mr. Goldman,
"I think you, ARK and others are over-estimating the value of CGEN's discovery engine. COM-701, TIGIT, and ILDR2 are far enough along to prove that CGEN's algorithms work so whether any or all of those drugs succeed or fail doesn't change anything with regard to the discovery platform. All drugs, regardless of how discovered, face the same challenges in human trials.The problem is that big pharma has shown zero interest in discovery platforms and instead buys out or enters into collaborations with companies that have advanced the drugs through at least Phase 1. While it seems intuitive that a computer program that can identify novel drug targets would be extremely valuable, this hasn't turned out to be the case. Big pharma doesn't want to spend the time and money doing the research necessary to confirm the viability of novel early stage targets. This is borne out by the fact that despite CGEN continuing to maintain that their business model is to license out drug targets at various stages of development, they have been able to sign only two deals in the last five and half years for early stage targets, both for upfront payments of only $10 million- a drop in the bucket to a large pharmaceutical company. Furthermore, they have been unable to partner 15001 despite claiming that it represents a ""paradigm shift"" in immuno-modulatory treatment of auto-immune diseases. They apparently have had so little interest from big pharma in this drug that instead of partnering it and using the proceeds to fund COM-701 trials, they recently did a secondary offering on very unfavorable terms, diluting existing shareholders significantly for relatively little return. Despite maintaining for four or five years, and continuing to maintain that their intention is to partner 15001, they have been unable to do so and refuse to comment on it.Compugen's future lies solely on the success or failure of COM-701. They obviously don't have the money to bring additional candidates into clinical trials and, as I stated, the early stage candidates are of very little value to big pharma. Also, for those of us who have been invested for over a decade, waiting until a myeloid target or some other early stage candidate makes it into the clinic is not an option.",

"This is an extremely high risk portfolio/approach and likely won't get you to $2 million in the time frame you're looking at. FIRE is all the rage the past few months, but taking a high risk investment approach is not part of it.Almost 50% in P2P lending? Whew! That will likely undermine the entire plan.With the $80,000 per year contributions, it will require an annual growth rate of 11% to reach $2 million in 8 years - which is not likely. First, on the P2P - it's almost half of the portfolio, and you've capped the return at 9% maximum, while taking high risk with it. At most it will return $20k per year, but could just as easily lose $20k per year. You don't get 9% for one year lending without assuming a very high level of risk.Then another $40k that is leveraged/short? SMH!Get rid of the P2P and leverage and stick the $220k in a 5 year CD today which will guarantee 3.7%. How to make up the annual $12k (maximum) differential - worst case, you work/save an extra year. More likely, if you're able to bank $80k per year today, with salary increases and other ways you find to save over time, you'll make up that difference. Mid-30-year-old you haven't even hit your peak earnings yet.If you were to do absolutely nothing with the funds, keeping it all in cash earning that 3.7% 5-year CD rate, adding your $80k/year, at the end of 8 years you'd be guaranteed to have $1.35 million. Though that will not be the $2 million goal, for a 45-year old, that is an incredible amount of money to have saved...and it is a guarantee taking absolutely no risk. At that point, though you might not be able to completely retire, you'd likely be able to leave full-time employment, maybe take a mindless part-time gig to cover discretionary spending, and watch the $1.35 million grow to $2 million over the following 10 years - again, just at the 3.7% annual CD yield with no risk.

"Prior to Trump's trade war with China brought on by idiotic tariffs, the average  American consumer received what amounted to a 10,000$ a year subsidy through the purchase of low  priced goods; this has been a boom for low and middle class incomes.Free trade with China has  benefited both countries.Since Trump put stupid tariffs on Mexico, Canada,E.U.and China global supply chains have  been disrupted resulting in higher cost for American business and consumers; tariffs are taxes that hurt commerce. A number of economist are predicting a recession next year brought on by Trump's trade war  as a result of Hoover protectionist policies.",
"China engages in fair trade; we ship them agriculture products,LNG, and Boeing aircraft; they in turn ship us goods to fill up Walmart; the exchange of goods is of mutual benefit.",
"Tariffs will end when both countries lose enough money to make the screaming and hissing by citizens and the media too loud to tolerate.Esoteric theories of macroeconomics fall away when politicians (in both/all countries) can't eat at restaurants w/o taking flack from other customers and when the younger politicians are asked by the parking lot attendant why Tariffs are a good thing.Politicians (in both countries) don't really care much about the pain, because they don't suffer the pain.  They care about being left alone.  The louder the noise, the more they want it to stop.  Remember:  the vast majority of politicians in the U.S. go to Congress the fatten their net worth -- if they actually do something beneficial for anyone else, it was an accident.  (I'm excluding monies spent by Lobbyists, in those cases, the politicians do everything possible to earn the graft.)",
Trump made a stupid move when he lost his leverage with China when he withdrew from the great trade pact known as the TPP.

Trump has been railing against free trade for the last 30 years; he now openly admits he is a tariff man which straight out of Herbert   Hoover's playbook.,

For a number of reasons, I think that margin profile is going to be stronger than many expect. If it is, traditional PE comps become less relevant. I’m not suggesting that Apple should be selling at 30x earnings. Only that something like 17-20x might all of a sudden make much more sense given the shear size of the Services business together with the reliability of the HW business. None of that even takes into account what is likely to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $25B in share buybacks that I’d expect to happen this quarter. They didn’t buy a lot last quarter (relatively speaking) and I’m guessing that they’re probably making up for it right now.",
I find this analysis ludicrous. Understanding Apple totally lacking here and with most analysts. This has created a special situation that can take AAPL to new highs post earnings as stock buyback and services growth expands. Focus on suppliers is and has been previously a mistake!,

It's one of the features of GDPR that every web page that intends to gather information about you, must inform the user with a ""yes/no"" popup or starting page about their intention of doing so. Once the user answers the question, the setting will be saved and it wont be asked again. This was introduced during FB Q2.

The stock price is mostly about the multiple Mr.  market assigns it and Mr Market doesn't like uncertainty in terms of government regulations, liabilities from fines and potential hacks. Every legislative body will have a go at FB because they are easy to blame for society's problems, rightly or wrongly. The argument is not whether or not FB will have meet their earnings projections, but when, if ever, will these ""overhang"" issues go away?  Sadly, IMO if these overhangs persists or even worsen, I fear FB stock will languish, no matter the earnings.  I am long FB but at times it's hard to watch.",
"@Julian Lin The buybacks. I like the buybacks. But couple of points to note. Agreed 100% of FCF and a little more went into buybacks. But it is having a real small effect. Last Q 4B+ spent in buying back shares, buy 1B+ went the opposite way. ESOPs to employees. And the EV/FCF is a high ratio at the moment, so share repurchases just led to a drop of 50 Milliion out of 2958 million the entire year. Also I don't think management is being smart on when they buy the shares. They bought them all over the place. At 200+, 170, whatever. Given that they just started the buyback in 2017, less time frame to judge them. Next few Qtrs will tell us whether they buy the shares significantly at $135 odd. I am bullish FB too. Risks are more regulations. Do you know what form they might take? And also the Sales tax in EU. However the sales tax in EU, a number of member countries seem to oppose it due to a fear that the U.S will retaliate. Margin pressure like you mentioned I think will come off starting 2020. But I am not knowledgeavle on how this company is expected to grow revenues 20%+ for years to come. Users in the US and Europe are stagnating or coming down. Asia-Pacific and the ROW will provide the growth, but they are low ARPU generators.  So does FB expect the revenues to come in the form of increased ARPU's per user? Is that it or are there other weapons in the arsenal?Management mentioned their focus is on Instagram and Stories and they see revenue potential there, but I hope they start focusing on monetizing Whatsapp as well. But going by management's language, I think they feel this is going to be tough. I hope they also quicken the pace, bring in the Dating app, Ecommerce stuff that they are talking about and Innovate more.Last comment on the employee dissatisfaction.

Doubt it --- now we're hearing that FacePlant is racist:www.cnbc.com/...DUMP shares...........my target (established 4-5 months ago in FB postings) is sub $100.,
One of Facebook's competitors are being overlooked Amazon. I think Amazon could still still market share from Facebook. Amazon appears to have more revenue streamsand I also think they could be a potential big competitor to ad dollars. I think that is possible as this unfolds that the multiple continues to compress with a possible 12 PE ratio. I prefer Amazon over Facebook due to their diversity of the revenues as well as their ability to compete with Facebook and Google for ad dollars.I own a small position in Facebook and would likely be aggressively buying if it got to $8o to 100 to share.,
FB is currently a good technical buy and fundamental buy.  I don't think you'll have to wait long to see a big run.,

Before I talk more specifically about our sponsor's development activities, I'll provide a brief update on the market and our contracted position. As we profiled in our release, the fundamentals of the biomass market remain extremely strong, and the role of biomass is increasingly being recognized by international and governmental organizations. For its recently published renewable 2018 report, the International Energy Agency is expecting bioenergy to have the fastest growth among all renewable energy sources. The IEA also forecasted that in order to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius this century, the share of modern bioenergy in the world's energy mix will need to more than triple to 17% by 2060.Evolving markets like Germany, the Netherlands and Japan demonstrates how some of that potential turns into real demand. In Germany, the dual goals of ending coal generation to reach its 2050 carbon emissions reduction target and retiring all nuclear capacity by the end of 2022 create base load generation challenges that sustainable biomass is uniquely positioned to solve. In the Netherlands, 27% of total funds in its spring 2018 SDE plus allocation round were awarded to biomass projects. This represents 50 projects and €950 of incentives.",

That brought praise from Wall Street: GM's stock rose more than 5% Monday."" ""In contrast to times past, General Motors, under CEO Mary Barra, is trying to get ahead of a potential crisis by making cuts now,"" said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader.""It is noteworthy that last spring GM announced a breakthrough in battery technology that will bring the cost of batteries down substantially lower than the competition's and is tooling this new technology into the next generation of EVs. 2020 is around the corner.IMO, It appears to me that GM is setting the stage to break Tesla's back and make the company an easy target for a takeover. I have made previous comments regarding the fact that GM has around 30 to 40 years more experience with EVs than any other company.In 1987 GM released its first EV, the Saturn Ion and later produced battery powered mail delivery vehicles for the USPS and battery powered light and medium duty trucks for Southern California Edison and other electric utilities.All of GM's EV were on open end noncancelable leases. GM was forced to recall all of its EVs in the mid 2000s due to the federal government granting tax credits to anyone buying a truck or SUV over 6,000 pounds.GM's EVs were never profitable, with the announced tax credit, this took all of the wind out of the EV market forcing GM to shut down EV production and support.I've been stating for around 2 years that GM is getting ready to take market share in both the EV and driverless car segment.Happy Tesla investing.",

"And, off the top of my head, one of the primary things that forces a company like GNC into bankruptcy is leases.

"@Michael Wiggins De Oliveira , Btw, I have no position in GNC, long or short, and I haven't really looked that deeply at the company. I just read through the quarterly today and quickly looked through a couple of 10-Ks. I think you shouldn't rely as much as you are on FCF. GNC's is not sustainable. On forcing into bankruptcy, take a look at the covenants on the bank debt. I haven't looked at them, but usually they put out a term sheet for bank debt. You can have plenty of room, as you say, but still manage to trip covenants. Do you happen to know what GNC's strategy is for stemming their sales and margin declines? What caused it in the first place?",
"@Michael Wiggins De Oliveira , Sales declining, gross margins declining, operating margins declining, interest costs rising, inventory rising, receivables rising, accounts payable rising. And now, as you point out, with the preferred shares (converts and straight), preferred dividends will eat up the remaining. No offense, but this company will exist, but not for shareholders. It will end up a conduit for the Chinese manufacturers of the vitamins and supplements that they sell. Note who the latest investors are. Three other points referencing your FCF: (1) FCF is declining pretty quickly (last quarter was $2mm) and (2) their working capital changes suggest that their vendors have a short leash on them and they are likely increasing inventory ahead of tariffs.  (3) Note that depreciation and amor. expense is running roughly at 3x capex. That's not sustainable unless they are shrinking drastically or just stealing from their future. Debtholders will remain with the company and the preferred holders have a ready buyer of their products and an option for longshot upside. Common shareholders will likely be left with nothing. They don't have much public debt left, but it's yielding over 14% (trading in the 80's). finra-markets.morningstar.com/...",

Gross margin was 40% in 2012 and EBIT margin was 15%. As of last quarter, BBBY has lost 6.3% of gross margin and 12.3% in EBIT margin. If we assume that the loss in gross margin is permanent, then 6.3% of EBIT margin is gone. So, 15% - 6.3% = 8.7%. What percent of the 8.7% - 2.7% = 6% (the increase in SG&A expense) is permanent? SG&A expense incorporates the build out of BBBY's omnichannel strategy.  From BBBY's latest 10-Q on p. 18, ""Capital expenditures for the six months ended September 1, 2018 and August 26, 2017 were $181.5 million and $177.0 million, respectively. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, approximately 70% of the capital expenditures were for technology projects, including investments in the Company's digital capabilities, and the development and deployment of new systems and equipment in its stores. The remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to new store openings and investments in existing stores.""Let's assume that there is slippage in that number and only 60% of the increase in SG&A is due to the omnichannel build out. So, permanent changes in SG&A would be 40% or 40% x 6% = 2.4%. So, this implies that the add back to operating margin would be 3.6%, eventually. If we add 3.6% to the current 2.7% of operating margin, we get 6.3% operating margin. With flat sales of ~ $12B on TTM basis, that produces an EBIT of ~$750mm. The company currently has net debt of $417mm and a market cap of  $1,764mm on a diluted basis. Thus, BBBY is selling for an EV/normalized EBIT basis of 2.9x. If we accept the normalized EBIT as a possibility, what multiple should a retailer sell for that has low growth prospects in their core category and declining free cash flow? EBIT/EV, or a pre-tax return on a BB rated bond (in normal times) is ~9-10%, which would imply an EV/EBIT multiple of 10x. Let's assume an 8x multiple. At an 8x multiple the company's equity would be worth ~$40/sh. I would say that there is a fairly large margin of safety here, no? I could be off on the normalized EBIT margin by 2% and there would still be the possibility of more than a double here at the current stock price. What do you say?",

"As a consumer I love Spotify, but there's a really BIG problem and it will come out in the wash.There's basically no differentiation - monthly sub, eat all you want. This leaves price, and before we've even got to decent profitability, there's a price war going on (added value incentives etc).Consumers are not all the same, and in music there are heavy and light consumers - pre streaming it was the classic 80/20 (near enough): 80% of recorded music consumed by 20% of buyers. That consumption desire has not changed, why would it? With capped supply costs for recorded,  far more spend now goes to live because there's all that unspent cash left to indulge the passion. We have an industry where supply will not let the consumer spend more than $10 / £10, whatever. Insane.The streaming model is as wrong as the old album model, where you had to buy the album for the 2 tracks you wanted. Now it's gone the opposite way: 'I don't care how much you engage, I refuse to charge you any more'.For all the streaming players, and Spotify is the best for its search, UI and depth of catalogue, this is going to get either painful or pointless.",
"I see improvement in the company, but when its Price/book ratio is almost 14x and its P/E is not even positive, I struggle to see why Spotify is a good buy.  Furthermore, I believe buy backs are only good when Price to book ratio is 1:1.  Therefore, I will wait to buy when this stock is significantly cheaper...if ever.  I like the companies model, but this buyback move does not benefit shareholders or the company.  Why would you ever commit to $1 billion in buy backs when your net income is currently negative???",

Spotify itself can't say when it will be profitable.Spotify does not just have one mega-wealthy competitor in Apple, but also faces direct competition in the two other mega-wealthy companies Amazon and Google. They are selling $10/month premium subscriptions very, very close to those of Apple and Pandora.

Trumps trade war does not help either as that scares people off with the threat of global growth slowdown, that might even have a bigger effect right now since it has the whole market on pins and needles.",
"This new well and field should allow TGA to double egyption production by the end of 2020.   On top of that, this is light oil, so the terrible differentials that TGA has to deal with for there eastern desert oil should be very much reduced.  All they need now is to the eqyptian military to give them access to their other western discover well, (~ 1400 bpd) for development, and they could actually end 2020 in the 30k bopd from egypt.   That would support a much higher price than now.The stock is entering what I consider to be bankruptcy pricing now, as anything oil is being severely punished, and anything Canadian oil even more so.   The funny thing is that Canadian production is a small part of their overall production, and you will notice they cancelled that one mile long exploratory well on their new Canadian lease.  This company is small, but nimble and good with there capital allocations.   Some perspective on current prices.   1.  The company's current market cap is 145 million, but they have roughly 50 million in cash, and over 30 million in entitlement oil still to be sold.   That means the market is vauing the company for about what they paid for there Canadian assets a few years ago (~60 million).  This means Egyptian production of over 12k bpd is a zero value.2.  The company has basically just been drilling to maintain current production rates for the last few years.  At that point you could at least argue that they deserved a lower, non growth multiple.  That is no longer true now there is a clear path to double or triple production over the next two years. I see an amazing opportunity here with current prices.  I am adding to my position of 26000 shares.",

This puts the share price, assuming little share dilution, at $960/share ($324,000,000,000 / 337,400,000 shares outstanding).Keep in mind the above assumes zero growth in market share of marijuana sales, and a much lower valuation multiple (P/S of 5); currently the P/S is about 88.

"So the timing is probably in between the Q1 call in the beginning of May and the end of Q2. As they were under IMMENSE pressure to fix things by the end of the quarter.

That's a lot of ""sunk capital"" that they can't piece together to make a product. They sounded much more confident by the time the Q2 results came around because they felt they had solved the issues and could legit ramp. And then they did just that into Q3.It might not have been as dire as ""we were going to die"" but I'm sure it felt like they were running out of options and that they were staring death in the face. Billions in inventory that they can't push as a completed product. So at most it should have been in the Q1 10q about the potential risks... But solving the ramp was always a risk.

You have supplies coming in at a build pace of 5k a week, but making cars at a pace of 1k a week.This is also the time things started to come out about them trying to renegotiate with suppliers and apparently upsetting a few of them along the way.If the issues really surfaced AFTER may 3rd that they still hadn't solved...

"I am sure that it is a true statement that if Tesla would have burned through another $1.5B in 9-10 weeks, it would have been bankrupt.BUT, the plan since April was to do whatever it takes to build AND sell more cars by June/July so they would NOT burn through so much cash.They knew the cash burn was going to be fatal (duh), but Tesla believed they can turn this around and not burn that cash and become profitable in Q3. They did it and they were right.If they were wrong they would have been TOAST for sure.Nothing surprising here AT ALL. Now they can laugh about it. I am sure they were biting their nails at that time, but could not say that they WILL fail, because the plan was to turn things around and win. All the while in broad daylight the vultures were circling and beating the death drums. (nothing seems more satisfying than beating on a dying man...apparently this is what America is becoming)NO OTHER COMPANY COULD HAVE PULLED THIS OFF. Now, that is tenacity and guts! (and luck too)",

"I’ve been critical of Musk but I think this makes sense. He was right in the middle of a massive ramp, had huge orders for product to be delivered so the cars could be produced, and production troubles. If they had massively screwed up production they never could have paid their bills. There would have been nowhere near the autos they needed to fill orders and the bills to suppliers would have been due. Obviously they had a minor example of this occur, but were able to produce a reasonable number of cars to avoid BK. Still wouldn’t touch it at $300 plus dollars with your money, not to mention mine.",
"It’s no surprise that Tesla would have gone broke if the model 3 was a failure with additional capital raise. It’s also no surprise that Elon and Tesla can raise capital or sell more stocks if they needed to. Now that Tesla is profitable, more and more shorts are covering and going long.",
"I count 11 unique questions, and only  2-3 “must answer” questions. Questions about he suppliers and Saudis are easily answered with simple logic: “why would he tell them?” Who else knew is moot. The SEC questions can be answered with research: “nope”. What’s left is “when?” and “why didn’t he tell investors?”",
"You guys sound like you're really on to something ... like Wile E. Coyote chasing the Roadrunner.  Ten questions would have been more poetic, but I suppose thirteen will do.  Maybe fund a special prosecutor through Kickstarter?",
It will get worst for Elon when demand starts to fall off the cliff in Q1’19.,
"Even stranger is that the stock is up on this news. This is basically an admission that the critics and shorts were right, or at least mostly right, and investors were misled on the health of the company. Yet they cheer this? Totally bizarre. The market cap should never have been where it was or is. One quarter is not going to fix all of this as well. If I was an investor I would be pretty upset. Yet it is applauded?",

"The ""long Engle"" agrees with @Trent Eady Bloomberg's 13-week trailing average acts as a mathematical dampening function QED. BTW, to *really* know what's going on, I could train a telescope with an infrared camera directly onto the production line exit door that I can see from my master bedroom window at ~650 feet above sea level. To count the vehicles coming out of Elon's amazing tent, I could train another set-up from one of my client's new Lennar Innovation properties that has a direct view of that. Of course, were I to do so, I would trade on the information myself and not post it here or anywhere else!!!",
"John writes: “Bloomberg’s Model 3 Tracker had the company producing 4,228 vehicles per week as of October 15... As of November 25, average production has barely increased. Bloomberg now shows Model 3 production having ticked up only slightly, to 4,406 per week”.However, on October 2, Bloomberg’s tracker changed the way it estimates the weekly production rate: “The most notable change is that we’re switching to a 13-week trailing average (rolling quarter) for our weekly estimates. Our tracker, by design, is focused on long-term accuracy over short-term forecasting. ...The weekly estimates have been far less reliable and subject to misinterpretation. The VIN datasets were simply too noisy to accurately forecast production for any given week. For example, our weekly estimates surged above 6,000 in August after Tesla registered a record number of VINs with U.S. safety regulators. Those estimates proved far too high after Tesla essentially halted new registrations by mid-August. Our model compensated with crashing weekly estimates in the second half of the quarter. We were wrong in both cases, but over the course of the quarter it evened out into an accurate forecast, just as it has in the past. By switching to a 13-week trailing estimate, we will eliminate some of the erratic swings that result from the imperfect datasets we have at our disposal. You’ll still be able to see on the weekly rate chart where our model is tracking, but we’ll be more focused on the trailing average to avoid reader confusion.”www.bloomberg.com/...So, according to Bloomberg, 1) its weekly estimates were so volatile and inaccurate they had to be smoothed out and 2) as a result of that smoothing, the model is now going to be very slow to react to any change in the weekly production rate. For instance, if the actual weekly production rate jumped up from 4,200 cars per week to 7,000 per week for 3 weeks, that jump would only nudge the 13-week trailing average to 4,850. A change in Bloomberg’s weekly estimates of a few hundred cars per week might just be noise in the model, or it might reflect a significant change in the production rate. It’s impossible to tell. So, it’s important to clarify that the Bloomberg estimate is a 13-week trailing average. As is, it is presented as an estimate of Tesla’s current weekly production, which is not the case.",
"NUMMI produced over 428,000 vehicles in that plant in 2006 with 5500 people, that's an average of more than 8200 per week sustained for the whole year (78 vehicles per employee). Tesla are managing 4200 per week with 10000 people (22 vehicles per employee). And Tesla are making a much simpler product.I'm not convinced that the ""alien dreadnought"", ""manufacturing revolution"", ""machine building the machine"", is working.",
"Any product manager in an industry must have this painful dance between product quality and speed of execution. Elon Musk is no different. My observation is that he has high-quality standards and really does not suffer that much in being late. He did so for good reasons last month, however, and now that the production is off the front burner, he will revert to his finicky design perfectionism with the model Y, the Semi, the production processes, and related machines. To cheer himself along the way, he will glance at the future models whose schedule is not yet firmly set. We all do that. The pain of slow execution is a cheap price to pay to satisfy our ambitious souls. As a retired chief-designer of snowmobiles in the seventies, I rejoice at the thousands of Facebook fans for what we produced, machines that are still in used to win races today, some selling at a high multiple of their original price. I would never want to relive the painful decisions made at the time, but I do get energy from my young and old admiring fans.  Like a host of others, I'm also a great fan of Elon Musk.  www.facebook.com/...",
"About a year ago I knew just about nothing about car manufacturing and now I'm part of one. I didn't realize how interlocked and complicated the process is. Everybody knows how difficult producing a new airplane is (we actually produced some parts for one), surprisingly the process of making cars is at the same level. After first going through the itemized list of the model 3 problems and later the more detailed one, I can tell we would've not made it, we would've been out of business. Our decision making would've not been fast enough and the problems way too massive. The production numbers I was getting from various sources were just about correct, but still all wrong, they were the peak production module rates which were meaningless. If one out of the 20 modules was shut down so were the others, sooner or later. By lining everything up it was possible to reach a high burst rate for one day that could've been extremely high. That was many months ago. Now the production is going much smoother, looks to me it's around 6000/wk and quite steady.What is absolutely stunning is that when Tesla added the four-wheel + performance models there was hardly any difference in the production rate even the car is much more complicated. There was the ""tent"", of course, that helped.It will be interesting to see what the production numbers will be at the end of this quarter. Tesla is upgrading some production equipment and getting ready to make the overseas versions which will add more production complexity. It will be even more difficult to guess how many cars they are making. At least the production process is now very well understood and in general, there is no reason to shut down the factory, upgrades can be made during the maintenance breaks.",
with a little luck the S-curve can turn into an N-curve,
"what matters most right now is Tesla’s ability to generate positive operating cash flow at a level to provide for ongoing CAPEX needs. I do not believe that is going to take a sustained production rate of 10,000 units/ week.If they can do that, the cash balance will only decline by the interest and debt principal payments required quarterly. That economic performance should support a stock price of at least $360/ share, which is the magic number  that will allow for the conversion of the maturing debt in the 1st qtr of 2019, into equity- thereby reducing the need to come up with principal cash at that time.The key is positive operating cash flow...",

"@John Engle Good article, John; and I agree with it.  Tesla showing a burst week is no longer impressive as well as obviously being unsustainable.  The Musk/Tesla magic has pretty much been used up.  As Tesla moves into the real mass market, with increasing percentages of customers being price and value conscious regular people who live within their sustainable budgets and competition growing in every price point, real sustainable production and sales will become more and more important to Tesla.  I also think investment multiples will move toward industry norms.

"The problem with using shareholders' equity IMO is that you may be double counting. Some of the assets that comprise SE are used to generate earnings - so either you count the earnings they generate or you count their asset value - not both. Subtracting net cash however is valid as the cash is liquid and does not generate any E. Well actually now that rates are above zero, it does generate some E typically. So to be totally accurate, you can subtract net cash from market cap (""P"") IF you also subtract after tax interest on that cash. You can also treat short term investments in the same way.",

For a company with the characteristics of Iconix to turn around, they must be run by outstanding management - which in my opinion Iconix currently has with CEO and President Bob Galvin,John McClain as Chief Financial Officer and of course with turnaround expert Peter Cuneo acting as the Executive Chairman.

"Just a short note today as I’m currently on a business trip in beautiful Vienna, Austria. What is the surest way to score life-changing wins with stocks? Here is my approach to stock long-term investing: From the time it went public in 1980 through 2012, Apple was a 225-bagger. A $10,000 investment in Apple turned into $2.25 million. But you had to suffer through two 80% !! declines and several 40% plus drops. Neflix was a 60-bagger from 2002 to 2014 and there was a four-month stretch where it fell 80%!!. Sometimes it is not the decline that will cause you to sell, but the sheer boredom of nothing happening! To enjoy really big, life-altering gains in the stock market, you have to learn that stock prices can diverge wildly from underlying business values. The two things that drive long-term success as an investor in stocks are TIME and QUALITY. I do recommend buying a great stock and forget about it. Do you think you would be able to hold on to your stock if you check the price on your computer screen every single day for the next 10 years? Those blinking prices on your computer screen are like little siren calls to action!!! There are times when your investment Soares and long stretches where nothing happens, or where your stock drifts lower. You might be tempted out of boredom to get something that seems to be moving. This is why I think you should not watch daily stock prices. Otherwise, you will surely get scared out of even the best stocks! Make sure you’ve got some quality stocks, and keep it for the long run. I am not sure of many things. But one thing I am sure of. I will not be selling any $ICON shares at these silly prices. LONG $ICON",

Both brands worth $600M while the whole portfolio is after another impairment charge with $363M in the books?Your 'valuation' is wishful thinking that is completely disconnected from reality. It's a distorted perception,  that let you recommend ICON all the way down from $6.6 to $0.20 (pre-split) as of today - still down a whooping 97% from your first recommendation as a 'strong buy'.Same like you I still think that the intangible assets are extremely undervalued, but not in the range of hundreds of millions. But I also agree now with @GR Value , that a brand is worth nothing if it is hands of an inept management. And the SP performance simply confirmed, that GR Value had it right with his recommendation to avoid this stock at seemingly 'cheap' levels above $1. If a company has resources and strategies to grow, then the company will hire staff. Iconix is now cutting down the workforce to the max. Good, if incompetent staff is sorted out. Nevertheless it's a very alarming signal, because they don't have the resources to hire good people. They also mentioned that there were 'unplanned' resignations and  that there is a high risk of a brain-drain, that may affect the business. @bob weinbrown I do understand your disappointment that I switched sides. Just to let you know: when Dave Jones was still in charge, he forwarded to me the ISSgovernance report as a response to my many questions and complaints with the SEC about the wrongly stated beneficial ownership of UBS and Radcliffe. Remember?The report lists more detailed the material weaknesses, that are already mentioned in  the annual reports since 2016. Already from that moment on it was clear that this position needs to be exited as soon as suitable.And in the latest 10-k it is mentioned, that these weaknesses still persisted throughout 2018. So I expect another SEC filing with a restatement of finances. From your private conversions you know, that I don't trade with 100 shares at a time. I mean at one point Cuneo was the only director, who still had more shares than me. Although I missed the short-lived run to $0.50, dumping the whole package at $0.355 was a good decision to get out with a relatively small loss. Meanwhile I found a way to short stocks in the US via CFDs - actually similar to what Mike Ashely did in 2017 & 2018 together with Monecor. So I am not watching on the sideline anymore and wait for good entry points to short. In this sense I hope that the dead cat bounces a bit more on Monday. Such a pity, that I will not get any 'Likes' anymore... Sniff, sniff.",

We can continue to pick up a lot of cheap $ICON shares right now. So let´s hang in there. I am very confident that my investment with $ICON will pay off eventually!

"Back to a market cap below $15M. Pity that I can't short ICON from here, knowing it has the potential to go down to $5M, especially since management erased all prospects for better earnings in 2019 and that there isn't a reorganization of the whole balance sheet in the making. Furthermore they cut costs for advertising and sponsoring - I mean, it was already bad and insufficient in pre-Galvin times. They were not even capable to maintain and manage their own websites properly. Probably their ""strategy"" includes, that the new wholesalers will do these efforts. Based on own experience with ordering stuff from LC it became quite clear, that their own licensees struggle to sell the products. After I complained that their UK licensee is dumping the stuff at half price of the LC official web shop and that I feel like ripped off, the UK licensee removed the stuff from their shop. www.sportsandsafety.com/... is blank.Btw .... 3 weeks after ordering the stuff is still not here. And only after several inquiries I finally got a confirmation from DHL that there is a parcel on the way. 3 weeks already, while other online shops don't need more than max 5 days. So much about the licensing deals, they signed.",
"I think a little patience will be rewarded here with $ICON! I just added more shares today at 1.66.

Also, we can expect significant new business in Japan & Korea. $ICON is down on low volume today, that's why I added more shares today.",

"Looks like the shorts are running for the hills, giving up and exiting the shares they shorted in their push to try to get the price below $2 on Friday. I said that when their effort failed, that the share price would probably go much higher. A few hours into the day today, many of them probably realized they were going to fail so they bailed out and bought shares to cover their shorts. Price is up 35%! So much for Stockhandler's fear-mongering claims that the stock had little chance of closing above $2 Friday and today; and that it would likely go below $1 in the next several days. Ahem. The price is $1.7 above $1.",
"Because there is a good chance that the shorts will mount another end of the day push to try to drive the share price below $2, I suggest that people who bought between $2.02 and $2.1 in the last minutes of Friday sell the same lots at $2.11 and higher during the day today in order to: 1) free up dry powder for you to use at the close if needed; and 2) take some profits, and then if the price drops down again at the close, make additional profits from that.What really matters is the closing price today. If you bought shares at $2.07 because you didn’t think they were worth buying at $2.15, then why not cash out at $2.15 or higher to take the profits and to give yourself some dry powder. If the price drops to $2.02 near the close, you’ll get them for about 6% to 10% lower.Even if you didn't buy any on Friday below $2.1, then you might consider selling a chunk today at prices that are higher than that for the same purposes.",

"@Sound Investment Of course I am opportunistic - meaning that I look for opportunities to make money.

Nevertheless I will follow ICON closely, also in case ICON will fulfill the $1.00 requirement. Most likely the next step will be then the issuance of 30-50M shares for fulfilling the market cap requirement and getting some working capital. SP will be diluted again, but at least they can operate another 210 days in penny stock territory.And they will announce this step before the cc, simply because they don't have any spectacular good news to announce. If they would have this kind of news, then they would have waited with the RS and looked for ways to maintain or increase momentum.",
"IMPORTANT: Everyone, we only need to finish above $15m market cap ($2 share price) today and Monday in order to clear the NASDAQ listing requirement for market cap. If we clear that, I think clearing the $1 requirement will be easy because the only thing that has the potential of dropping the price below $1 would be a pretty bad earnings call … and Iconix probably won’t hold their earnings call until after the 10 trading days above $1 are over and the risk is taken care of. That is common sense, but in addition, they usually give several days advance notice before an earnings call and they haven't specified a date yet, and that further means there probably won’t be a call between now and meeting the $1 requirement.If you weren't selling a decent portion of your shares at 55 cents ($5.5 current equivalent price) because you wanted to hold all of your shares for higher levels (such as $10 to $15), it means you likely should be buying more shares between $2 and $2.5 so that you can take some profits on some shares at a 100% gain when the price returns to $5. When the price is at $5, your upside is dramatically lower than when the price is $2. From $2, if the price goes to $20, your gain is 1,000%. From $5, if the price goes to $20, your gain is 400%. The downside from $5 is also greater than it is from $2. From $5 to $1.5 is a 70% drop and from $2 to $1.5 is a 25% drop. So a $2 share price is usually more deserving of a larger position, and a $5 share price is deserving of a smaller position. Keep in mind that when the price dipped temporarily below 10 cents a couple of months ago that: 1) it was during a huge pullback in the whole market, and  2) it was also during a time of lighter holiday trading volume, and 3) it was also during the last  weeks of the year when people were making moves for tax reasons including harvesting tax losses. None of those 3 factors exist now. In addition, there are lots of people including me who wished we had bought  a lot more shares when the price was below 15 cents ($1.5 equivalent now), so if the price does happen to dip to $1.5, I think there will be plenty of buying at that level and huge buying if it gets to $1.0. Once the $1 requirement is cleared, we will probably see a sizable increase in the share price for two reason: 1) the risk and uncertainty of de-listing is removed. 2) the momentum traders will ride the price in the opposite direction upwards again. The down movement 2 days ago came from the RS news, but the momentum traders instantly jumped on board with it and have been riding it down. The short sellers have jumped on board in hopes of breaking the $2 mark. If they fail, they will bail and their buying shares to cover will cause a price increase in and of itself. But also long investors will be encouraged and help to send the price up. The momo traders will jump on board and you could see a 100% gain in a matter of days or weeks. Or you could simply exit at 20% higher or 50% higher for a great short-term gain. There will most likely be a gap of at least a few days between clearing the NASDAQ requirement and the day of the earnings call, and in those days, the price has an extremely high likelihood of going up at least 10% to 20% on the very good news of satisfying the NASDAQ requirement. If you really think the next earnings call is going to be bad, then you could just sell the extra shares you bought for a gain.The last 2 minutes of trading today is important. If the longs make a push in the last 2 minutes, they can push or keep the price above $2.  And then we only have 1 more day to go. So I strongly recommend that people have buy orders ready to go at $2.05 at the end of today both so that you can get a nice 20% to 100% gain on those buys, but also in order to protect your main investment.Even if the price is at $2.2 with 2 minutes left, I strongly recommend putting limit orders in at about $2.05 because it’s very probable that a few shorts will place orders at $1.95 in the last 15 seconds. Likewise, even if the price is at $1.9 with 3 minutes left, then I strongly recommend placing orders to buy at $2.05 in the last 15 seconds. I think some smart longs will already be doing that, so whatever amounts you add to the mix could well be enough to tip the battle in the longs favor. It’s whatever the price ends at in the last second that counts.",

"I don’t think doing the RS means the next earnings call will be bad. With the share price at 38 cents and only two months remaining before the NASDAQ requirement must be met, they might well have decided to get it done with in order to remove the uncertainty and the risk. Even if the earnings call was going to be good enough to send the stock price up 100%, that still would not have been nearly enough to meet the NASDAQ requirement. If I were running the company, I would do the RS now and eliminate the risk and uncertainty. When that risk and uncertainty is taken off the table, it has a good chance of helping the share price.Even if I had a great conference call in the works that I thought would send the stock price up another 150% higher, that would only get it to 95 cents and then I’d be taking a big risk that the stock doesn’t have 10 days in a row above $1, especially if the whole market has a pullback. Even if it does stay above $1 for the 10 days, you’re still in a situation in which you don’t have any of the 4 benefits I described earlier. In addition, once the stock reached the 70 cent mark, it would be a 1,000% gain in 2-3 months, and it probably would have hit a good amount of profit taking; with additional profit taking every 10 cents higher it went.It is possible that there could be a subpar conference call, but that possibility has been there all along. Stockhandler, it sounds like you probably ended up being able to short the stock as you had wanted to. That’s a super dangerous game to play as you could easily get a 200% loss at these price levels (around 26 cents). I think the RS could mean that we’re not going to get outrageously great news during the EC that would have been certain to send the stock up another 300% from 40 cents to $1.2, and would mean a 1,500% gain from a couple of months ago. But I wasn’t expecting that level of great news and I doubt that more than the few most uber bullish people were expecting that amount of gain in 3 months. Outside of that, I don’t think we can say that a RS means a bad conference call - and a couple of anecdotal stories do not bolster the case for that.They might have a good EC in the works, they might have an average one (that is neutral for the share price for now), they might have a subpar one and they might have a very good one or a great one.

I'm glad I stuck with my strategy of selling in tranches on the way up to take a chunk of profits to give me dry powder to buy more on the way down.If you didn't sell any shares when the price was above 45 cents, it could well mean you should be buying more shares at these prices so that you'll be fine on selling some on a 80% to 100% gain, and still have plenty of shares to hold for higher levels. The other benefit is that you often end up making some money/profits off the volatility and are much less emotionally affected by the pullbacks (because you're in essence making money from it and being able to buy shares at lower prices that you recently sold for higher prices).Overall, I'm very glad they are doing the RS because it means that: 1) more institutions will be able to buy the stock. A sizable percentage of institutions have rules against owning stocks that are below various levels. For some, the cut-off is $1, for others it's between $2 and $4. Now, some will be able to buy right away and others will be able to buy relatively soon (and far, far faster than if they didn't do the RS).2) It means more investors will be able to own ICON using margin. No brokerages will give margin to stocks under $1, and few will do it if it's under $2. And even when it's between $3 and $5, they often give much less margin. Even if you don't buy on margin, it means that others will be able to, and will be able to buy double or triple what they could before.",

I find it ironic that ICON is  my only holding  in the last two weeks that has actually increased in price.,
"Now ICON is in a range, where announcing a reverse split of 1:5 to 1:7 makes sense. Markets don't like RS, shorts do and often SP drops 20-30% . Even if it would drop 30%, then ICON will be still above $15M market cap. That's why I am cautious and sold out above $0.35. Until the reverse split is done, ICON isn't a longterm investment anymore. But it is a good swing trade option and will be traded on dips. Nevertheless I still regard ICON as highly undervalued and will consider it as a longterm investment again after the RS and/or CC.",

"I haven’t read all the comments from the last 1-2 days. I figure maybe someone has already mentioned that this is a golden opportunity for the stock to have 10 days above 20 cents (above $15m market cap) in order to meet the NASDAQ requirement, which would mean a significant uncertainty is removed from the stock. I think it might make sense for some people here (not all people) to take some profits at levels above 27 cents for two reasons: 1) The first is because if you’ve got a gain of 100% to 200%, it’s often wise to take at least a chunk off the table. Related, my thinking is that a person should generally have more on the table when a stock is very dramatically undervalued, and then less on the table after it’s 100% to 200% higher and less dramatically overvalued. If you’re not selling a chunk at 100% to 200% up, then you should likely should have been buying more shares when it was a lot lower. 2) Taking some profits at above 27 cents allows people to provide support if the price re-approaches 20 cents in the next 6-7 trading days. There is a fair chance that if the price goes below 25 cents, some short sellers will make a push to drive it below 20 cents. They may well even lead the push towards 25 cents. If there are people with dry powder available from taking some profits, they can probably help repel the short push. If it drops lower, you’ve essentially made some money by getting the same number of shares for 10% to 20% less, maybe even 30% less.Of course, that approach is not the best for everyone. But it seems to me that for many people it’s a win win. While that might make it mildly less likely that the stock pushes above 35 cents in the next week, the fact is that some people are going to take some profits in the range of 27 to 33 cents, so I’d far rather it be people who will buy the shares back again if the price drops a bunch. 1/4 of the people who are taking profits might not buy at all on pullbacks in the next week (if they’re busy or are focused on other stocks) and another 1/4 might wait until it’s below the $15m market cap before they buy.So given that some profit taking is going to take place, and a decent likelihood that the shorts will make a push to try to break the 10-days in a row (in which case there is probably money to made on buying on the pullback), I'd far prefer people on here be taking a portion of profits than random people doing so. Of course everyone should do whatever they think is best.",
"@bob weinbrown  Interesting but kind of ""far-fetched""  idea....Re-invent Mossimo......Made in Italy label..Italian company and Italian design...Upper scale for Macy's Nordstrom etc......Directly competing with PVH's brands....+ wider distribution internationally....Italian flag label!

"Over the many years of investing I made the same mistake time and time again.Just as a stock made break-even and then a little bit of profit, I would sell the stock.For years on end I never made any significant profit in the share market.My father and I sat through the crash of 2008 and basically watched all his investments evaporate.But before he died he said to me, ""why don't you just buy the shares and hang on to them"".So many longs will see a small profit. They might make a 2 bagger on Iconix and then they will sell.There is every possibility that under Mr Galvin and Mr Cuneo the share price could recapture a level of $10 or $20 in years to come.But to share in those gains you have to have the fortitude to hold the shares even though you may have only paid a few cents for them.",

"I think Target is now carrying adult men's and women's Umbro in their stores. When they first said they were starting to do adult Umbro, they said it would only be online and in fact it was only online. Tonight I just viewed the feature on their website where you can click on products and find out if it's In Stock in the nearby stores and for the four adult products I checked, they all were in stores. Here's a screenshot of one: www.dropbox.com/...FYI for most clothing items, Target only stocks 1 or 2 items per size and per color in stores, and quickly replenishes them from their regional warehouses a few days after a size or color sells. So when it shows most stores have 1 or 2 in stock, it's 1 or 2 per size and color, which is fairly normal for them. So if there are 2 colors and 5 sizes, there are about 12 of that item on a waterfall wall rack.I know this because when I find a shirt, shorts or pair of pants that I really like, I normally buy several of it so that even when some get ripped or stained over time, I still have a few. During the last ten years, I've done this at Target with about one product per year, and it usually takes me a few trips to the store to get the amount I want. Or I have to shift online to get the amount. Many times I've had the store clerk check nearby stores and they usually have 1 or 2 of my size/color in stock. Luckily there is a Target 5 minutes away and it's on my route to other things, so it's no effort to go by there. Plus I get some of my sundries there.Anyway, this most likely means Target was happy with the response to the online Adult clothing items, and is now moving even more strongly towards Umbro. Not only are they doing them in stores now, but they've expanded the product selection for adults to include things like this Women's Activewear Dress (for the soccer Moms) - www.target.com/... The website says ""New at Target."" They now have 138 Umbro products and 39 of them say ""New at Target"" and 11 of the 39 new items are Women's. In total, there are 29 Men's products and 21 Women's products and 50 adult products.That's well more than double the amount the last time I checked. Here are the Women's ones: www.target.com/... Expanding significantly into major new categories (Men's and Women's) in stores at a very large chain like Target is as important as placing a new brand into a large chain like Target.",
"Great point Butler that the price was well above $1 not that long ago, and not much has changed since then, and now with all of the various positive news in the recent weeks, if anything, things are better. And it was over $1.6 last winter.Huge amount of volume on yesterday’s 76% gain. Usually a short squeeze only happens on some piece of news to trigger it. But when a company is as undervalued as Iconix is, then big short squeezes can happen on no news. Many people have said that this stock could jump over 40% in a day on even moderately good news, and now it just dumped 75% on no announced news at all. And it did it with massive volume, so it was not a case of a price move on a very low volume day.There might potentially be some profit taking that moves it down 10%, but that’s fine because the important thing is higher lows and higher highs overall is what creates strong technicals and momentum, and that’s been happening strongly the last several weeks.As a few people noted, it could be that the 76% jump means there is some major news on the near-term horizon. If so, it may potentially take several days before the news is announced. For example, if a large new partnership agreement has been made, but they need to wait a while to get a few things in place before announcing it. A third possibility is that a sizable investor has assessed the company, decided it’s worth a lot more than 35 cents per share and just took out a sizable position. Some large investors don’t diddle around on price when getting a position in a company that’s heavily undervalued. E.g. If the investor thinks the stock is worth $1.2 per share, then they might not care whether they’re paying 22 cents or 35 cents.I’ve taken a little flack for saying that this stock has potential for a 200% gain. FWIW, today at 35 cents the stock hit a 500% increase in less than three months. The interesting thing is that it’s within reason to have another 500% increase in the next 12-18 months. That’s not my baseline scenario, but it’s doable. A refi combined with placing Mossimo and Danskin in sizable chains may be enough to do it. There are other paths to getting there in which only one of those two big brands is placed, but OP is also placed in a sizable chain plus Starter or Umbro gain additional steam. But even without a combo of major placements, the share price could be 200% to 300% higher than now with a refi plus one major placement, or 2 to 3 medium sized things.Based on the last week, it could well be that Andhurst is right and that they've been stacking up good news in order to release it during the course of a few week period to crank the share price very high. In roughly the last couple of weeks:* The major partner for Royal Velvet going into wholesale plus expanding into far more categories.* The Soccer Shots partnership with 350,000 children buying Umbro shirts annually. Besides the income from shirts, it increases the chances that those 350,000 kids and their siblings buy other Umbro stuff at Target, and that some of their classmates who see the shirt buy some Umbro, and to a lesser degree, some of the parents buy some adult apparel at other stores.* Pony being placed at the Foot Locker and Champs chains* The announcement of McClain as the permanent new CFO* London Fog collaboration* The news shared by SI of Umbro getting into a new international retail chain that has not been announced by the Iconix yet. They are not only a large chain, but also a very fashionable/hip chain so it’s great for Umbro's reputation. And the Umbro collection is fairly large as you can see in this link. The plad patterns are popular now. I personally don't like it when the top and bottom are both the same pattern, though that’s what hip youngsters are doing overseas now. I do like the patterns when combined with a solid. And I like most of their other designs - www.pullandbear.com/...ón-c1030189505.html* At some point, there will probably be some kind of news about Danskin, Mossimo and OP.Congrats to everyone who added shares during the last few months!",

Would not be shocked if it plunged tomorrow but that's probably just reflex after these past months/years. Could also continue to ride up if more momentum traders jump in.,
This is crazy! Of course I thought the same thing as the price declined on an almost daily basis the last months on little to no news. Now thinking the same on the increase. Maybe it's just starting to normalize back to where it should have been all along...,
Wow.,
"Maybe I'm mistaken but I think the news on Friday, announcing the new CFO may have provided new optics on refinancing.",
"Possible short covering explaining the volume here (?).Traders still in control, but if this holds we might actually see some new long money flows to help support the share price.Speaking of technicals, the share price this morning blew right through the 120- and 150-day moving averages. If we can close around $0.27 today, we’ll be within $0.07 of the 200-day. That is kind of a “big deal” to a lot of chartists, especially if it holds.",

"I haven't been on here in several days. I agree with nearly all of the comments people posted about the news of the Royal Velvet partnership - iconixbrand.com/...I think it’s bigger news than it probably looks like for a few reasons. They are one of the 4 largest global players in the sector that Royal Velvet is in. If you skim through their annual report, you will see info and photos that show the huge scale of their company, that include some massive state of the art automated facilities, and rights to some major brands including Calvin Klein Home, which is the 2nd largest luxury bedding brand in the U.S. -himatsingka.com/...They are a high-growth company, and their revenues from brands grew by 46% in the last year. One strength of their’s is that they have a database of more than 25,000 designs - himatsingka.com/... and the designs are already connected to their weaving machines. They can tap into the designs in the database that have sold well in similar countries like the UK and Australia, and they can easily adjust existing designs.They have huge capacity automated manufacturing facilities that allow them to make their wholesale prices appealing to retail chains. This increases initial wholesale orders and also increases re-orders because the retailers can sell them at good price points which increases sales - himatsingka.com/...They also already have a full-blown high-capacity warehouse and distribution system in the U.S. - “DWI is equipped with state-of-the-art warehousing and supply chain capabilities to ensure the highest standards of service for its customers.”  himatsingka.com/...A related strength is that they are expanding Royal Velvet into a much larger number of categories and product types: “Under the new licensing agreement, Himatsingka will design, manufacture and distribute Royal Velvet across multiple home textile categories including fashion bedding, sheets, utility bedding including down and down alternative pillows, mattress pads and protectors, blankets and throws, bath and beach towels, bath accessories, bath rugs, shower curtains, pet beds and pet throws.I think that’s roughly quadruple the product types that Royal Velvet has been in the last several years. Himagsingka is able to do this because they already make all of those things with quality at competitive pricing. It seems evident that they realize that Royal Velvet is a strong brand name that can be much more heavily tapped into by being in more stores and in more categories. If they had only mild partial interest in the Royal Velvet brand, they would not be doing the large number of categories above. The 10% jump in Himagsingka’s share price on the Royal Velvet news further  indicates that they are going full tilt on the brand. They probably will position Royal Velvet as a nice quality but affordable line that is less expensive than Calvin Klein. Royal Velvet gives them a strong brand to tap into a different set of customers and stores than Calvin Klein, and significantly boost their company’s already strong sales.On top of that, they have plenty of money to put into the wholesaling of the brand: trade shows, sales reps, product design, product packaging, etc. So in multiple ways, this is a perfect partner for Iconix to choose for expanding Royal Velvet.",

This singer provided an opportunity for kids from local schools to perform onstage.Of course many parents bought tickets to the concert to watch the kids perform.Lets's consider San Diego Fleet.These are some of the collegiate facilities in the region; San Diego State University, University of California San Diego, University of San Diego, San Diego City College, San Diego Mesa College, Ashford University, San Diego Community College, etc.AAF San Diego Fleet could say to each college in turn, we will give your collegiate cheer team the opportunity to perform a cheer for the Fleet team.That is an opportunity that the students would never forget in their life times.They would forgo one college cheer commitment to perform for the AAF San Diego Fleet Team.What this also does is that it motivates parents and friends of the cheer team to go along to the game and buy tickets.Now if you said to the collegiate football teams, look you can have an exhibition match for say 45 minutes as a prelude to the Fleet game. This would draw thousands of spectators from the colleges whose teams were participating in the exhibition games.Young football players who never go on to the NFL would remember these events all their lives.These exhibition games would provide massive promotion of the AAF football league and in my opinion increase it's chances of survival.",

How much would it cost to sponsor a tour by the New York Ballet company where Danskin dance ware is prominently displayed?Perhaps Miss Tatum could be a prominent actor in such a tour.So much more exposure than just releasing a new dance capsule.Bringing art and culture to the 51 States and inspiring the imaginations of young dancers both male and female and thrusting Danskin back into the public's consciousness.,
"It's great to see Umbro and Starter being very proactive in the marketplace. Hopefully this will bring these brands back into the public's consciousness and lead to licencing opportunities.I'd love to see Danskin take a similar approach.Brands such as London Fog, Lee Cooper and Mossimo are generic clothing brands.Danskin is a brand associated with female femininity and with dance and theatre. They provide many dance related item's for girls and for women.Could you imagine Danskin sponsoring a ballet tour of the United States in order to thrust Danskin squarely back into the public's imagination.Kirov Ballet, Bolshoi Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet, Royal ballet, New York City Ballet.Such a sponsored tour is well within Iconix's capabilities under Mr Cuneo and Mr Galvin.Whereas Soccer is important for soccer fans and football is important to grid iron fans, what will spark the imagination of young girls especially those that participate in ballet and all forms of dance?Umbro spends tens of millions sponsoring soccer teams. Sponsoring the national tour of a ballet company should be well within Danskin's reaches.This should pay dividends in sales and licensing opportunities. Who knows, you could even have some merchandising opportunities and toy sales through such activities.Gym clothing would be another great avenue for Danskin to persue. Perhaps partnering with some sort of fitness guru and perhaps a television fitness show sponsored by Danskin and featuring Danskin clothing. Well within the reaches of Iconix.",

"I have gone back and looked at Iconix’s filings to find info on the NASDAQ listing deficiencies notice and possible cures. It had been a while since I read those, and I managed to get some of the conditions twisted around in my own mind, to a degree.For (hopefully) some clarity, I am posting an excerpt from the original Iconix filing on the matter hereinbelow. I don't recall seeing subsequent updates filed by Iconix but I may have missed them.Since Iconix is still listed with NASDAQ, one must assume they met conditions for, applied for, and were granted an additional 180 day extension from November 26, 2018 to cure the minimum $1.00 closing price required for ten consecutive days. This means the condition must be cured by around May 25th. The company would still have the ability to appeal a delisting determination even after May 25th, but one would have to think a reverse split will have been implemented by then if it proves necessary, which looks likely of course:“Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.On May 29, 2018, Iconix Brand Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market notifying the Company that the minimum bid price per share for its common stock fell below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days (from April 16, 2018 to May 25, 2018) and that therefore the Company did not meet the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).The letter also states that pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company will be provided 180 calendar days, or until November 26, 2018, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In accordance with Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company can regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, if, at any time during such 180-day period, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum period of 10 consecutive business days. If by November 26, 2018, the Company cannot demonstrate compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth under Rule 5550(a)(2), the Company may be afforded a second 180 calendar day grace period. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirements set forth under Rule 5550(a)(2). In addition, the Company would be required to notify Nasdaq of its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.If the Company does not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period(s), including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company’s shares of common stock will be subject to delisting. At such time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel.The Company intends to monitor its closing bid price for its common stock between now and November 26, 2018, and will consider available options to resolve the Company’s noncompliance with the minimum bid price requirement, as may be necessary. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria.”",

"The $250 million investment in the AAF league by the NHL owner was not a bailout. This article below has details, and I think Ebersol is telling the truth because if someone wanted to do a bail-out, he would have put $40 million in and not a whopping $250 million. $250 million is enough to pay for the salaries of 100% of the players for the next 7 1/2 years. 400 players times $80,000 per player per year is $32m. The league also has money coming in from ticket sales, merch sales, TV contracts and a portion of concessions. $250 million is far, far more than would be needed for a bailout. A bailout would be: I'll put in $40 million -enough to cover this season so I can see how well the league does and then I'll think about maybe more. $250 million is definitely a major investment. The league now has enough money to survive for a few years even if the rest of this season doesn't go well. And they now have an incredibly deep-pocketed billionaire who is heavily invested and who has very good pro sports ownership knowledge and experience. He will go to significant lengths to make sure his investment is successful. That $250 million will be used towards increased marketing, possibly expansion to San Jose (or Sacramento) and Carolina, and possibly increasing player salaries next year for key positions like QB and RB. I wouldn't be surprised if the billionaire puts several million into Iconix with the Starter connection. Clip from the article (and he's right about how start-ups usually raise money in multiple rounds):Ebersol said, “We are a start-up, and start-ups usually raise money in pieces — there’s a Series A piece, Series B, Series C, etc. After the success of the first week, we had a number of investors come to us and offer us all kinds of different investments. Tom Dundon showed up and said, ‘Do you want to continue to raise Series B, Series C and Series D or do you want to raise Series Infinity right now and be taken care of from now on.’ That was an offer I was not going to refuse.”“If I was going to describe to you my dream investor, I would have told you a 47-year-old football fan who has professional sports ownership experience and is self-made — a man who went from zero to billions of dollars completely on his own work. That describes Tom Dundon. In my wildest dreams, I didn’t think we would be able to get someone like Tom Dundon to come in the way he did.”And the article is right that whether or not the league was actually in a cash crunch, $250 million is a huge investment -www.orlandosentinel.com/...Also covered by Yahoo Sports: sports.yahoo.com/...",

"I just watched a clip on CNBC saying that they are making solar panels compulsory in California for new homes.Clearly you have some very cleaver engineer's :)I found with my camper installation that the production of energy dramatically increases when the panels are clean. Actually I read instructions for optimizing panel energy production.This suggests that there will be a window for solar panel cleaning businesses to startup. For example using a crain or a similar device to clean the panels on a two story building.A clever entrepreneur could clean all the panels on a street in an afternoon charging a good fee for the cleaning service. Energy production also increases when the panels are cool and falls off when they are hot.I noticed on the installations on CNBC that the panels are installed on dark colored roofs. Dark roofs are much hotter than roofs made of a lite color. You can also mount the panels on standoffs to allow air under the panels to cool them.If California are going to make solar installations compulsory, then I would suggest that they have engineers consider a set of installation standards that maximize energy production.Even on a dark roof you could use a lite colored material say within 400 mm's of the panels thereby reducing the temperature of the panels and maximizing energy production.The installations that I saw did not appear to be optimized for energy production but I guess sometimes appearance is more important than function.A clever engineer could setup a test installation and thereby develop standards for an optimal installation. Optimal standoff height, optimal area around panels coated in lite coloured material, optimal cleaning period.Most campervans and motorhomes are white I believe too reduce the temperature within the vehicles. Mounting panels on a white area of roofing will help reduce the temperature of the panels and increase energy production.",

"For people who have been wondering if Starter/Iconix had Starter merchandise sales set up at the games, the answer is yes. At least at the San Antonio game as this TV news report by a San Antonio TV station shows shows. The reports says the fan support was enthusiastic, and that many fans had already bought the team jackets, jerseys and sweatshirts. At around the 30 second mark, you can see a merchandise kiosk in the background with various merch raised up on display, plus at least one clothing rack of jerseys near it. Again at 37 second mark and the 44 second mark you can see a merchandise area behind the fans being interviewed. The crowd during the game is pretty pumped up and loud - www.ksat.com/...This article in an Arizona daily newspaper also says that some fans were already wearing team apparel at the game - www.azcentral.com/...Quotes: Some of the folks attending were passionate, however, and were already wearing Hotshots apparel. This requires some gumption since the predominant team colors are yellow and green. But they are just different enough to catch on.The AAF’s hope is that the league catches on this month, and crowds will grow. That’s possible because the actual playing of football was entertaining. Of the 52 players on the Hotshots roster, 49 have at least signed an NFL contract before, so the quality of football was better than an average preseason game.The Hotshots could catch on as fans see more of them. Wolford for instance, threw four touchdown passes and looked better than many quarterbacks who play in the NFL preseason.Judging by its first weekend, the AAF has a chance because it’s respectful of the game but also willing to innovate.The Hotshots, and the AAF, have clearly put in the required work. If Week 1 was an indication, the league might have found a home in the spring, and in Arizona.",

And I am more interested in their bonus points programs for players to earn and to grow with the league. Their working-class status with much smaller paychecks Vs NFL players get should help our Starters brands to engage more with true football fans and players who most don't have super talents in playing at elite NFL levels at all but diehard football crazy. They can be related more closely and directly. Hope AAF players become true community-based fan ambassadors and favorite regular sports guys who happen to be playing on TV. Not those hard to reach multi-millionaires.  And that will generate more brand awareness, uniforms sales.Hope this also caught Jay-Z's attention to get involved early with Starters and Carl Banks. He sold those Roc baseball hats and made good money but got sued. That doesn't sit well for his images even if he could get away from the arbitration.  If by the end of the season and the AAF gets enough attention especially keep the fanbases engaged heavily then we shall see more moves on the business partnerships and merchandise sides. Financial institutions are sure interested to see our Iconix brand at work. Keep fingers crossed.",
Well done @Upside Research for your review about the first football game of the AAF league. All we need now is a little good news from $ICON and we are off to the races!!!,
"I watched a lot of the first football game of the AAF tonight while eating dinner and doing some housework. A good thing for Iconix is that the uniforms are nice looking and the Starter logos are very, very prominent on the uniforms. The Starter logos are in more than one spot, and are large enough that there are pretty prominent in about 30% of the camera shots and visible in another 20% of the shots. The logo is:-- on the sides of both shoulders on the upper bicep facing sideways towards the cameras so most of the time when the camera focuses on either several players or on one player, the logo is pretty large on the screen. -- on the front of the pants, it’s also fairly large, so you can see it in various camera shots such as when the camera has a close-up of a player walking on or off the fields, and when the camera is facing the QB during the snap.-- on the pants and the hats of the refs-- on the gloves that players wear, the logo is super large-- on the shirts, sweatshirts and jackets that the sideline coaches and staff are wearing.The league might not get large numbers of viewers, but for the people who do view one or more of the games, Starter will be quite visible to them numerous times throughout the game, and the logos look quite nice on the uniforms.While it’s hard to create a new football league that lasts and it remains to be seen if this one will, they are doing a lot of things right including:* High quality coaches: Steve Spurrier of Orlando is a very strong coach; and he coached a great game against Atlanta. Coaching makes a big difference, so it’s smart for the league to focus on this.* The camera work, commentary and interviews by CBS were high quality.* Adding extra features that the NFL doesn’t offer such as putting mics on more of the players and coaches. And letting us listen in on the deliberations of the replay ref - that adds an element of suspense and engagement to the replay rulings. I also like that only 2 point conversions are allowed after TDs (no extra points which are boring).* Much faster pace of the game. The shorter game clock keeps things moving, as does not having TV time-outs. * I think they’re also smart being mostly in large cities that don’t have an NFL team. These will be more likely to embrace an AAF team. They’re also smart in being in hotbeds of college football where a lot of fans already have high respect for the talents of graduating college players. They designed the league so that each team has the rights to players who attended the five universities closest to them. So almost all eight teams have players that the fans in the area already know and respect. For example, the Orlando team has the rights to the University of Florida, Florida State etc., and the Salt Lake team has Utah, Utah State and BYU among their schools. I live in Florida and a large percentage of the people who grew up here are serious fans of one the Florida college teams; and many are big football fans in general. There is a decent chance that fans of those schools will over time become fans of the affiliated AAF team so they can see some of their favorite players play after they graduate. For example, I went to Georgetown and only a fraction of the players make it in the NBA, but I’d like to see the higher quality non-NBA guys play after graduation. If 3 of them were on the same D-league team of the NBA, I’d watch it on TV or in person if I was nearby … because I could see 3 of them at the same time. That said, Orlando has the highest percentage of non-native Floridians, so it might be that a lot of the Orlando team’s fans watch on TV and are too far away to go to games. But in most of the other cities, I don’t think there are a high number of transplants.* Good quality players on the whole. I was skeptical about this, and was pleasantly surprised. I think the players were better than your average top 40 college football game. While the Atlanta team was only so-so in the first game, the Orlando offense looks better that many NFL offenses and their defense was also very good. Their QB was excellent and I bet he will be in the NFL within a year or so. Their RB was really good, and their WRs made some very nice catches, including one that was truly great. Check out the highlights of the Orlando game at this link below - they’re as good as many NFL games. Note that on your computer screen, the logos are going to be a lot smaller than on a TV, even if you click to Full Screen view in YouTube. Also, the highlights are mostly of panoramic shots where the logos are smaller, and the highlights are not of the close-up shots of the players after the plays which often run for several seconds after each play, and the replays which are usually close-ups, the huddles, the close-up sideline shots etc that make up the majority of the air time. So you’re mostly not going to see what I mean, but you’ll see a few spots of it. Check out the 15 second mark where the Atlanta coach walks on the field wearing a Starter jacket, and the 55 second mark where they show the players after the field goal. After most plays in the game, you see the Starter logos just as prominently. I recommend watching part of a game to see how large the logos look on a TV: www.youtube.com/...The highlights of the San Antonio-San Diego game are here:www.youtube.com/...* I think they’re smart in not trying to pitch themselves as a competitor to the NFL; and smart to avoid pretending that they are going to have the same tier of players. They’re pitching themselves as very good quality football in the off-season that isn’t at the same level as the NFL, but is still very good quality and enjoyable for football fans to watch in the off-season. The quality is as good as college football, and plenty of fans watch college games during the NFL season even when they have better quality players they can watch. The main difference is college has a more passionate fan base at the games than the AAF has due to students and alumni. But the majority of the people who watch college games on national TV didn’t go to school or live in the states of the teams they’re watching. They like watching good quality football. One weakness of past alternative pro football leagues has been the quality of football. It seems the AAF has addressed this, which could help it do well.",

"The new CFO McClain was CFO of the Jones Apparel Group in New York City for 7 years from 2007 to 2014. They owned or licensed a bunch of brands, so he has plenty of experience with the apparel industry and also with licensing: a lot more experience in those areas than David Jones had. Near the start of his time there, they sold the luxury store chain Barneys New York to a Dubai investor group for $940 million and towards the end of his time there, the entire company was sold to Sycamore Partners for $2.2 billion. So he also has experience with sales of part of a company and a whole company. The Jones Apparel Group is now called Nine West Holdings - us.fashionnetwork.com/...en.wikipedia.org/...Before that he was VP and Chief Accounting Officer at Sirius Radio, Chief Accounting Officer at Avis/Budget Group (which owns Avis, Budget, Payless and other companies), Audit Manager at Arthur Andersen, and COO at Cendant Finance Holding, plus other jobs - quotes.wsj.com/...I like it when a CFO has had operational roles such as being COO of a company. Also, he is on the board of Lands End and a couple of other companies. Some of you may be happy to hear that he was in charge of Investor Relations at the Jones Apparel Group while he was the CFO so he has experience in that area, which of course is needed at Iconix now. So that may end up being a good aspect of this hire. But I think his high levels of experience, particularly his experience in apparel and licensing, is the most important part.",

Hi ButlerYes I remembered that you were from the former East Germany. I am lying in my campervan in Rotorua with my son. I liked watching those Natioal Geographic series called Doomsday Preppers. So I am practicing by bugging out. Well I'm really just camping. It's 11 PM and I have one of those citronella lanterns burning at the back of the camper. I spent quite a bit of time upgrading the camper. Have a 150w solar panel on the roof. I ripped out the 3 way fridge and installed a 12v compressor fridge to run from the deep cycle batteries.What a luxury to have a fridge that runs perpetually from the solar panel and batteries.Our fridge is full of delicacies. Much better than living of spaghetti and meatballs and other canned foods.I had noticed the new Iconix deal with G3.,

Here's a screen shot of it - www.dropbox.com/... Two days after the Huf Starter line was released and was for sale on the Huf websites, they weren't available on the PacSun website so it was unclear if PacSun would carry the items.If PacSun is also carrying them in its stores, that would be great because they have 630 stores in the U.S. It think they likely are because on the New Arrivals page, the Starter items occupy spots 7 through 16 and the probably wouldn't emphasize them so prominently there is people couldn't get them at stores - www.pacsun.com/...A good thing about Huf and PacSun is that the prices on these items mean that it doesn't take a large number of items sold to generate sizable revenues.

"I think this is accurate:Jay-Z Stalling With Arbiter Diversity Push: Rocawear Ownerwww.law.com/...www.law360.com/... Iconix, however, referenced her comments from the bench, in which she suggested the argument that arbitration was a “public accommodation” subject to prohibitions on discriminatory practices was an “incredible stretch.”“If people are dissatisfied with the diversity of AAA, don’t put the AAA panel in your agreement,” Justice Saliann Scarpulla said from the bench, according to the Iconix filing. “Go somewhere else. Do something that makes a difference.”THIS IS TRUE:Putting the issue of that precedent aside, Iconix is asserting that signatories to an arbitration agreement are aware they may have traded away certain protections and rights in exchange for the expediency and privacy of the arbitration process.---... I don't like putting in arb clauses for that reason. But if I put in an arb clause, then I have to be willing to go to arb rather than other avenues such as court.... JayZ is kind of ridiculous with legal things. This reminds me of Jay-Z's absurd response to the SEC requiring him to talk to them: ""The attorney also questioned the intent behind the SEC’s demands and argued that the upshot has turned “into a celebrity hunt.” Jay-Z opposes the SEC’s demand based on his concern that open-ended, in-person testimony “is driven more by governmental fascination with celebrity and headlines than by any proper investigative purpose,” added Spiro.The SEC initially issued two subpoenas for Jay-Z’s testimony in November 2017 and February 2018. The Brooklyn-born rapper neglected to comply both times, leading the SEC to file an enforcement action ordering him to show up in court for a hearing on May 8.""",

"@xeloris @Sound Investment Regarding the comparison between SQBG and ICON1.  Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)In 2018 ICON's CFO was going up from $2M to $55.6M www.koyfin.com/...while SQBG remained stagnant at $29Mwww.koyfin.com/...In the last 3 quarters ICON used this cash to pay off $48M debts while SQBG paid off only $3M. 2. EBITDAICON declined 30% from $120.8M to $83.8M - reflecting the loss of the DTRs including Sears' bankruptcy, otherwise it would be approx. $90M. After a further decline until Q1/2019  this will slightly improve from Q2/2019 on with new signed licensees starting in 2019.www.koyfin.com/...SQBG declined only 10% from $99.5M to $89.8M, which may in 2019 also improve thanks to one(!) brand at Walmart.www.koyfin.com/...So while SQBG was relatively stable/stagnant, ICON came down from a high level. Regarding EBITDA they are now in the same range. While SQBG has not many possibilities to improve, ICON can only improve by replacing the lost DTRs of many(!) brands. ICON is generating 2 times the CFO of SQBG. The difference is, that this cash flow is drained by Cash Flow for financing, but actually it means that ICON is creating value by paying off debts.Furthermore one has to ask the following question: With EBITDA in the same range, how can it be, that ICON's portfolio is with $423M worth less than half of SQBG's portfolio with $995M?Probably in 2019 this discrepancy may have some adjustments, with SQBG booking further impairment charges, while ICON has done that already in the last 3 years. Maybe it will balance out with both companies having a market cap of $30M, which is still ridiculously low for both companies.But as of the last day in 2018 a $30M market cap means SQBG down 50% and ICON up 500%.",
"Hi everyone,In late September, someone I know who is the founder and CEO of an investment fund recruited me to research and do analysis of companies, and I’ve been busy doing that in my free time. The last company I researched and analyzed for them got investments of $10 million from our investors. I work full-time running a nonprofit, so I’m doing the investment fund work on the side and it has limited my time to post in online forums. A few people emailed me in the last month to ask if I still have my position in Iconix, and the answer is yes. I think now would be a bad time to sell. The company is priced as if it’s definitely going bankrupt and that is not the case. Mossimo, Danskin, Starter and OP have not been at Walmart and Target in several months, so there is no further fall-off to come from them. 3 of those 4 don't yet have a new home so there is good potential for all three to have good increases in revenue in the next 1-2 years. Many consumers still view them positively.I might recommend Iconix to the investment fund - it could possibly become a majority owner of the company and do some good things with it.International sales are surging, and Starter’s comeback is well underway with the NFL MVP front-runner Patrick Mahomes showing up at the stadium wearing a team Starter jacket last month - ftw.usatoday.com/...… and it getting 45,000 likes - www.instagram.com/...Last year’s Super Bowl champs wearing Starter jackets in London - 247sports.com/...High Snobiety putting Starter in the best 20 American brands -www.highsnobiety.com/...

I just spent an interesting morning reading an article on the Microsoft News / Money app regarding great big white elephants that  represent financial disasters for the economies of the countries involved.The Greek Olympic complex that cost 9 billion Euros which lies empty and abandoned which took the Greek economy to the brink of bankruptcy.A 5 billion capital city in Myanmar which largely lies empty built on the advice of a seer or sooth sayer.Brazilian sports stadiums that litter the country costing vast sums and which are largely unused.Montreal sports stadiums and airports built at eye-watering costs that are great big white elephants.I think we can add certain share buy backs to this list. Not to mention any in particular.Grandiose idiotic decisions!Right about now Pharaoh should be seeking someone to interpret his dreams. Wherefore-art thou Joseph?,

Why would he put his reputation at stake?Screening the stock market for a comparable stock with the following parameters: Market cap < $40M; Average volume (3m): > 500'000 shares; P/E>0results in ICON and AETI. The difference between these two companies are, that AETI has no debt, but also no positive FCF. AETI's chart is extremely erratic on good news.

Well ICON hit around the 5M market cap at 7.7 today..  Which means it requires 200% gain by May to escape delisting due to nasdaq market cap requirements.   I bet its going to be hard to find a loan in this environment..,
What a Christmas eve! With only a bit over 1 M shares traded on a short day. MM only needs less of $100K  to beat it further down to new low and manipulate the SP easily. The opposite could be highly possible too. Just when? Cuneo is an old hand. what's going through his mind now? Did he run all of his 7 turnarounds down to the ditches himself then rescue them one by one? Are we lucky enough to be his 8th? The Board and top management team can't be hiding and shy away from their fiduciary duty to the shareholders. That would be malpractice.Having a company Christmas party to celebrate now when your SP going down to $0.08 is truly disgusting.

Carter Enterprises, Marcy Media Holdings, LLC and Marcy Media LLC in connection with the above-captioned matter. Following the filing of the Petition in this action, the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) has committed to work with Petitioners to identify and make available African-American arbitrators for consideration, which may moot Petitioners’ need for further relief. Accordingly, Petitioners hereby withdraw Motion Sequence 001 for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to allow for negotiations with AAA and Respondents on an arbitrator selection  process that comports with New York public policy.I.BackgroundAs the Court is aware, this dispute stems for AAA’s failure to provide a diverse roster of arbitrators to oversee a complex commercial arbitration in New York. Petitioners filed an Article 75 Petition seeking a temporary stay, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction of a pending AAA arbitration on the ground that the applicable arbitration provision is void as against public policy due to AAA’s failure to provide diverse arbitrator candidates and, specifically, African-American arbitrators. On November 28, 2018, the Court (Scarpulla, J.) granted Petitioners’ application for a temporary restraining order, preventing the parties from  proceeding with the arbitrator selection process while the Court considered Petitioners’ claims.

In other words, Amazon wants the option of buying out Biyani and taking over the company in the future.""""A deal with FRL will give Amazon access to the former's pan-India footprint. The retail network boasts over 2,000 stores in 355 cities and towns in every Indian state except Arunachal Pradesh. Each of these stores can act as a primary distribution points for a digital player like Amazon, allowing it to extend food and grocery deliveries within a 2-3 hour time frame.Similarly, Amazon stands to leverage Future Lifestyle Fashions' clothing and footwear brands, including Lee Cooper, Converse, Sketchers, Indigo Nation and Scullers, by creating exclusive digital storefronts for them on its portal.

"Ultimately, I still believe ICON needs to do a refinance/restructure.  In that case, you have to ask yourself how much equity in NewCo are the current equity holders going to get?I don't think ICON wants to completely wipe out the existing equity, but they do want to minimize the amount of NewCo that old equity holders receive. The longer they wait, the less the equity is worth, and the less of NewCo equity they need to give to the old equity holders.I also think they need to wait on any restructuring because debt holders will need to know what's happening with the Sears business before any deal can be worked out.So I think we need to wait for more clarity on Sears before we can get more clarity on ICON.  Meanwhile, downward pressure on the stock price is likely to continue.",

This decline may have been exacerbated by the passing of Mr Bush.I don't think it is wise to buy a financial institution that has been in decline for as long as DB has been especially if there are recessionary indicators.If markets in general become wobbly, then I say buy defensive utilities that pay a good dividend and which are likely to continue paying a good dividend if a recession were to develop.Wait to see if the DB price spiral's into oblivion.I guess if you are an existing shareholder that this is hard advice to listen too but it is what it is.That being said, I know they have been rigorously stress testing the banks with regard to their ability to withstand recessionary forces. I guess that if your due diligence indicates that DB has sufficient strength to weather any storms then perhaps it may prove a safe haven for you and possibly an investment with good upside.",

Moreover, the rates they pay now 5-6% will be exceeded in any refinancing agreement. Long story short, heads you lose, tails you lose, but focus on the word ""refinancing"" as a positive is being touted here.Again. Highly suggest ignoring this advice completely.

"The full letter posted here. From the time Jay Z refused to show up in court to him get subpoenaed by the judge, he and his legal team has been trying hard to fight the losing battles. Great news for Iconix and its shareholders. You make your own judgement call.------------------------------------------------------------------------------DJ Lack of Black Arbitrators Discriminatory, Jay-Z Says in New Filing Nov 28, 2018 15:53:00 (ET)By Corinne Ramey The rapper Jay-Z asked a New York state court Wednesday to halt arbitration proceedings in a business dispute, claiming the lack of available African-American arbitrators was discriminatory.In court papers filed Wednesday, lawyers for Jay-Z, whose given name is Shawn Carter, asked the judge to block arbitration proceedings for at least 90 days to allow the parties to find African-American arbitrators. A deadline for choosing arbitrators is this Friday, court documents say.Arbitration is a common procedure in business disputes in which the parties resolve disagreements out of court. Typically arbitration is binding, and the parties jointly choose either one or a panel of arbitrators as neutral third parties.Jay-Z's arbitration proceeding stemmed from a dispute with Iconix Brand Group, which in 2007 purchased Jay-Z's clothing brand Rocawear. In 2015, Iconix and Jay-Z reached a settlement that required any subsequent disputes to be resolved in arbitration.As part of the arbitration process, lawyers for Jay-Z and Iconix agreed to consult a list provided by trade group the American Arbitration Association, according to court documents. Jay-Z's lawyers said they reviewed more than 200 arbitrators who specialize in ""large and complex cases"" in the New York City area.""Of these potential arbitrators, Petitioners' counsel were unable to identify a single African-American arbitrator with the necessary qualifications to oversee the present case,"" Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Jay-Z, wrote in court documents.A spokeswoman for the American Arbitration Association said the group's policy isn't to comment on arbitrations. A lawyer for Iconix didn't respond to a request for comment.When Jay-Z's lawyers asked for African-American arbitrators, the association provided what it described as six arbitrators of color, court documents say. Jay-Z's lawyers said one appeared to be Asian-American, one South Asian and another Latino. One of the remaining three, his lawyers said, is a partner at a firm that represents Iconix.""The AAA has discriminated against Mr. Carter on the basis of his race by denying him privileges equal to those afforded to other non-minority parties,"" Jay-Z's lawyers wrote.Jonathan T.K. Cohen, a New York City-area arbitrator who isn't involved in the dispute, said he had attended conferences and events sponsored by the American Arbitration Association, and had seen an increase of women and people of color in attendance and on panels.""There's a tremendous push to diversify,"" he said.The idea that such organizations need a more diverse roster of arbitrators is a widely shared view in the arbitration world, including within those groups, said John Kiernan, former chair of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution, a dispute-resolution group.Still, he said, Jay-Z's legal argument faces a high bar.""For him to claim that it's unconstitutional for the AAA to not have enough arbitrators of color, when he personally agreed to have the AAA be the entity that would arbitrate his disputes, is likely not to be a legally appealing argument to a court,"" he said.Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones NewswiresNovember 28, 2018 15:53 ET (20:53 GMT)",

"@Sound Investment In my book there are 5 engines of growth:1) International, add licensors to new countries.2) Soccer, the world biggest sport and expanding-  Umbro is a world soccer brand. There are many countries and teams in Asia, Latin-America, and Africa that can/should be added.3) Basketball, there are countries in Europe that could do with Starter jackets for their teams4) Retro fashion. Iconix has many retro designs that modified can help to boost sales. Pinto is an example of what can be done. Other brands like London Fog can be remodeled like what was done to Burberry, etc.5) Capture synergies. Like making the best local designs available worldwide, also leverage brand and marketing at a global level.Some of this engines of growth intersect, like, if a new licensor for Umbro is appointed in Nigeria with a product design from England of soccer gear that has reminiscences from the past.

"“ secret lies in international...”Cautions are much needed on international marketing and development due to the tariffs threats. It’s not favorable to business such as consumer brands.  As Galvin mentioned that EU has become our biggest market then you have to wonder what happened to our market shares in Asia. Most of our brands targeting mid and low income families anywhere. From my personal experiences in trades between U.S. Vs Asian countries in the past that whenever politics got in the way of trade business, especially in international trades, often the damages are widespread severely  and long lasting due to the chains reactions. It’s lose/lose no winners coming out of this mess. People forgot easily that during our 2008-2009 crashes, it’s the Chinese who bought our debts and agreed to keep buying not selling our bonds. Otherwise US $$$ could have lost its world currency powerhouse position forever. A weak China economy, Europe included , won’t be a winning strategy at all. Some being naive that the tariffs will somehow helping US. It’s a tax that will add on to business costs then passed along to consumers. How would that help our international marketing and sales revenue? And international currencies traders can tell you that a small percentage of ups and downs will make or kill many international trade deals. Just ask our Ohio farmers how life going on Without the Fed and free money in $B billions to support them. Yes China has lots of problems regards to intellectual patents etc... but Americans are not smart enough to realize that our friend Israel is the No1 in that intellectual war? Anyway the international trades are more sensitive and harder to manage. So don’t count your eggs in that bucket. Could be gone sooner before you realize. JMHO",

We have had Aqua America as a 'Speculative' position within a 29 component 'Fixed Trust' established in 1987. I inserted all of our shares of 'Philadelphia Suburban', (changed to Aqua America ~2005-6) that I had acquired between ~1980-86 in to the trust at that time. The 'Cost Basis' without considering the dividends, but with 'Splits' and 'Acquisitions-Adjusted', has been calculated to be ~$1.90. I hadn't added shares until we enrolled in the company's Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP) just over 2 years ago through 'Computershare'. Their are NO 'Buying Fees', and the plan offers a 5% Discount on Reinvested Dividends. You can set up 'monthly-recurring' or '1-Time Buys', electronically, the later offering opportunistic buys in 'Dips', whereas the former offers arbitrary 'Dollar Cost Averaging' (DCA). I use both methods concurrently and desist from the ""recurring autobuys"" when share prices drift above $34.50. That's kept our 'Cost Basis' for the 'Discretionary', DSPP at ~$31.88 as of today. Interestingly, our ""DSPP"" position has ~equalled our ""Speculative"" Trust position, though we have paid ~17x as much for the DSPP shares. The first thing that amazed me has been the awesome long-term appreciation which if one were to sell equates into ""Long-Term"" 'Capital Gains' for Income Tax purposes -- a much lower rate than ""Short-Term"" -- ""Capital Gains"" and from Regulated H2O Utilities the dividends are classified as ""Qualified Dividends"" so they are treated advantageously for tax purposes (like ""long-term"" gains vs. ""short-term"").1 Thing First: Dilution - H2O vs Electric & Multiline UtilitiesAqua America like most, mostly Regulated Water Utilities, has little or NO ""Dilution"". In fact 'WTR' has had the same # of 'Common Shares', 178 million for many years, though their likely will be a rare, 'New' share issuance associated with the Acquisition of 'Peoples Natural Gas LLC', 'PNG' which now also includes 'Delta Natural Gas'. What's Delta Natural Gas?Delta Natural Gas was founded in 1949 and was originally, publicly traded seperately and paid Dividends continuously as a mostly Regulated 'Gathering', 'Distributing', 'Storage' company which also includes an Unregulated 'Upstream Production' segment. Delta's operations were located primarily in central Kentucky with its HQ in Winchester, Kentucky. It is, however, listed as an ""all cash transaction"", but the company has stipulated that they plan to issue some new shares, but will be adding ~$4.275 billion in 'Enterprise Value' from the acquisition of Peoples. The statement, issued by 'WTR' on October 23rd indicated that the projected 'Cagr' from 'PNG' is expected to be superior to that of the Water Segments, @ 8-10% versus ~7% for 'Annual Base Rate Growth' through 2021 and immediately accretive.What Else Is Different About Aqua America?Though according to the S&P's most recent report, Aqua America's current 'P/E' is ~24 versus >35 for both 'AWK' and 'AWR', 'WTR' still retains a 'SPGMI'* of A+,  and an Earnings 'Cagr', going forward of 5%, and a 4**** Rating. Its current 'PEG' was reported as '2.69' with a 2.54% 'Current Yield'.Further Comparisons In Next Post*'SPGMI' = S&P Global Market Intelligence Quality Rating",
"Like most people here, I own both.  I think the market overreacted to the Peoples acquisition by WTR.  In the long run I think it will be a plus (and will increase the dividend yield).I think AWK is the better company and that is where most of my ""water"" capital lies.  AWK was a huge winner before its acquisition by the German company and is right back on the same track after its divestiture by same.",
I prefer owning both,
WTR for better dividend!,
Big fan of WTR. Long time DRIPper and will continue.Cheers,
I own both.  I sold 1/3 of my position in WTR because I consider the Peoples acquisition to be outside the company's core competence and a completely unnecessary step.  I haven't added to AWK because the valuation is a bit higher than I'd like and the yield a bit lower.  I agree with the other commenters that water is a potentially great long term investment theme.,
"AWK and AWR have very substantially eclipsed WTR in terms of total return over the past (approximately) 3, 5 and 7 years.  FWIW.",
"I own both along with XYL and ECL which has a water division (NALCO).   Water, which has no substitute product, is a great long term investment theme with secular tailwinds.",
Great article!,
My dilemma as well. Owned both for a long time. My capital appreciation has been substantially better with AWK but in the interest of diversification I have kept both in equal amounts. I suppose I will keep it that way for the near future to see how WTR does in the gas distribution business. Guess one pipe is about the same as another. Time will tell.,
I'll stick with WTR and it's higher yield and 5% discount when DRiPping.,Should I Trade Aqua America For American Water Works?

"Eh, as I mentioned the struggles of 360fly and having it as current asset didnt look good- looks like chapter 11 to hit Q4 so thatWonder when Eyelock will declare bk or how long the continual cash burn will last... All IMO only.",
Looks like convertible debentures to Eyelock are over $40 mill now owed but not sure which line item those belong to. The 360fly converts I think are part of the increase in current assets line item.Hopefully we see a little pickup in audio and consumer accessories.All in my opinion only.,
"I disagree, Eyelock is a $40+ mill and counting tangible asset writeoff in my opinion. 360fly also is looking ugly, switching from an equity position to a debt position for VOXX in my opinion showing the struggles there.This management team is too spread out and not focused. Biometrics alone is a market the cash rich bigs will dominate compared to some tiny iris-recognition-only cash burning company being funded by a small struggling company also burning cash.These guys don't know when to pull the plug and are quickly wasting away their valuable asset sale cash.Hopefully the US economic strength and pick up in wage growth will help lift the retail product spaces they sell into.All just my opinion.",
"For everyone following Audiovox:What is everyone's ""sum of the parts"" valuation range for VOXX?Vince gave his valuation range in his November article.Let's all start a good discussion on the company's valuation.The various parts, if we agree, are:1.  ASA  ($6M pre-tax a year passive income in ASA investment, but declining slightly now).2.  Klipsch division (Premium Audio) ($130Mm to $150M revenue)3.  Auto division (with EVO infotainment ramp ongoing) ($150M revenue area and growing).4.  Consumer Accessories division  (being somewhat divested) (using $100M sales area).5.  ""Billion Dollar Wildcard"" of Eyelock  (One of the top 3 to 5 Iris scanning technologies available), but losing about $12M to $15M a year???)6.  Balance sheet has $30M to $50M of net cash and securities (higher if include ASA investment), $10 per share of tangible book value ($240M tangible book), and 24.5 shares outstanding).   The stock's EV is $50M to $70M with the stock at $4.   What range of EV is appropriate in everyone's opinion?",
"Thank you Vince. The eventual Eyelock deals are still primed to happen. The technology is waiting for the infrastructure and mass adaptation. Home door cube cameras  to 'invisible' security projects that are being funded, this all still needs time. Feels like selling now would be missing out. Yet paying for this keeps it down. Staying long considering the entry point and most of all, staying patient. They have turned things around, to their credit, but something is still just missing, some love from the street, and collective patience. I like the growing number of ideas and uses for newer products based around concepts such as Project Nursery. The connected & smarter toys to cube camera gizmos, will sell in mass volumes, in my opinion. Which will help VOXX with comps. As a continued slew of 'newer' consumer products roll into the global markets, they appear to have shifted their emphasis in time. We need more mass sold items with the bigger money auto contracts. These are all tied into the always developing 'untethered' economic infrastructure still developing. I guess I see the glass half full with this perplexing holding. If it over reacts and dips all the way back down again, we will add. Too much potential... is the opinion.",
"The consolidated German operations are going to be sold by the end of the fiscal year per the CC.  Those have a $3M EBITDA, so it's easy to see $70M in Cash by the end of February.   In that circumstance,  the current enterprise value is probably covered by their stake in ASA alone. Eyelock got publicity from the IGT booth too, and how much did it really cost to put the existing product into a box that IGT paid to build? Probably almost nothing.  You can't step into the ring with Muhammad Ali just because you think you can box.  You've got to prove yourself first.  This is first-semester business fundamentals,  during the product life cycle you don't make money in the development and introduction phases.  It's incredibly frustrating to watch though.  The technology is definitely coming. Without any question this tech will play a role in the future.  Whether Eyelock is part of that is questionable though.At any rate,  I appreciate hearing your input.",

"Another well written article Vince! Thx for sharing your thoughts. My previous posts pretty closely follow your overall viewpoint. If only there was a way to see them get proactive with Eyelock. It costs them tons of $. I certainly don't trust a management team that talks up acquisitions without much buying back of common when cash is available and exaggerates the value of the company's shares to drive home the hypocrisy of making acquisitions while ignoring the supposed discounted value of the company's own shares.I guess it does show they realize how completely stupid many investors in their common shares are (thinking shareholders wouldn't blink at the financial stupidity of blowing cash on speculative acquisitions instead of obtain tremendous ROI by simply buying back shares in a business they know better than any other- their own).Anyhow, I'm giving the old mold treatment on a few of the shares I have left (wait for a miracle of value realization by the market eventually).Good luck, keep an eye on OPXS by the way. Much much more competent/shareholder friendly mngmnt team and just beginning to recover after years of attrition in their industry.All just my personal opinion.","VOXX International: Hey, Wait A Minute, That Was A Decent Quarter"

Innovation is dead at Apple.  Tim needs to acquire Instant Pot as the next best thing to slice bread.  :),
"This narrative regarding unit sales is exactly why Apple will stop reporting them. The narrative will chNge to revenue and profits. Then the negative views won’t be able to point to a legal document to support their thesis, they will have to point to conjecture and pseudo facts peddled by the likes of idc.While much of the what if’s you say are plausible what is different about today from 2 months ago? If you look at the tech stocks they have all fallen sharply over the past month and yet we do not hear the same doom and gloom the sky is falling about the others.We have a bear market in stocks and the street did not take kindly to a major data point being taken from them. However the economy is still pretty strong , supported by a labor market that has been growing for some time now. The threat of tariffs and inflation have not taken a bite out of the economy yet. The proof that Apple is failing boils down to various rumors that Apple is not selling as many phones as last year. Curiously we heard the same rumors last year which of course turned out to be true.We will all have to wait till next year to see what Apple reports.Most likely the fall was a result of various emotional factors unrelated to any particular company and the fact that money managers were sitting on sizable gains in their tech portfolio that they wanted to cash in.",

Or  ""Apple is just fine, this is a massive market overreaction, the company has a ridiculous cash stockpile and is still selling a ton of products and more and more services""How about the truth is neither?  The fact is the current movement in the stock is built on analysts who have been punishing the stock because it's the company everyone loves to hate.  Why? Because it defies the street mentality over and over again and has done so for years.This moment was created because Apple told us they weren't going to be the only major smartphone maker still saying how many units it shipped, because no other major player in the space was doing so.  Are they wrong for wanting a level playing field and to be judged on the health and growth of the company overall?  Well they must be, so let's pound this trillion-dollar company with this type of weak opinionated drivel that creates the panic that pushes the weak off of the shares.  And the next thing you know, we've seen a 25% drop in AAPL.It's madness, built on another bet against the company, that so many have made--so many times before.  So, when Apple stores are empty, or when Wal-Mart stops selling out of Apple products on Black Friday, or when any college student tells me they'd really rather have a Chinese made handset with a name they can't pronounce over an iPhone--that's when I'll think about selling in a panic.",

How much will this affect it's decision making? It is hedged at horrible numbers on gas--will prices rise enough for it to make money in the spot market and stay high long enough for better hedges? Will the merger be approved? Will another offer for WRD hit the table? Will WRD, since it is acquiring 45% of CHK and has much more concentrated ownership, now effectively control CHK? Will the Utica proceeds in fact be applied to debt or, as seems likely, go to capex in which case CHK's long term debt will go up, if anything? Too many what-ifs to predict anything about this stock.

I think its a classic issue with diversification when you diversify into numerous different securities it becomes difficult if not impossible to know a specific company/sector inside out.

Companies that  did end up going private that were SPECIFICALLY bought out by some type of ""insider"" or prior insider that ALREADY OWNED the MAJORITY of the outstanding shares AT THE TIME OF THE PROPOSAL. I always remember being suprised the insider/acquirer offered such a high premium to the market price. I always thought those times the offer was even too high. I assume its partly because the buyer already knows the company well. And knows what the true fair value is.  This could very likely happen here. Sibelco knows these assets and since they still see the merger price as the true fair value I think Sibelco would pay $20-$30.

Production declined Q3 vs. Q2 for ex.  - 1 - 2 bn$/yr is spent on green nonsense*. (This point is painted positive in this analysis!!!)

"I called the early 2018 AMC rally and called the short position on AMC leading into Q3 earnings so I've made $ on both the long and short side. Therefore AMC investors may want to listen to me.IMO, the poor Q3 earnings had little to do with the sell off. The sell off was mainly due to incorrect pricing of A-list at $20 a month for 12 movies (3 a week is basically ""unlimited""). Movie memberships will never be gym memberships where you have to suffer to get results, movies are a special treat. A-list was jumped all over by people who have all the time in the world to see movies and it is cannibalization of AMCs core base (as noted by Sinemia's CEO). PS. Aqua-man early screens are all coming back incredibly positive. This will help nerf 2018 SWs, and will help us yoy for attendance. However, I see this as short term noise and a great buying opportunity. We are at the base of the best movie season in human history, 2019 will blow the doors off. I believe Aron is smart enough to correct the error in AMC A-list pricing in the next 4 to 5 months, which needs to be around $28 to $35 a month (for 12 movies) or design multiple plans that target the somewhat infrequent visitor. For example, plans that offers 3 movies a month for $12 to $19, whatever the analytics support.

"A pivotal trial for microdystrophin gene therapy is set to begin late this year or early 2019, and will be on an accelerated approval pathway. This could easily carry a treatment cost of $4-5 million and will be a huge cash generator for Sarepta. Myocytes don't divide, and the gene is delivered to the nucleus without being incorporating in to the cell's DNA, and should theoretically last 10-15 years before another dose is needed. To discount this part of the thesis and barely mention it in your recommendation to sell is just irresponsible, imo. Not to mention that the same approach and vector is being used for 5 different limb-girdle muscular dystrophy programs, with the first data readout in early 2019. With a fresh $500m of cash on hand, you can expect Sarepta to continue to buyout late-stage gene therapy programs and advance more PPMO candidates to the clinic. As for your thesis that promovi will fail, you simply reference the FDA briefing docs where they estimate the level of dystrophin production that could be necessary to confer a clinical benefit. There hasn't been a drug that's successful at actually increasing dystrophin levels before, so while I'm sure this is a well-educated assumption by the researchers they've questioned, it's quite lazy to base the whole negative thesis on this one point. We don't know what the benefit will be for patients long term, but we've seen more insurance companies come around and cover the drug due to it's benefits, and plenty of anecdotal evidence of the drug improving patient's lives, though I agree that this isn't the best information to use. If you're going to try to predict clinical trial results, you should provide a scientific perspective that brings a new idea to the table. This is all old info. Long Sarepta.",
"Nice hit piece with only the negative view. The data package for the confirmatory trial is not due in mid 2019. The FDA will be looking at the totality of the package in 2021. IMO, the bigger story here is the near-term catalyst on the GT side of the pipeline.",

"it is difficult to see any optimistic outlook for Colombia or the GDP growth rates forecast for 2018/2019 being achieved. The latest oil crash wil likely shave up to 1% off those forecasts and see full year 2018 GDP growth of 2% of less and likely cause 2019 to be at around the same level. It will also cause the fiscal deficit to widen and lead to further budget cuts as Duque attempts to reduce the deficit because crude makes up around half of all export income and a fifth of fiscal revenues. If that occurs then it is unlikely that the Banco de la Republica will hike interest rates because econmic growth will remain flat.Consumption is weak and business sentiment remains poor. There is unlikely to be any improvement because Colombian households are tapped out after a massive explosion in consumer credit over the last 5 years. This is magnified by Duque applying IVA (VAT) to consumer basics which were exempt plus wage growth has failed to keep up with inflation. Duque's much vaunted tax reform will further reduce household disposable incomes particularly at the lower end and it is likely thathis plans to improve tax collection and hence fiscal revenues will fail. Endemic corruption, systemic failings and a broken legal system will prevent effective enforcement and compliance. The full effects of the Odebrecht corruption scandal have yet to be fully felt. While the govement has considerable spending commitments including funding the 2016 peace deal with the FARC and completing the 4G road program. These will create additional budgetary pressures. Security is breaking down in many cities and rural areas despite the peace deal, forcing the government to spend more on military and policing deployments.The credit loss cycle has yet to end and I wouldn't be surprised to see an uptick in credit losses and non-performing loans among Colombian banks including Bancolombia which will drain capital for greater lending loss provisions. Bancolombia also relies upon anachronistic systems, management methodologies and processes which are acting as a significant drain on productivity and margins. The only thing which will push Bancolombia shares higher is if the COP strengthens against the USD which means Brent would need to rebound to over $70 a barrel. Overall Bancolombia will likely remain flat until the economic issues are dealt with and it brings its operations and methodoligies into the 21st century.",

"Pay close attention to retail sales growth broken down into same store sales as well as dealer expansion and the number of actual new riders coming into the brand (“create 2M riders...”) as true leading indicators for your investment thesis. Right now HOG isn’t reporting same store sales or the progress towards the 2M riders, or maybe I’ve missed it?Quarterly fluctuations in revenue are easily adjusted based on shipments and mix. For example, Q3 of 2017 far less touring bikes were shipped due to the new product launch; this year same quarter the mix returned to a more normalized amount hence a 16% increase in revenue. Clearly the brand is strong but not relevant with so many as it’s old and stale. The livewire will finally launch helping modernize the perception of the brand - key will be follow on livewire variants at lower price points to get accelerated adoption beyond early adopters. Until HOG starts reporting actual progress towards their strategic goals of new riders and same store sales performance I am bearish.

"Maybe this article explains the 8% pop in NWL's stock price yesterday? I literally just bought this stock in a ROTH IRA on November 12th, and with a 17% gain in less than 2 weeks, it's tempting to to sell and pocket a $6k tax-exempt gain. On the other hand, the stock still seems reasonably valued, and on track to pay down debt, buy back shares, and focus on higher margin products. Same issue with VOD, which I also bought on the 12th. The stock has rallied by 13% in a very short period of time, but rather than sell and cash in on a $7k tax-exempt gain, I'm thinking that I will continue to hold VOD as an income generator. I don't see many other yield opportunities in that range, and with the recent dividend freeze, the payout looks safe for the time being.  One possibility might be to just sell off 6k of NWL and 7k of VOD, thank Mr. Market for the tax-free gains, pop those proceeds into a lower risk asset category (maybe short-term bond fund like SHY?) and just maintain my original investment. Not sure what I'm going to do with this... if anything. Great trading on the part of the author.

"As a Model 3 owner, the author's article was full of inaccuracies and misunderstandings on his part.  For the sake of brevity, let's just talk about regenerative braking.  There are two settings - low (which feels pretty comparable to an ICE car braking through the drive train) and standard (which slows the car through regenerative braking at a more aggressive rate - similar to moderate braking in an ICE car).  At first I used the low setting - it fells the same as an ICE car.  But after just a few hours of driving, I graduated to the standard setting.  I now drive with one pedal, rarely using the brake pedal.  If I want to slow a little, I slightly back off the accelerator.  If I want normal, moderate braking, I take my foot completely off the accelerator.  If I need rapid braking, I engage the brake pedal as well.  It is easy as can be, and as Tesla owners know, results in very little wear to brake pads and rotors.The author says that other drivers would be surprised at a car decelerating that fast.  He apparently assumes that the brake lights do not come on in the standard regen braking mode.  This is incorrect.  The brake lights are activated by an accelerometer, not by a mechanical switch in the brake pedal like an ICE car.  If the Model 3 decelerates faster than a certain rate, the brake lights come on.  I note that the author states he has no position in the stocks mentioned.  He does not state if he has any put options.  I have no position in TSLA stock or options.  I just own a Model 3 and it is a great car.",

"@oldschooljohn >>>It's a testament to the incredible brand loyalty of Tesla that customers are lining up to buy them regardless of the panel gaps and paint defects.<<<Actually, I would tend to think that it is more of a testament to the idea that the fundamental capability of a Tesla can't be had in any other product on the market today near the price point.ICE cars got to the point of cosmetic capability not because it added much value but that it is an intensely competitive market with low differentiation.  Cosmetic flaws are the surface level way to differentiate between products so one better not fail it as ""first impressions can't be undone"".  When the underlying technology is perceived to be similar (and it is) and problems often don't show up for a couple of years, the consumer will take a ""first impression"" as a stand in for those parameters they can't realistically value initially.I agree with your statement of apples to apples comparisons: ""However, they are generally accepted by the automotive industry to be an overall indicator of the quality of the car, the thinking being something like, ""if they can't get the panels to fit together properly, there must be other assembly flaws and defects that we can't see.""So when Tesla does have competition that is comparable in basic function, these will become just as important as they are in the ICE market today.  So by then Tesla better get this right.  In the meantime, it will still detract for part of the market but the lack of choice will still dictate a Tesla for the fundamental feature set.   But the clock is ticking and Tesla needs to be on par on all aspects of ICE vehicles to eliminate this as a objection.  Fortunately, they seem to recognize and are attempting to address the issue.",
"Regarding panel fit, body fit and finish are surely cosmetic and do not affect the functionality or utility of the car.  However, they are generally accepted by the automotive industry to be an overall indicator of the quality of the car, the thinking being something like, ""if they can't get the panels to fit together properly, there must be other assembly flaws and defects that we can't see.""  This is, I believe, what the writer is suggesting in this article and this is why so many Tesla critics are harping on this issue.  Fit and finish issues have turned out to be reliable indicators for quality concerns with other cars, but it may be that the Model 3 is a superbly manufactured car that just happens to have some cosmetic flaws.  Only time will tell.  What's interesting is that no other car manufacturer would dream of putting a 50k car on the showroom floor sporting those kinds of blemishes.  It's a testament to the incredible brand loyalty of Tesla that customers are lining up to buy them regardless of the panel gaps and paint defects.",
"Thanks for you interesting observations.  Regarding Tesla growth potential, some people seem to think that the Model 3 has somehow created a new class of buyers who are willing and able to spend 50k or more on their daily driver.  If this were true, we surely would have seen many more Audis, BMWs, Lexi and Mercedes on the road in pre-Model 3 days. No doubt the Model 3 will steal many sales from these brands, but once these buyers have bought, the rest of us ""average"" folks who can only afford to spend 30k or so will look longingly at the Model 3, sigh, and then move on to whatever fits our budget.",

"Very cute how you believe you can fully understand this vehicle, which is fundamentally different from any car you have ever driven on a day to day basis, after a 30 minute test drive.Let's take this apart shall we?Scheduling:I have scheduled via the Online calendar, which worked flawlessly, so I can't really say much to the phone version.The Vehicle:While I agree, that different color options costing a bunch of dollars is not nice, the ""Aero wheels"" are actually pretty good alloy rim wheels with the ""Aero"" plastic cap on top, that can be removed if you don't like them. Other customization, yeah would be nice but let's don't fool ourselves, this is a brand new vehicle, I can't see other manufacturers offering the full portfolio right away.The 35000$ Model is announced for next year. One reason for this is obviously construction costs that are dropping significantly in the first year. Another is the battery cost per kWh, which is also dropping with a goal of ~100$/kWh. Also, while the ""cheapest"" Model 3 right now is still 46k, it also still has the glass roof, the leather interior and the full blown sound system. So the cost reduction comes solely from the reduction of the Battery capacity.Btw. a Tesla without Autopilot is not a bad choice at all. While Autopilot is a very nice feature, you still get the electric driving experience, which is extremely responsive acceleration and silent driving. You also get to drive one of the safest cars on the road today. And don't forget: It accelerates like a race car, but has the ""fuel"" economy of a Prius.Test Drive:Regen. breaking:Rather than playing with the menu settings while driving, you can easily control the strength of the Regenerative breaking by taping on the accelerator: Not pushed = max Regen. breaking. Slight push = less breaking. More pushing = acceleration. Of course as a regular ICE driver one does not know that, which is why I repeat: A 30 minute test drive does not make you an expert on this vehicle.Regen. breaking in fact works differently in a Model 3 over an X or S, because this car has a switched reluctance motor over an induction motor. Very advanced technology, more efficient than the typical induction motors and does not require large amounts of permanent magnets made of precious metals like permanent magnet motors. It can also handle heat a lot better, because the rotor is made of solid Magnet-steel.The ""Menu"". Well while driving you actually never have to enter this. Music, Navigation, Cruise control is accessible via the steering wheel, climate and seat warmer via a button on the main screen. It's really not a big deal. I never have to execute anything complex on the screen exceeding 2 taps while driving.Autopilot:Yes it's not perfect and never will be. That said. My daily commute is 80% on Autopilot now. While it has it's quirks, there has never been a situation where I felt unsafe using it. I rather felt like it was overly cautious. Give it a month and you know every single quirk of it and what to look out for.While engaged you have to stay alert, correct. But the level of concentration needed is not even close to driving yourself. Also you can focus on more important things than staying in your lane and keeping a constant speed, like ""What are the cars around me doing?"". On the highway and in dense traffic the system is unbeatable already. I've never been stuck in traffic for 2 hours out of New York and arrived that relaxed at my destination in a car without Autopilot.Conclusion:The car is actually pretty amazing and except for the single charge range superior to regular ICE cars. While there are ICE cars that accelerate faster, they are not as ""fuel"" efficient as a Prius.And while there are more efficient ICE cars, they usually accelerate like a potato. (I've driven them, so I know what it's like.Comfort wise one has to like the minimalist look of the Model 3. Which I personally do, a lot.OTA updates are one of the best features, not a disatvantage. While most ICE cars may get a Software update for the Radio during an inspection, the Model 3 actually gains new, useful features. The latest one is using the front facing camera as a dash cam. I just plug in my 5$ USB stick, now I have a full blown dash cam that I don't have to mount on my windshield with cables dangling around.I've now driven over 5000 miles on my Tesla and a Love it. I've driven many different ICE cars before, from Ford Fiesta, over BMW 3 and 5, Audi 4,6 and Q5. None of them compare to driving electric. Autopilot is the cherry on top.Oh and to the favorite topic Panel gaps: My car is fine on those. I have maybe one or two that are slightly off. But it's nothing but a cosmetic flaw, which I think they even correct if you bring it in under warranty. I've driven through snow and rain storms and none of those slightly bigger panel gaps has caused any problems. Absolutely over-hyped problem.",

"I started as a pretty serious EV skeptic.  Then I drove my friend's long range rwd Model 3 for a long curvy drive out to the coast.  The car was a pure joy to drive, way more fun than my BMW.My lease on my BMW 328 was almost up, so I came home and put an order in for a Model 3 Dual Motor AWD.  Took delivery in September.  No major fit or finish issues.  Did have to wait several hours on the delivery day, which was annoying.  With the tax credits, it is slightly less than the loaded BMW 328 I had before.  Prior to that we have owned several Audi A4s and BMW 328s.  I will freely admit that the Model 3 takes some getting used to.  That makes me think that a single test drive may not enough time to adjust to it and appreciate the differences from a conventional sports sedan.  At this price point, my view is that there is nothing on the road that even comes close.  To get comparable performance in a four sedan, you are looking at a serious step up in price.Tesla as a company has plenty of issues, and I don't have a position in the stock.  I do hope the company succeeds as it has incredible potential, but there are certainly many operational challenges for them to overcome.",

"@Kevin Wenck, CFA - ""What I am suggesting overall is that effectively an underdeveloped and under-tested vehicle was rushed to market.""That conclusion statement was not substantiated by what you wrote in the article. You didn't like the regen and you didn't like the stiffer suspension. Those were choices by Tesla that most owners like, having nothing to with being underdeveloped.You have a valid criticism of Autopilot's Drive on Nav feature. However that is clearly labeled as Beta which you must acknowledge when you enable it. And it was released as an over the air update a couple of months ago for S/X/3, having nothing to do with the the development of Model 3. The more mature features of Autopilot worked flawlessly according to you.Tesla has delivered over 100,000 Model 3's. There have been zero recalls. The product is not underdeveloped, but your logic is in your attempt to paint a negative picture of Model 3 and Tesla.",
"The same thing happened to me, for the scariest experience I've had in years: ""Autopilot...then suddenly tried to veer back to the left to continue on the freeway.""Except in my case Autopilot *yanked* (not veered) my Model 3 to the left into a left-hand exit lane, with the front left corner of my car almost halfway into the exiting lane, and with a barrier just a few feet away, between the lane I had been in, and the lane Autopilot wanted to be in.  Fortunately I had my hands on the wheel and didn't have a heart attack, so I was able to *yank* the car back into the lane I had been in.I called in this report to Tesla, and the guy I spoke with shared my concern and thanked me.  Then I got a call from someone in engineering, I presume, who left a voicemail saying basically Autopilot isn't perfect and get used to it.  He expressed no interest in fixing the problem for future drivers at the location I had specified.  FYI, this happened to me on I-66/US 50 eastbound in DC, just east of the Potomac River, where there is a left-hand exit.",

"@Kevin Wenck, CFA First, props for actually driving the car.  It brings to mind our old friend Donn Bailey who once ""test drove"" a Model S from the back seat, while it sat parked inside a Tesla showroom.  (He determined it didn't have the proper rear seat leg room, an ever-important aspect of the Tesla buying decision).Second, you've misjudged regen braking.  Using it automatically turns on the brake lights, so there's no danger to the car behind you. You also modulate it by slowly lifting your foot, not suddenly releasing it like you would an ICE vehicle.  Regen is simply brilliant on this car, and I say that as a 15-year driver of manual transmissions.  Single-pedal driving is insanely superior in ease and performance, and results in brake pads that last well beyond 100,000 miles.Third, autopilot is absolutely brilliant in traffic and for long highway trips, as you noticed.  It removes all the stress from commuting.  The exit feature is brand new, and yes, you always need to stay alert.Lastly, yes, Tesla is the worst assembler of automobiles on the planet.  Despite this, and while running at less than 50% planned Model 3 capacity, they turned a profit with large positive cash flow in Q3.  (They'll do so again in Q4)So, if Tesla can't make automobiles efficiently, why are some of us bullish?  Because everyone else is tied for the worst automotive innovator.  One is easy to fix and getting better every day.  The other is intractable and in-grained in legacy product preservation. It will cost billions to fix.  GM, just today, announced 5 plant closings and a 3B+ charge.  Ford is holding meetings with dealers to reassure them that everything is A-OK.  BMWs sedan sales are plummeting.  VW named Tesla as their top competition.  Despite all of this, the Model 3 will have zero direct competition until the early 2020s.  This is a train-wreck in slow motion.  At least both sides agree on that much.",

"""As described above, the car that I test drove was the rear wheel drive “mid-range” version (with an announced range of 260 miles) that had a price with options of $54,000"".260 miles for $54k? Scam. How much for the battery upgrade(""fuel cost"") to go 300 miles?",
Excellent article and very true statement about rushed development causing unnecessary problems with the production version.,
"It's interesting that you diss the regen for being too strong on the Model 3 when many people I know wish it was stronger than it is, in fact, many people (shorters and others) hyped up the Bolt having stronger regen than the Model 3. The Model 3 recently got an upgrade to regen which made it a bit stronger than it used to be, honestly though, I have one and still wish it was even stronger than it is. If for some reason you can't stand the regen on the strong level, just set it to the lower setting. To hype this as an issue with Tesla's product development process when in fact it functions exactly as they intended, is misinformation at best or disingenuous lies at the worst, even more-so when some people still desire even stronger regen than it has currently.Once you get used to one foot driving with regen, you quickly realize it's a safety feature that allows for much quicker response to obstacles in front of you that need to be avoided by braking as the car is already slowing down quickly in the half second or so it takes you to move your foot over to the brake for a fast stop. It's also easier to drive/less of a hassle in that you rarely need to lift your foot to the brake pedal in normal driving. Not to mention of course that regen saves significant wear and tear on the brake pads and actually regenerates energy for the car, especially in urban or hilly/mountainous situations. What's not to love about this feature?",

"My MBA and 35 years doing equity research tells me these things:The services business is only 1 out of 8 revenue dollars for Apple and will take a long time to become a key driver of their revenue and earnings.As their top phones become $1,000+ devices, they are setting themselves up to see slowing unit sales (hence the stoppage of reporting on unit sales).Larger margins on outsized annual price increases of phones is not a sustainable long term strategy. If you increase the phone price (and let's for the moment say margin as well) by 15%, yes, you can afford to see some unit sales drop and still get the same revenue and net income as before.  However, the biggest driver of multiples and sustained share price increase will be EPS growth, and to do that their revenue and earnings CAGRs need to be, at the very least, holding at a near double digit clip.  Unfortunately if you look at a rolling series of 3 year CAGRs, you will see that for both revenue and earnings CAGRs are getting progressively smaller (a partial derivative analysis for you calculus fans).  Hence their learnings will paint the graph of a parabola, rather than rising line.The days of cellular companies offering compelling phone upgrade deals are long gone.  Hence, more customers are holding their phones for longer periods of time, so the replacement cycle is lengthening.  The lengthening replacement cycle for phones will also serve as a drag on Apple's future growth rate.Competitors are beginning to fill the $400 to $700 pricing sweet spot with more and more competitive offerings.  This is also a risk for Apple.I have been an Apple loyalist for many years and I wish them well, but I have seen in other industries what happens when you become reliant on price increases for your revenue and earnings growth rate and it is not pretty.",

"Apple usually trades in a range of 12-18 forward P/E.  The P/E currently stands at ~12.  Apple's guidance was for YOY revenue growth and they haven’t missed on their guide in many years.  The ongoing buyback is targeted to reduce the cash balance to equal the debt.  This equates to $124b available for the buyback.  Apple is throwing off ~$50b in excess cash per year available for additional buybacks.  So, in the next three years Apple could theoretically buy back  $274b in shares.  With the current market cap of ~$800b, they could theoretically buy back 1/3 of the float.  Buying back 1/3 of the float would result in EPS going up 50%.   Since EPS is projected to come in around $14-15 in 2019, the buyback could easily result in EPS of over $20 in 2021.  This assumes flat corporate earnings for 3 years.I think we might be in a period of flat corporate earnings, maybe a year or two.  But the buyback would still cause the EPS to grow 11% per year (based on $20b per Q buyback).   Then, in 2021 you should be entering the 5G super cycle.  So, you don’t need iPhone unit growth.  You don’t need a hit new product.  You jus need Apple to slowly add to services, grow the user base, keep making incremental improvements in all the hardware lines, and keep iPhone revenue in the ballpark and you’ll have a $300 stock going into 2021.",
"Market share matters because Apple is not only selling a product, it is selling an ecosystem. The revenue from their services is very tightly tied to their own platform and their own hardware. Losing iPhone sales = losing users from the ecosystem = losing future services revenue.Right now developer support for Apple's ecosystem is strong as it is the most profitable customer base, even if it is small compared to Android. However, if the market share shrinks the ecosystem will lose relevance to the developers as well and that is the death spiral that Nokia and Microsoft went down on. That said, Apple is doing great and if it wasn't the most valuable company on the planet everything would still look quite peachy. But it is the most valuable company on the planet and in my opinion the business as it stands can not support that weight. Apple is currently a maker of luxury electronics with a handful of products.As the author stated, Apple needs to become more than a boutique phone maker. However, apart from the revenue rise it's not doing a very good job with that. The media side is horribly late and will have Apple playing catch-up.

"Agree that negative impact of Amazon Whole Foods on Sprouts has been way overblown.  WF needs to operate in densely populated higher income neighborhoods where customers are blind to price and want high quality foods.   WF prices are probably at least 20% higher than SFM.   SFM is still expanding into lesser populated places where WF will never go.  SFM doesn't want to outgrow its carefully built distribution operation and vendor sourcing.  WF was suffering when Amazon bought it.  Still remains to be seen if Amazon can make enough money to justify the price it paid for WF.....or, more importantly, if AMZN can actually make money in ecommerce as AWS currently carries all the load for them.  My guess is that the competition for organic food is coming from many sources including Kroger which sees an opportunity on higher margin sales.   Consumers are willing to pay a large upcharge to buy organic even if there is no science proving the additional money spent is worth it.   All retailers are willing to jump on the organic bandwagon and some even wish to copycat Sprouts success.   Organic food ---from what I can tell---appears to be a strong preference of a certain percent of population that is going to pay more ---unlikely to be just another fad---just like selling brand name aspirin for a much higher retail price.My impression is that SFM has a solid business model which can build out stores at a reasonable rate and much more profitable than most grocers.  This is except for individually owned specialty store chains that price 35% over mainstream grocers but invest heavily in lighting and produce a unique grocery shopping experience.  Sprouts isn't going to follow that high end model and will do just fine.....in my opinion.",Sprouts Farmers Market Is Doing Well Despite Amazon Threat

Why?If LTBR had such great breakthrough technology, I am fully confident LTBR would not be begging for a DOE grant to keep the show running...LTBR would have been bought long long time ago either by nuclear industry giants or some other investor...LTBR technology is no secret...anyone in the Industry can ascertain if LTBR approach is economically feasible...and if it was...it would have been bought already...do you know something that the big nuclear players don't know about LTBR that makes it so great and potentially very profitable?? Probably not... beware of ""I know something the others don't know"" fallacy",
"Firstly, to the author, thank you for your detailed analysis. I really enjoyed reading both of your articles!  Situm: while I understand you have concerns, your comments are extremely alarming and I just wanted to clarify from my perspective an alternative viewpoint: 1) There are only two primary questions: does the fuel work as suggested (all of the benefits of safety and higher output, etc) and; will LTBR have enough funding and resources to actually see it through final regulatory approval that results in sales revenue from utilities?To use your FDA analogy, a DOE FOA grant would be the equivalent of “Drug Orphan status” or “Fast Track” status.  Both would be ideal in speeding up the final approval process with the FDA.  Similarly, a DOE grant would certainly give shareholders some confidence and perhaps help expedite NRC approval. But it wouldn’t necessarily guarantee faster NRC approval in any way.  A lack of DOE funding, while it would be very disappointing, wouldn’t be the end of LTBR or the Enfission partnership.  A DOE grant, as Seth previously stated is a bonus and yes, I too would breath easier if they got it. Nevertheless, it isn’t critical to their success. Whether they get a “funding grant” or not doesn’t in any way disprove the fuel technology. I would argue that having a large patent portfolio and a large partner like Framatome, go a long way to providing partial relief from the fear demons and gives some hope that it does indeed work!The most important event in LTBR existence will be the loading of fuel and subsequent results from the TREAT reactor in 2020 (fuel loaded in 2020 and likely TREAT reactor but any research reactor). That will provide hard data as to whether they're on the right track or not.  This would answer the first and most important question above.  Does it work as expected, is it safe?  I believe they will be beating it up in extreme conditions in a test reactor environment to define the elements’ property constraints, thresholds etc. As for Utilities, Jim Malone on previous calls has stated that while not the norm, it is feasible for Utilities to provide some funding support for this project as it is in their best interest too.  Also, they will have a by-product of saleable electricity which is what I think some partial monetary provisions would account for in the form of upfront payments. Utilities typically pay a few years in advance (I’m guessing around 3 yrs) of receiving the fuel.   As well, as per Seth in one of his interviews (Titans of Nuclear), the loaded fuel rod (LTR) for a commercial reactor will be in 4 sections of one continuous 12’ rod fused together. This will likely take place sometime in 2021.  The different areas of the rod will have different variants of composition to identify the ideal mix for the final LTA in 2023/24. The final LTA will provide electricity in a commercial reactor thereby proving that it works as expected. The timing would be 3/18 month cycles. These cycles would require payment support form the utility and these payments would be made in advance of the first load (2023/2024). Likely, upfront payments for the Lead Test Assembly (LTA 17’x17’) will be in 2020/21. Upfront payments for the Lead Test Rod (LTR) would be 2019?  On the bright side, LTBR has hired a full time executive (James Fornof) to handle government program management/submissions such as the FOA grant application for DOE funding. Furthermore, in their last filing (Form 10-Q), on page 19 it states that Mgmt will be awarded stock option grants for hitting either of the following milestones: 1) Stock price above $3 for 10 consecutive days by Dec 31, 2019; 2) securing at least $5M funding from DOE by July 2019.  Again, achievement of either milestone triggers the stock option award. I’m anticipating, roughly the following: Q1 /Q2 2019: some announcement from a US Utility to allow LTBR’s Lead test rod into their reactor in 2021 with an upfront payment in 2019. Q1/Q2 2019: announcement of an award from DOE for some funding ($1M ~ $10M). 2020: loading of fuel in a Research Reactor.  With subsequent announcements of positive results. 2021: loading of fuel rod in a Commercial Reactor.",

"Well written and well done. However, the risks as I see them are now huge. The DOE grant is now the equivalent of an FDA vote on a new drug application. LTBR moreover has only one drug in its pipeline. If Seth fails again to receive a DOE grant in March it’s lights out (no pun intended). Moreover, financial assistance from a utility prior to such a grant seems very far fetched. Utilities are highly regulated and not apt to making investments in penny stocks- especially ones who have failed to ascertain DOE grants! So it’s now or never come March. Any and all other announcements from the company I.e., additional patents, progress on fabrication, these will all amount to nothing as everyone looks to the DOE. The one exception might be a commitment from a utility to allow for testing in a commercial reactor. But similar to a direct investment in a utility, I have find it difficult to see this happening prior to the DOE grant news. Beware of the    Ides of March!!!!",

"I've been an apple user since Steve Jobs got the job back.  I live in Silicon Valley and I think this was a well written article and I agree with the conclusions but disagree with the reason.  So Apple decided they are no longer supporting the sync feature to MS machines with iTunes.  Since that is 80% there about of the market share you have now made your $1,400 dollar phone in my case its now a email and Google map device. There answer is to buy a Mac.  Oh sure there are work arounds but why spend hours to download Office 365 and then download the app just so you can get a working calendar and contacts to sync?  Don't get me started on the App store and they don't show pricing for apps just the GET button so if you find an app you think you might like you spend ten minutes entering your email and setting up a password only to find out its a subscription model.  I could name another 10 things that Apple has done to damage the relationship with its customers just this year.  Since 70 percent of Apples profit is from iPhone sales and there goal is to increase services.  Don't services only increase if you have more users?

I am on an Apple upgrade plan. I pay less for my phone each month than I do for my wireless service. And I don’t use my iPhone as a phone all that much compared to what else I do with it. If you look at the value equation Tim Cook is right. Our iPhone is very valuable to us because it does so many important things for us. And I believe we will be seeing many more from Apple. I’m glad to pay for the latest iPhone. Its speed and usability is worth a lot. By the way finger print recognition is a drag compared to face recognition.,
"I'm also a little worried, that Apple may be focusing too much on short sighted profits and margins and that Apple should continue to try hard to focus on  costumers and making the best experience for them. That's what the essence of Apple actually is and always was. But I'm sorry Crispus Nyaga, what did you say, Apple produces no in-display fingerprint like the newest OnePlus and so misses to attract new consumers? And Apple removed the popular earphone jack because they then cannot make any extra money selling additional headphones? I'm really sorry, but that's just plain nonsense.Does Apple have to adopt every new technology from the start to make good products? No. And it actually never has. Are you informed about fingerprint technology? I guess not. Do you know the difference between Apples FaceID and other face unlock systems implemented?For the headphone jack removal, this is certainly not a money making decision, but rather a strategic technology decision far beyond the iPhone. It surely is a bold one though.Please get better informed.",

Input via the touch screen works about 30% of the time unless you're just picking up the phone (then I find I have accidentally dialed someone in Singapore signed up for a Pokémon Go festival).   There are numerous design issues with this device but the most notable is the life of the battery.   I replaced the battery in it a few weeks ago because it wasn't holding a charge but now every once in a while it goes from 50% charge level to 0 and shuts off.   At the 3 year mark, I know it's time to buy a new phone but I'd rather do it thinking will be an upgrade to a more capable devise (vs a necessary replacement for a failing device).

"Here is a story that touches the lives of millions!!! Apple has a new nation-wide BATHROOM policy!! Now bathrooms are available only to employees. After waiting for an hour to pay $1000 for an iPhone X, customers are told that a bathroom is not available but (at the Palm Desert store) you can use the restroom at Starbucks across the street. As Apple turns away from it’s famous loyal customers, Starbucks must pay the price. The explanation is that employees are inconvenienced by waiting in line for access and may be late for teaching a class or miss selling a phone. There is always Starbucks across the street!! At Apple there are often 50 customers waiting for a salesperson, waiting for a class to start, waiting for the Genius Bar or browsing for over-priced accessories while a restroom is unavailable to them. A great method to lose some of their incredible customer loyalty but none of the managers seemed to be interested in the blowback from customers.

"Surely a massive addition to SB's value is it's stake in the management co of the Vision Fund.  I don't know the fee structure, but if it's typical for a VC or PE fund, then, given that the fund is huge ($100bn), then the fees and carried interest being earned from it by SB must also be huge if it performs well.  If so, then there is huge additional value there for SB.  Have you looked at this?",

"I’ve seen all sorts of share price predictions from bulls and bears. Some are ridiculously high and some ridiculously low. Does anyone know what the range of SP is for publicly traded companies with between $4-5B in annual revenue, which is about the expected revenue for Aurora if they meet their production goals within the next couple of years? One could then adjust those SP for the # of outstanding shares so some sort of comparison could be made to Aurora. Yes, I know that so many other variables affect the SP, but I’d love to see some ballpark range",
"@Jonathan Weber ""The company had operating expenses of $120 million during Q1, which equates to operating expenses of $480 million a year. If Aurora Cannabis wants to break even during the coming year, the company will have to generate gross profits of $480 million""I note that you didn't mention the increase in opex over the previous quarter of about $50m.I would contend that the company probably used a good part of that $50m in gearing up for the 17th October legalisation  date. If that is indeed the case, then I would expect opex to decrease somewhat over the next few quarters -- in absolute terms and not just as a percentage. I agree that success in the recreational market will prove to be crucial in generating meaningful returns on capital. Anecdotal reports on the sales figures from, for example, Shopify seem to indicate that Aurora's various brands are capturing significant market share already. I would think this augurs well for the company in achieving the targets you have cited. My gut feeling tells me that the current quarter's (Q2 19) earnings report will be something of an eye-opener. As their new facilities come on stream in the near future and productivity is strengthened, cost to produce is lowered and ASPs don't fall while operational expenses are slightly reduced, there should be no trouble in achieving a gross profit somewhere near your figure -- perhaps even more.Good luck everybody and hang on to your hats...:-)AragornDisclosure: Long ACB, APHA, HEXO",

"While the company is powerful and strong a few things to note. With such a strong share in cloud services the chances are the company has more to lose than to gain in market share. However, the business should grow none the less. Additionally, if we are going to get a true idea of value and do some quick math. If the company can turn $225 billion in sales into a 10% after tax profit, the company would be offering $22.5 billion in profit versus a $750 billion valuation. The company would still be trading in other words at close to a 30x p/e. I will be honest. I think 10% is more than fair. As a seller on amazon, I have seen what they are willing to drive their profit levels down to in order to be the cheapest on the platform for the items they fulfill. They also offer services like fulfillment which is a 12% fee plus some handling, however, I would expect by the time they are done they maintain about a 5-6% profit for handling this. The retail pressure is significant and is starting to become more competitive by the likes of Walmart and Target. This will continue to keep margins low.

@Jonathan Cooper:  What is your opinion of the Super/Multi shares held by the executives that multiply by a factor of 100  to result in a fully diluted share count of 110million? I can see that you have taken this in to account with their current market cap of around 1 billion USD (now it is 880 million). But it still seems a lot for a one-state operator. If you compare with for example Liberty Health that has a roughly 1/4 of the market cap of Truelieve. My opinion of companies with super-voting shares like Truelieve and Curaleaf is that I don't want to have anything to do with them!

Hamish - thanks for the article. Do you have any thoughts on VGR?,
I am long MO and PM.  Like those dividends.,
"Wow, there are a lot of MO enthusiasts here. Let me be the skeptic of the group by wondering whether this stock is a value buy or a value trap.  In short, it’s too early to tell.All the graphs in the world (and in this article) will not tell us which direction MO will go in future. They tell us only what MO has done in the past, and that (as we all know) is no guarantee of future performance.  If we are looking for stocks we expect to keep for the long term, then we must be convinced that MO will be able to contend with the increasingly-hostile environment of government regulation in the USA.As a general comment on the financial metrics, MO seems to be able to produce decent EPS stats  -- so far -- despite generally-declining revenue. Eventually such manoeuvres will be like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.  A company must make money (top line revenue) at some point, because cost cutting, share buybacks and the like cannot boost EPS forever. So, I remain unconvinced that MO is a long-term hold, at least until I see better revenue numbers.  What reason do investors have to hope for better revenue?  Some  investors pin their hopes on “pricing and iQOS” (to use the author’s words).   While it is true that current smokers seem willing to pay whatever price they must to get their fix, this market will eventually die out – if not due to cancer, then due to old age. That leaves MO investors with the hope that iQOS will fill the gap for new smokers. This is not at all certain.  And I read somewhere that  e-cigarettes are suspected of depositing metal into lungs!! Now there’s a risk that would put the boots to all expectations of future revenue. Furthermore, PM’s experience abroad is cautionary.  While e-cigarettes have provided a bigger share of sales for PM, in foreign countries, those sales have not boosted share price. Look at a price chart for the past 2-3 years, and see that MO and PM have gone up and down in tandem. So can we rest assured that MO’s  share price will rise along with increasing iQOS sales? I remain unconvinced, unless and until MO starts posting better revenue numbers.I know, the stronger US dollar has depressed PM's share price when expressed in USD, but it's very unlikely that the depressing effect of currency exchange rates perfectly counterbalanced the boost of rising e-cigarette sales for PM, resulting in an almost-perfect matching of share prices. So again, we just cannot have confidence that MO is a stock for the long term, not yet anyway.",

Who would bet against it - seriously.  SO what if you wipe out 2000 shares?  Lick your wound.  What if the company recovers and climbs into the teens with you adding shares 50 or 100 at a time?SO - now you know my strategy.",
"First balanced article i’ve read in weeks. The pile on negatives of the so called”financial analysts” are just as disingenuous as the cheering squad mentality  that accompanied one disastrous decision after another between 2015  and 2018 by Immelt and his merry men. Imagine the state of GE if the stock buy backs, the purchase of Alstom, the deal with BHI and the 5B squandered on IofT software and business development didn’t occur. GE would have between 50 and 60B more cash, power wouldn’t be saddled with the Alstom poison pill, software people wouldn’t  be laid off and while oil and gas would be still having problems, it is questionable whether the extent of loss would be as big as that suffered by the BHGE new company stock. Making the bad decisions was compounded by appointing unqualified managers to manage power and BHGE. As far as I can discern, Culp has recognized the management shortfalls in power and the potential of adequately servicing the installed gas turbine fielded base. The announced reorganization strikes me as the first tangible move to turn that business around. The acceleration of monetizing the oil and gas stock holdings also seems to me that Culp recognizes that this business’ growth prospects are limited and the stock will probably not appreciate. The deal he has made seems to preserve the ability to provide power plant products to the new company while realizing some cash back earlier than first negotiated. I believe that it is a clever move even though the stock is significantly lower than first issued.In short, I see Culp making some positive first moves. Now if he finds a way to keep healthcare, I will be even more positive about his ability to turn the company around.",
I just sold all of my GE and I never sell anything.  I only buy blue-chips and drip the dividends.     Intelligent suggestions on what stock(s) I should purchase in this market as a long term replacement please.  Thank you.,
"Ah yes, a line of credit.  I wonder who are the poor fools that extended such to GE. More to the point, how easily could they turn around and revoke said line of credit?  (On the theory of why throw good money after bad?) In which case bankruptcy becomes far more likely.  I happen to be long on GE, mostly for tax reasons, my cost bases being too low considering that the stock has been in the family for a century and came my way before the laws changed that allowed a step-up of the cost basis.  Definitely the dog of my portfolio.  Luckily most of my net worth is elsewhere (AAPL, MO, PM, PEP, NEE etc.).",

"I'm long ago out of GE, and yet I cringe as I watch a (formerly) great American company suffer from years of mismanagement. Its value melting away like an ice cube left in the sun--a little at first, and then a lot. The house that Jack built from 1981 to 2001, and Jeff ruined from 2001 to 2017, may be beyond repair, and is burdened by its costly mistakes. There was a period some 50-years ago, when conglomerates were thought attractive for combining disparate businesses having different business cycles. That notion has proven wrong, and most have disappeared, including Ling-Temco-Vought, ITT Corporation, Litton Industries, Textron, and Teledyne.*That GE is unlikely to be bankrupt is damning with faint praise--in no way does that equate to an attractive investment opportunity. IMO, General Electric's corporate name has been so thoroughly soiled over so many years, I'd prefer it separate its successful divisions into 3 new and re-named companies (i.e., aviation, healthcare, and energy), each with their own management and BoD focused upon its mission, so each has an opportunity to attract capital and become successful new companies. Rich-unck:12hrs* BTW, another of the last conglomerates, UTX announced it is breaking itself into 3 companies (aerospace, elevator, & air conditioning).",

Long GE and buying more,
"And then, suddenly, the world realized it needs more electricity.",
"I've recently bought a very small amount of GE, in the high $7 range. It's a throw-away position; if I lose, then I lose. GE is more like a lottery ticket than an investment, right now. (Yes, I know that's an exaggeration, but not a big exaggeration). Question: Why can't GE sell their GE Capital business and just keep the manufacturing businesses that make real stuff? That's what made them into what they were, before JW and JI bastardized them.",
"Jack Welch left GE with high valuation and lots of well-hidden structural problems.  Immelt turned up to be as incompetent as they come - repeatedly buying high (including GE's stock) and selling low and the hiding of the problems continued.  If you think about it, it's a true statement of company's strength and Immelt's salesmanship that it took him as long as it did to bring GE to its current sorry state after such a wrong bets that rivals all capital misallocations in human history.  If you just removed one, like Alstom purchase, Baker Hughes, or just the buyback, there would not be any discussion about GE's capital structure.The story is always the same - debt.  Everybody cheers when times are good, as ""somebody else's money"" make the cash for the equity investors.  When times get tight, it all collapses, nearly overnight.  The problem with GE is that many of those liabilities were consistently unrecognized, if not intentionally hidden from the equity investors. I think Immelt should be brought to justice, but it won't solve anything for GE.  The investor lawsuits will only make current investors pay the bills to the lawyers.   So what now?  I honestly do not know...  I think Culp is a masochist.  No money in the world is worth this kind of swamp.",
"I'm confused. Total balance sheet liabilities are $263,468 million, plus the insurance and related liabilities of $76,000 million, and the pension liabilities of $23,000 million comes to a grand total of $322,468 million in liabilities.GE's reports total assets of $311,691 million. Of this, $60,377 is goodwill - basically amounts that GE overpaid for its various failed acquisitions. Goodwill cannot be sold, traded, or monetized in any way - it's simply phantom money that no longer exists. So, the actual assets that GE can sell or use are worth $251,314. If we subtract GE's balance sheet and off balance sheet liabilities from it's total assets - MINUS the goodwill, we see that GE 's debts exceed its assets by an astonishing $71,154 billion. Which, I note, substantially exceeds the entire market cap for all of GE. WOWZERS. Why doesn't this strongly imply that GE if GE's liquidity dries up, it's going to be insolvent? I will note that the credit default swap market is trading at levels suggesting that bankruptcy is one probable outcome. The rapidly declining stock price does not make this company a bargain. In this case, the stock market is actually getting it right - and so is the credit default swap market. GE should absolutely be regarded as a potentially worthless stock, and with this large a negative net worth, I can't fathom why the shares should be worth anything even close to $7 a share.I could be wrong, and the stock might rally from here. But if GE goes bankrupt it will not come as a big surprise to me.",

"GE is an invention of what happens when managers try to run an industrial business like a financial business, and become too much in thrall to the headlong pursuit of shareholder value (which GE’s former chief executive Jack Welch, long an ardent exponent, later repudiated as “the dumbest idea in the world”).While GE has long had strategic problems, its immediate troubles today are around a credit crunch (e.g. debt will always catch up to you).Financial engineering is not the same as real engineering.

"OK, this article has *major* conceptual problems and it basically a pangloss load of bull.  If the conclusion is correct which is still might be, it cannot be for any of the reasons given.  For starters though the writer says ""a high debt load in absolute terms, but there is a significant portion of assets on the company's balance sheet as well.""Um, assets and liabilities always balance as an accounting identity, it is just that the liability side includes an equity entry.  But the equity entry of what is left to the common assumes that *everything* on the asset side is worth the full value it is carried at, which is generally what was actually paid for something.  Now the biggie -The GE balance sheet includes *$80 billion of intangible assets* on the asset side, plus about $20 billion in ""contract assets"" aka future payments expected but not in hand.  Assuming the latter are all completely sound, that intangibles total is still well above the $48 billion in equity at book on the liability side of the sheet.  $32 billion more than it, in fact.  This means GEs *tangible* net worth is minus $32 billion.The writer doesn't see this because he pretends only about half the liabilities on the sheet are ""debt"", and then it highlights the a liquid third or so on the asset side and pretends they offset the debts.  Um, offsetting the debt with the assets is what the *entire balance sheet* is doing, and it is leaving a minus $32 billion hole, when one accounts for ""goodwill"" and ""other intangible assets"" being accounting entries for payment of things for more than their book value, not cash anything or real asset anything.Then the author also says ""GE isn't spending much on capital expenditures right now"", when in fact their capex is slightly above their entire operating cash flow.  Their owner earnings, defined as operating cash flow minus the cap ex needed to keep their businesses running and that operating cash flow coming in, is *negative*, though basically at break even.  It is thus *not available for paying down debt*.",

Thanks for explaining the liability story.  You make a good case as to why GE will go lower from here.,
"Just a footnote: when interest rates rise, pension liabilities in general decrease. Though the pension plan asset values (mainly fixed income) decrease also. The net effect is difficult to predict, depends quite a bit of asset-liability mismatch and the used calculation parameters of the pension plan (mortality rates used, discount rate, wage increase rate etc.)",
"Silly to think there will be any form of a merger. GE will continue to piddle along for a few years, selling off assets as they go along, then at some point, GE will file for bankruptcy, moving the pension liabilities to the PGC , i.e., the federal government..",
"I don’t any merger talk is relevant in 2018. GE will bottom out & the vultures will pick at its carcass. Why buy them as the value is going down? GE just sold segments of their business that just 2 years ago were probably valued 40% higher. GE is trying weather the storm but once Moody’s does the RIGHT thing of another downgrade, it will be harder for GE to find additional financing at reasonable rates. This credit line they can draw down I am going to question on the validity of them being able to draw on it in its entirety. During the financial crisis, banks reduced HELOC’s limits without notice to their borrowers. 100k lines with 25k balances were reduced to 25 without notice. I am a mortgage banker so I saw it with my own eyes. FICO scores went from 740 to under 700 because the debt went from 25% usage to 100% maxed out. If this credit line “can” at any point be reduced, then GE would be in even worse shape than it is now. I am not a commercial lender so I don’t know the terms nor the relationship they have with the lender but it seems if the rate in which they can draw no longer fits the risk and the lender feels like they may go into bankruptcy, BONDS get paid first. This is why everyone is saying if you are going to invest in GE, by the bonds. Bankruptcy would wipe out share holders pennies on the dollar. He can say they are not close to bankruptcy all he wants but the truth is, they are bleeding have been bleeding and these sales does not stop the bleeding it is simply kicking down the road the inevitable, a Moody’s downgrade, stock price will dip to $6 or less and like Buffett did with Bank of America, some white night will come in and give them cash for huge amounts of stocks and warrants putting them in first lien over all retail investors. Why would anyone take the risk? Under 8$ looks cheap but until it gets to $2 or less, I am staying away from it.",

"jtizo  BINGO!This what I have been saying all along, and 	Dhierin Bechai, who thinks he knows everything, criticized me on two occasions for premature opinions and essentially called me uninformed and stating nonsense.I have spoken directly with  a  737NG pilot (which Dhierin Bechai didn't believe since he asked me for his name, which I would not divulge due to privacy reasons). I have also chatted with a 737 MAX pilot on ""Mentour Pilot"" YouTube channel and mobile app. Both these pilots said the same thing as you. What in the world kind of training, or common sense competence did the Lion Air pilots have? Whether they knew about the MCAS (which could have been posted in the manual) or not, spinning trim wheels that move by themselves meant some sort of anti stall program took control due to a disagree in sensors data and an impending stall (real or not). The remedy on most all 737's, is the STAB TRIM CUTOUT switch which is red, labelled, near the pilots peripheral eye view on the aisle console, and in some models with a bright red light on the switch.Since Dhierin Bechai, writes all these articles on BA, he thinks he knows everything. Like myself, he is not a pilot.",
"So I am going to quote a description of the stall protection system on a 737 NG from their manual and ask if someone can explain how this is different the. The NG. I fly a 767 and we have a shaker but no pitching system. However the procedures for an unreliable airspeed and or AOA disagree as well as a runaway stab trim are the same.  It says ""The EFS module increases hydraulic pressure to the elevator feel And centering unit during a stall.  This increases forward control column Force to approximately 4 times normal feel pressure.""  Then ""As airspeed decreases towards the stall speed, the speed trim system trims the stabilizer nose down and enables trim above stickshaker AOA.  With this schedule the pilot must pull more aft column to stall the plane.  With the column aft, the amount of column force increase with the onset of the EFS module is more pronounced."" When I read this definition it sound exactly like MCAS. Honesty, as a pilot if you are holding 100 lbs of pressure on the yoke to keep the plane level, and it does this 26 times during the space of a 13 minute flight, how could you not consider the possibility the trim was running. Not only can you feel the nose pitching but you can see the wheels turning right next to where your sitting. Several other crews figured it out. Why was this crew so poorly trained?",

"New Guy Here.. Enjoyed the article and agree that accidents are most often attributed to a chain of events. My background is as a career USAF Eagle Keeper (F-15), logistics support therefore, and F-22 Operational Test and Evaluation. Within, I have an extensive quality background and hold an MBA in Aviation; my passion. I have witnessed F-15 crashes, launched one that did not return, and avidly follow accidents like this one.The point on Boeing's failure to disclose the MCAS system to its operators and the FAA's failure to force is disheartening and negligent as is Boeing's comment to avoid ""Flooding"" information to its operators. Hogwash..! That's why pilots are pilots; they handle it. As a fighter jet maintainer and tester such a statement is akin to not disclosing additional capabilities of a fighter to ITS operators.Boeing made a similarly ridiculous comment by analogically comparing the KC-46A's rate of (So-Called) ""Undetected"" [Refueling Boom - Aircraft] errant contacts to ""Detected"" errant contacts of current USAF tankers. It happens. Refueling booms have caused significant damage to F-15 aircraft as the midair refueling operation is inherently very dangerous. However, on the KC-135 and KC-10, the boom operator is laying on or sitting on the refueling boom housing respectively and will immediately ""Feel"" the errant contact. The KC-46A boomer is up front with the pilots and the sense of feel is thereby lost. Boeing tried to normalize the system's deficiency. As testers, we were all OVER the Raptor's aircraft systems and logistics infrastructure deficiencies, did our best to hold the manufacturer accountable, and forced many significant, positive changes. Maybe the FAA should have a Test and Evaluation function.. There was tremendous pressure in certifying the F-22A's Initial Operating Capability, but we held our own and made it a better acquisition. Anyway, great intro to aerodynamic forces and aircraft systems leading to a potential root cause. As described, the accident seems similar to a spatial disorientation accident as the aircraft and its operator(s) sense differently and and react inversely. Thank you for the opportunity to comment. --> Richard",
While we may never have the exact cause of Lion Air disaster more and more it looks like  maintenance failures at the carrier are being highlighted. Abysmal records and even possibility of used or rebuilt part. BA should have very limited liability. BA could recover to 340 very quickly.,
"I have read about many air disasters and learn something from each one. Your article advanced my knowledge about flight dynamics and I found it very interesting. One thing I keep wondering: where is the redundancy of multiple systems that I thought was so prevalent in airliner design? Three AoA sensors could be employed as independent inputs and the system would act on the average of those readings. If SD went out of range (due to widely different data among the three sensors ) the system would throw an alert and/or disengage. I have seen this scheme used on medical diagnostics equipment to ensure the veracity of measurements.As for the impact of this tragedy on BA's long term performance, I have observed that the public has a very short memory of such events and eventually whatever effect the incident had diminishes to nothing.",

Hopefully the cockpit voice recordings will be recovered soon, and give the investigators the insight they need to make a definitive determination of the facts.What we *do* know is that the worst case scenario looks to have already been factored into the stock price, and this represents a buying opportunity for a stock that a few weeks ago was showing a gorgeous balance sheet, and those fundamentals have not changed.",
"Nice article, Sir.Thanks for giving a detailed description of the functioning/ control system of the aircraft.

I have been reading your articles for about three years now, and I find it hard to believe that you are an undergraduate.Do keep up the good work. Expecting more and more beautiful articles from your end.",
"I totally disagree with the assessment in this article. I fly Boeing aircraft and understand the design philosophy and procedures involved in Boeing designs. I think people want to try to blame Boeing when the real fault lies with mismanaged maintenance and poor pilot training at Lion Air, along with a lack of basic CRM skills and common sense.  First of all, everything that was needed for this crew to survive these malfunctions was outlined in their Pilot QRH checklists.  Unreliable airspeed and the procedures to survive the problem are outlined in the emergency checklists.  However let's take this from a common sense point of view. We know this aircraft had a history of airspeed problems and that those problems were on the Captain's Pitot static Air Data computers. All of the maintenance work was done on the Captains systems.  The 737, and pretty much all Boeing aircraft have two separate and redundant air data systems hooked up to their respective and separate autopilots.  They also have a 3rd separate standby system in the case both Air Data computers fail as a side note.  A professional crew would have looked at the maintenance logbooks and noted an airspeed problem on the Captain's system with no history of any problems on the FO's system. A smart Captain would then likely look at the QRH for unreliable airspeed before even taking off, where they would read that if you have an unreliable airspeed and or an AOA disagree message you must initially turn off the automation, identify the malfunctioning system and then activate the autopilot on the side of the good Air Data system.  Those three steps would have saved this crew from a malfunction they created for themselves by not understanding how the autopilot and air data systems actually work on their plane. While the logbook past write ups does not guarantee a problem will come back or the problem was fixed, it would give the crew at least a perception of potential issues they may have come along with the ability to look at the procedure and prepare for the potential problem.  If I am a Captain on a jet with a history of airspeed and air data malfunctions on my Captains instruments, I would likely have the FO fly the plane, knowing his/her systems had no history of malfunctions to at least see if the problem came back.  The point is, if the airspeed and AOA are malfunctioning on system one, all you have to do is use system two, and that bad data is separated out from the autopilot system.  So you have no basic knowledge of the Air Data systems or autopilot from this crew, and poor CRM for not identifying a potential issue from the problems of four previous crews.  So this crew; not recognizing the procedures for problem number one ""airspeed, and AOA disagree"" created control problem number two with the MCAS. Before I even go into detail on this false narrative about the ""special new and undescribed system"" it says that the 737 NG also has an almost identical system to what is on the MAX. It's called something else with a different acronym but the 737 NG also has a system that trims the nose down when the aircraft is approaching the stall regime. While the MAX was new to the company, all of these Lion Air pilots had flown the 737 NG. And that version also has stall protection that trims the nose down when approaching a stall AOA.  Both aircraft types create artificial Force on the pitch controls to try to prevent the pilot from pitching into a stall AOA.  So I do not buy the argument that one aircraft was substantially different from the newer version regarding stall protection. Either way, a stab trim runaway is also a procedure in the QRH that most pilots have memorized because it can kill you in certain conditions.  All these articles conveniently fail to mention or bring up the fact that this crew fought these pitchovers for 13 minutes before they crashed,  It was not one isolated pitchover. The data quoted in this article suggests it happened at least three times on this flight.  The malfunction is exactly the same as just about any run away stab trim scenario. When you fly the plane by hand, if the nose gets heavy and pitches towards the ground, you pull against it, you trim against it and then you activate the trim cutouts and trim the plane manually with the wheels.  How this crew had multiple pitchovers while pulling back on the yoke with 100 lbs of pressure, without even considering cutting of the trim system absolutely amazes me. Whether MCAS was described in depth or not, as a crew you would have seen the trim wheels spinnning when you weren't trimming and I think would have likely been a fantastic clue bird into the fact the trim system was operating without a desired pilot input.  That doesn't mean that Boeing should not have given an overview of MCAS, but I personally don't think knowing about that system or not would have made any difference in the outcome of this crash,  Everything that was needed to get this plane safely back on the ground was already written in the QRH.  Did this crew fail to even use the emergency procedures before the crash?   That would be one of the questions I would like to see answered.",
"Dhierin Bechai,The Lion Air crash was a tragedy for the souls lost and the families. I will say a prayer for them,This is a very good article from the standpoint of you, a trained person in the know. I will wait to see what the report has to say regarding my investment in BA.Glad to hear that you feel it will not totally kill future Boeing  737 MAX business unless a major overhaul is required.I always felt that the cause of this crash was a composite of causes, with the main cause  buried in the finer details of A + B + C + D, where the letter order has not yet been determined.The cause is somewhere in the sequence of events and timeline where  A=Hardware and software, B=Maintenance, C= Pilot and training and D= Documentation",
"The article was excellent. I do not agree with those who thought it was too long. The standard principles when designing aircraft are to design in redundancies for systems, like AoA sensors, and margins of safety, like a structural component X% stronger and fatigue cycles X% higher than needed. For example if you have three AOA sensors and one starts sending erroneous data, the system can automatically ignore the wrong data. It would take 2 of the three sensors failing in the same way to result in an overall system failure.",

"These comments are 80% congratulation. I wonder why that happens. People with nothing to say just wanna see their name in print, I guess. Regarding the length of this article, without unnecessarily driving home the fact that he studied aero, the author could have focused on the fact that there is a toggle available to shut this system off, and ultimately the pilots are responsible to know it is there. Further, there is I think something more reprehensible about people being killed by an automated system, as opposed to the human errors these systems are designed to control.",
"Thank you for the excellent report. Personally, I like long detailed reports much more than short superficial reports.   Have built and flown my own plane so familiar with simple basic flight controls and trim. Always thought that all nonmilitary aircraft should be stable enough to be flown by pilots with all computer controls turned off. I have a friend who flies airliners and says he worries about losing his basic stick and rudder skills since the computer flies the plane most of the time. Compulsive guy rents a Cessna every couple of months to help keep his basic flying skills current. One of the commenters mentioned the lack of pilot skill in some accidents related to computers flying the planes. No problem till the computer can't fly the plane. Just review Air France flight 444, bad Air Bus design and poor pilot skill.Hopefully BA will learn from this and keep the pilots in the loop.",
"Great article, Dhierin.  I am not an engineer, but I do have a private pilot license, unfortunately inactive for far too many years now (it's an expensive hobby).  I understood it pretty well.  And while I certainly appreciate the human tragedy and pain caused by this crash; I am also looking for an investment entry point in BA.  Thank you.",
"For those who fly, imagine you have done a takeoff from a runway, climbing, cleaning-up, accelerating, turning on course to a way-point, completing after-take-off checklist and the aircraft starts auto-trimming nose down for 10 seconds, you control with nose-up input and wonder what happened and again there is nose down trim  and again with stall warning and other warnings of speed, altitude disagree and you reach a stage where all your pulling on the control column has no effect, you fight the trim and the nose down forces with no effect and splash!!!!! (you have trained for run-away trim but this is not a run-away just regular intermittent trim with stall warning and many more warnings with the glare-shield and cockpit lit-up like Christmas Tree)In Airbus vs Boeing (pilot's perspective) pilots liked the Boeing philosophy of keeping it simple and need to know information in the AFM and Checklist, but that philosophy and attitude was alright in the days of pulleys and cable controls. As more and more automation is incorporated the pilot is left out of the loop of new additions to the old systems and this Lion Air is one serious case in point. The other one comes to mind is the Midlands crash where Boeing changed the aircondioning system to the cabin and cockpit and resulting in wrong cues that were picked-up by the pilot and lives were lost. (One of the contributory causes).",
What a terrific report.  Have you analyzed other crashes?,
"Re: EJ DutchinLA, and many other commenters, and , of course, the author:Thanks to all for sharing your real life experiences and knowledge of aircrafts and actually flying them in some cases.So many people curse regulations, and in a sample of cases , rightly so.And the bad and obsolete ones should be eliminated.But, at the same time, I never saw a crook that liked legitimate regulations.It would be my guess that all the dead passengers would like to have seen enough regulations required to prevent the accident, esp. after problems were previously encountered, ""if"" they were around to express their concerns..Maybe we should consider this when we hear others deride regulations and hear the politicians promise to reduce or eliminate them in order to gain political favor.",
"Superb report.  We also look forward to the forthcoming episode of ""Air Disasters"" that features the Lion Air Flight 610 investigation.",
"In my humble opinion safety margins are continuously getting smaller to make planes use less fuel by reducing aerodynamic loads and weight. The 73 MAX has a decreased tailplane, smaller surface than you would expect, reason is saves fuel but also reduces the control-ability in the sense of safety margins. Just as the author stated, more additional computer control systems are put in place to control an inherent unstable aircraft. Not saying the 73 MAX is inherent unstable like fighter planes, but definitely less stable than previous generation planes, just to save more fuel. A great example is the MD11, a re modified DC10 design. To save fuel, the manufacturer choose to make the tailplane surface(stabilizer) smaller, meaning you have less control surface to control the pitch in the ac. So they installed some computerized augmentation systems to make it safer and more controllable. I flew this plane for many years and came to find out what it meant to have less pitch control than previous ac.As an airline pilot(28 years) I flew some other jets that had control surfaces properly sized to the ac, giving it sufficient controllability, even in extreme situations.Now you have to rely more on augmented computer controlled systems to achieve that controllability, just to save cost, majority fuel cost.This makes it (much)harder for pilots to understand how the ac will respond in degraded situations, especially when this system is not mentioned in the manuals and therefore not know to pilots.This is a worrying issue, I myself have been trained on 8 different jets and found the information given to pilots is becoming less and less. You get to know the ""basics"" about the systems and come to found out years later through maintenance issues that the ac has systems you never knew off.Airplanes are now truly complicated machines with so many computer interacting and relying on inputs modified by computers.In this crash the pilots were dealing with erroneous confusing instrument readings AND a system malfunction(stab trim) that the were never trained on and did not exist in their manuals, kept out by Boeing.It seems that it is possible for the stab trim to continuously trim the ac pitch down so far that the pilots do not have enough control authority through the elevators to keep the nose up, simply stated the pilot cannot get the nose up anymore to override the nose down trim action.THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE if that is the case.The race to save more fuel is a trade off to aircraft stability and is overcome by installing computer controlled augmentation systems.I much rather be in command of my jet(with hundreds of pax) where I have plenty of control surface so the pilot is ultimately ALWAYS in command if systems fail, and not computers.The future of aviation is now only focused on cost savings, and is giving control more and more to computers making it much harder for pilots to understand how the ac would respond in a degraded situation.",
"Actually I dont think the share price of BA demonstrates the level of risk to BA.BA shares are still priced about where they were at the start of the year. One can suggest that multiple causes exist for the crash. However most of the causes relate back to higher risk for BA shareholders.Without trying to take a position on BA fault I can suggest that BA profits are likely impacted. Whether it is legal damages, a failed system(s), improper training, cancellations or lack of new orders, or aircraft redesign costs, risks abound for investors even now.One cant help but wonder if an airline(s) would refuse to take delivery of the new 737 until answers emerge? As an investor BA is not worth a full economic valuation at this time. That said BA will get thru this issue and is a great company.",
"Could be something as simple as an intermittent wiring problem .i.e. a short or open caused by flight stress, temperature, or altitude, etc,.Causes for electronics failures, including the sensor itself, are so numerous that they are almost impossible to list, including mechanical failures like ""lifted contact pins"" on electronic modules that create an open circuit under flight or other stresses.Contamination, oxidation, that only appear under certain conditions of temperature and humidity, etc.Most people look at an aircraft and see a fuselage, two wings/engines, rudder and stabilizers, etc.What I see is underneath the skin and represents thousands/millions of potential points of failure.Let's just hope we get the truth of the matter after all is said and done.",
"Great article, as always.",
"The more complex the control system, the more complicated the manual interface which increases the probability of incorrect pilot responses either through misunderstanding or confusion under stress. Similar to the nuclear industry, simulator training should cover all operational and failure modes of the control system concurrent with ongoing emergency scenarios especially during takeoff and landing. I suspect this is done to some extent. As long as a plane is capable of flying, a pilot can keep it flying if he is in control. Immediately recognizing the correct actions required to maintain or regain control can only be acquired thru extensive simulator training. As suggested in the article, it is likely a series of events, circumstance and design features inexplicable came together at the wrong moment to cause the crash. People want to point the figure at one specific thing, but it usually isn't that simple. Makes you think twice about vehicles speeding down the interstate on autonomously. What king of training are drivers going to have if they have to take control?",
"I put this one strictly on maintenance and schedule.. the airdata system experienced a failure, and repair action was performed that cleared the fault without a subsequent comprehensive  ramp test to verify successful replacement of the faulty component. I don't have enough information yet to know if the fault lies solely with a sensor, or a combination of sensor failure and fault monitoring system - software data logging/reporting can be misleading as to actual cause of failure.Additionally, the flight-control system software can mask the actual problem while trying to compensate for it, leaving the cockpit crew responding to the compensations of the FCS instead of the dynamics of the aircraft flight profile - this is what the author has focused on, based largely on the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, ground radar data, etc, and the cockpit crew desperately tried to make sense out of the contradictory information the instruments were telling them. It's quite possible that the crew became engrossed in this effort and 'forgot to fly the plane"" - a bit of hyperbole but with a component of truth - pilots are taught to believe their instruments even when their ""outside cues"" of body sensation (vertigo) and visuals (it was a morning flight so one can assume - with attendant risks of that assumption - they had some visual horizon and ground/sea proximity indications had they been looking outside).So, I concluded weeks ago that the cause of the flight loss was an improperly diagnosed sensor system (duh) combined with confusing / ambiguous information presented to the flight crew. While the max is very similar to the previous versions of the 737, it is not the same, and that ""similar but different"" aspect is likely where the devil was residing.Disclaimer - I was involved in design and certification of the communication system on the 737 max.",
"db...another amazing analysis but maybe too long.  Any way you view this, this incident will be a drag on BOEING.....the question is...to what extent. It is the complexity of the issue that works against Boeing whether the accident was their fault or not.  Everybody wants to bottom-line an issue in five or less sentences and you can’t do that with this issue so nobody will take the time to understand that Boeing may not be at fault. It is easier to assign blame versus trying to understand a complex problem.",
"good for trial lawyers and litigants but you should really be hoping for Chinese aircraft,  you complain there, you disappear. No muss no fuss, lol.",
"Wow. This sentence leapt out at me:""It also shows that while the Boeing 737 concept has been there for decades, from an aerodynamic stability point of view, it is meeting its limits and after the Boeing 737 MAX there should come a clean-sheet design which has the required aerodynamic stability built into the design or has robust augmentation systems.""Very damning. Boeing's cheapness and willingness to repeatedly go back to the well on a 50 year-old airframe, instead of going with a clean sheet design, could be finally be costing lives.",
"Very well done.  As an industry guy, I understand the difficulty of describing what is going on while teaching people the language we use at the same time.  The depth and complexity of this ""incident"" virtually eliminates the ability of ""Soundbite Reporters"" to do it justice.  I like you await the report because this is a pretty good example of ""You dont know what you dont know"".  As far as criticisms for the piece being too long, they chose to ""not get it"". I wouldn't let their voices bother you too much.",
"While some of the technical details were above my level of aeronautical design comprehension, I now feel much more knowledgeable in aircraft design and why the flight might have crashed. What I continue to wonder about is why this problem didn't occur or be reported in the numerous other 737MAX flights. Did it not happen, were the pilots more experienced and could handle it, or was it unreported by the other pilots who did experience but overcame the problem?",
"Some interesting facts but many misstatements, surprising for an aerospace professional.  Achieving pitch stability through a combination of slight nose heaviness balanced by horizontal stabilizer down force is not difficult to achieve nor a new concept, it's how aircraft have been stabilized since the Wright flyer.  And certainly no transport aircraft is designed to be inherently unstable, that's reserved only for military aircraft requiring extreme maneuvering capability.   As far as the accident goes, the aircraft entered a condition known as ""runaway stabilizer"" in which some malfunction caused the horizontal stabilizer to move into an extreme trim condition.  Knowing exactly what system is causing or contributing to this malfunction is irrelevant to the pilot.  The pilot needs only to recognize the condition and take the steps to correct it, namely cut power to the trim system and adjust the trim manually.  All pilots are trained to do this as a part of their type certification training. Certainly the pilots may have been distracted by the cacophony of warning tones and alert messages that bombard a pilot  whenever a modern aircraft experiences a hardware malfunction.  But they were already trained to recognize and deal with a runaway stabilizer condition, the tragedy is that they were unable, for whatever reasons, carry out their training.",

I have one additional 'if' suggestion for your list:If the crew would have reviewed the logs of the previous crew, they might have been made aware of how the issue was successfully dealt with in the penultimate flight, the accident might not have occurred.  Of course, the assumption is that crews document issues after their flight for later crews to review in this manner.From previous media reports I have read, this aircraft exhibited problems with trim stability for three flights before the one that crashed.  How/why did Lion Air's maintenance fail to fix the issue after three tries?  Is it in their procedures to contact Boeing for help with unsolved issues such as this?  For something as serious and recurrent as this is it unreasonable to take an aircraft out of service until it could be properly diagnosed and repaired?",

Thank you for a great article. I fly alot and for some reason I always prefer the Airbus planes more quiet and comfortable...

For me it is clearly the responsibility of the manufacturer.,

"Long but thorough..  I didn't read thoroughly so forgive if I repeat something.  A friend works at Boeing and said it was a software problem - if the computer sees two different readings for AOA, it should have noted the difference and warned the pilots of either a stall or sensor error instead of taking the plane down.Anything that grabs control of the plane should warn the pilots what's going on ASAP.  Boeing should have told pilots about MCAS and how to disable it, especially when it's capable of taking the plane down quickly.  If the MAX 8 had a tendency to stall (because of engine placement), pilots should have been told how to deal with it, especially if correcting a MAX 8 is different - pilots are capable of dealing with a stall, but not fighting against computer control.I don't think this will be difficult to remedy.  Friend said this is the first system that took control to correct for stall.  This reminds of of EgyptAir 990 where one pilot (suicidal) dove down while the other fought to take it up - eventually the link between yokes broke.",

Good analysis and there are even more questions that will never be answered. BA will work with all parties to improve safety. Basically BA was shot first and then witnesses questioned. Final report could be a year or more. BA is now substantially undervalued.,
"Thanks for a comprehensive analysis.  It would be worthwhile to compare this MCAS system with the stick-pusher systems which have been used on airliners for a long time....it is my understanding that (a) a stick pusher will activate only when *two* angle of attack sensors show an incipient stall, and (b) the activation of the stick pusher cannot fail to come to the attention of the pilots, because it is an abrupt physical movement and is also documented.Whereas MCAS apparently activates based on a single AOA sensor...and, as we now know, was undocumented in data provided to pilots...not sure about the maintenance documentation.Do you know if this 737 model has a stick pusher in addition to the two trim systems?",
"Maintenance changed a faulty sensor and things got worse?   I'm inclined to put this one on the ground crew.    No one would ever design a control sysytem to operate with a improperly installed sensor. A failed sensor?  Yes, obviously.  A functioning sensor installed incorrectly?  Probably not. Great article thank you for making us all a bit smarter.",
Boeing has a good track record compared to SPY over the long term.The average annual return of BA from 11/2/62 to 3/27/18 with dividend reinvestment was 11.07% versus SPY with dividend reinvestment which was 9.939%.The average annual return of BA from 8/1/95 to 11/23/18 with dividend reinvestment was 12.26% versus SPY which was 8.67%.I like Boeing.

"Excellent article!  The subject is not easily written of and most media has concentrated on useless sound bites.  Fortunately, I had been gradually dumping BA shares before the crash as they were going nowhere; the dividend became increasingly weak due to share price increase; and money tied up by the individual increasingly looked to be better invested elsewhere.  On top of that since the crash was the expose' by LMT CEO that BA ""bought"" multiple orders they were competing on at giveaway prices (such as the jet trainer order) to get themselves back in the defense category, which will lead to many billions of $$ in write offs just like the Air Force tanker contract has proven to be.  I see the discussion on whether to reinvest (I am long LMT still) in BA boils down to a professional report generated by BA on this crash; the plan for at least a competitive dividend comparable to LMT's announced after the report; an announcement by BA of why they did not share the data on the new system with pilots (this would appear to be almost a criminal issue here but experienced industry pilots would have to comment on their feelings (why have no media contacted Sully S?).  The whole BA issue of heavy production backlogs on 737's and media stories of having to install engines to fly new aircraft to parking locations and then pulling engines out and bringing them back to power other 737's out of the way reflects the production chaos that likely was distracting BA leadership conflicting over issues like how to advise unfamiliar pilots on new control systems someone at BA seems to have felt they would not be smart or experienced enough to comprehend.....",

@Jeremy McKinzie Thank you for drawing attention to the obvious gap between AMC's trading price and true value. I am curious as to why you assigned a 7.5x EBITDA multiple here?,
"AMC would make an interesting acquisition for Amazon, adding (1) theaters to showcase Amazon Originals on the big screen: (2) data and cross-selling opportunities; (3) convenient physical locations to place Amazon Lockers; (4) ability to fill empty seats last minute through flexible pricing; (5) joint marketing of A-list through Amazon Prime. At its recent market cap of $1.5 Billion, AMC would be a modest acquisition (Wholefoods was $13.7 Billion) and AMC stock price has come off significantly from its recent highs.  Major shareholder Wanda recently sold some AMC shares and could probably be persuaded to sell more at the right price.  Given where Amazon can raise money in the bond market, AMC's dividend of 5.7% would be more than enough to pay for the deal with profit to spare.  Amazon could also increase AMC profit by refinancing its high interest debt at lower interest.

Many are and I suppose have always seemed to be looking at the days when Marijuana will be legal for recreational use and have decided that MO will be the main source.  Maybe they are right but many things must change first.  Federal law which makes use and possession a crime and then the multitude of small business entrepreneurs who have their own little business.  Will they continue to compete against MO? Will MO buy them out?  We are talking about maybe 100's of the businesses or will each state set up their own dispensaries  such as state run and force the mom and pop stores out of business.While I believe that many of the things I discussed will eventually be ironed out, but will take time.  Some of the issues and hurdles are discussed at the following link, and while it is Canada that is discussed many of the same issues will arise.  Since all states have the ability to set their own rules and to outright ban their use regardless of what the Feds do.  Even to day some towns and even some counties ban the sale of alcohol.see link:en.wikipedia.org/...Link for the discussion on MJ laws in Canada.www.theguardian.com/...Allday",
"Based upon the narrative, you would think this this company is withering away. MO is in the top 10 of S&P500 companies in reported annual profit (AAPL is #1). After all this product sales decline they not only have made more money per share, but over time have made more money as a company. The company management is very smart. They will pivot to make money perhaps by acquisition or other means. But what if the company can't move the revenue needle? Companies that have no growth are typically valued at a P/E of 10. If MO traded at a P/E of 10 right now that would be a price of $40. This would be a yield of 8%.This is what would happen:1) MO would buy back shares at this yield and create EPS growth.2) Investors would bid up the 8% yield to probably in the 6% range, since it would be a quality bond substitute. So you see it is unlikely that we would ever see a long term value at a P/E of 10 because of the market reaction and company actions. This assumes that revenues can at least be stable or decline a few percentage points per year. I would argue that the end state valuation is right where it is valued now. The company has already stated that the next two years the earnings growth will be above trend due to the tax reform act. I interpret this to mean not ""7-9%"" but 10%. So if the market keeps the valuation at 13X over next 2 years, you will likely earn a 35% return in 2 years ((10% earnings growth + 6% yield) ^ 2). I can't come up with another investment case that is this easy and is as likely to happen with lower risk.",
"Interesting, and thanks for the work. One tiny correction - I think the 2030 projection should be billions, not millions. A couple points that I think really help to solidify the investment thesis - When looking at cigarette volumes, you also need to consider market share and population dynamics (growth and changes in smoking rates). For the US market, this is pretty easily available. In addition, MO are even publishing their own estimates of the cigarette market when they provide their own market share figures. That also helps to put their volume numbers into context.",

"Should I be concerned about Altria's cigarette volume declines?No.The average annual return of Altria with dividend reinvestment since 1/2/70 has been about 19%1970 was the year that I began to invest in Altria, which was then called Philip Morris.I continued to buy shares over the years whenever they appeared to be cheap.There were three spinoffs over the years.  Never sold any shares of those, either.Now Altria, Philip Morris, Kraft-Heinz and Mondelez are about 20% of the value of my portfolio of 43 stocks.So I am not concerned about Altria's cigarette volume declines.There has been a war on Big Tobacco ever since the surgeon general declared that cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health back in 1964.  They have done everyhing possible to harass Big Tobacco since 1964.

"@Daniel Thurecht  Great article.  Thanks for taking the time to go through the volumes numbers.  I'm sure it was a lot of work, but it provides great insight into MO's operations.  As you so nicely stated in your article, this is the crux of the investment question for MO:""Based on the forecast provided by this model, it appears during 2030 Altria should still be selling approximately 71.9 million cigarettes annually. This represents an average yearly decline of 3.7% from my estimated 2018 volumes. Whether this will be adequate to support their current earnings remains unknowable, however, I believe this will be the case given their track history and the inelastic nature of their products.""At what point might higher prices have a greater than trend line impact on the financials?  In the same way that increasing volumes during the 90's eventually gave way to the steady volume declines we have seen since, will there come a time when the same will happen to profits?  Cigarette demand is relatively inelastic, but will volume and pricing reach an inflection point where profits begin their own slow yet steady decline?Thanks again for the research and very fine article.DS",
"I think you have it completely wrong. The last major regulatory action on Tobacco was in 1998 (for the master settlement.) They have been left alone since except for minor regulatory actions. The exponential decay graph sales are exhibiting are the loss in smokers over the last 20 years.Depending on what Gottlieb has in mind Tobacco could face major regulatory action or not and may suffer a larger loss in the number of smokers or could continue decaying at the same rate.Also, you say cigarette demand is inelastic but that is probably true only within a small range. At some price, the demand may not be as inelastic resulting in a larger loss of smokers (or some future may never start on cigarette instead choosing pot.)  Your analysis still seems incomplete.",

DE is assuming, I guess, that this new market sector that they are carving for themselves will be meekly accepted by the farming consumer.  It will not!

"I spent a few weeks in Iowa in October tending a woodlot where I used to hunt whitetail deer. The farming community of a generation ago is being replaced by agribusiness. The farming operations are huge, with acreages in the thousands. The farms require equipment and service reliability as weather places time pressure on operations. I see Deere more and more dominating the farm equipment business in Iowa. The two decade roll out of Deere in the Brazilian and Argentine soybean belt is huge. I have family members who worked for Deere in South America and Iowa. The company is growing organically in the South American green field farming areas, extending the US template of service and knowledge of the local farm owners and operators. The relationships are generational. Deere is not as cyclical as it used to be in the age of small farms and mainly an American market. The purchase of Wirtgen extends Deere in the Russian and Kazakhstan grain belt. I think the German presence in Russia will be a big growth area for Deere as personal business relationships are exploited by Deere cross selling Ag equipment through Wirtgen's personal relationships in Russia. Deere is becoming the dominant agriculture equipment and service company worldwide. I own shares and think the company will grow slow and steady for decades. It is a holding I expect to thrive through what might be a difficult investing environment of the next decade. DE is a long term hold for me and I will buy more in the next bear market.

"I haven't read a bullish article on AT&T that includes a money back guarantee from the author to cover all long losses in T going forward. Faith in T's future is a mile wide, but only an inch deep right now, just like the blind Wall Street faith in America's strong economy of 2018. After another revenue and earnings miss quarter or two from T, millions of investors will start to bail at the same time. T will likely cut its dividend in half and be sub-$20 a share in the next recession, perhaps as early as the first half of 2019. I can easily argue price competition from the completed Sprint/T-Mobile merger will torpedo profits and cash flows starting in February-March 2019, and that $300 billion in debt and IOUs, net of short-term assets, will become a real and present danger to T bond and stockholders quickly.

"@Okapi Research Thanks for the cogent and well written article.  Although I don't necessarily agree with all aspects of the article, I certainly do agree with your bottom line that T is not going to become another GE.  As one of the CFOs I worked with for a number of years told me, ""Rasher, cash is king, follow the cash.""  T's cash generating capabilities make its debt load manageable, and, indeed, as you and others, who have have written about T's debt load, have carefully explained, the Time Warner acquisition is actually cash flow accretive, even taking into account the additional debt taken on to complete the deal.  I also agree with your point that T is much less cyclical sensitive than GE.Finally, let me say, as one who owned GE since the 90s and only sold earlier this year in the low $20s, that although many have considered Jack Welch a genius, I believe he was an utter disaster.  Yes, he was a genius, but in my opinion he was a genius at building an empire, creating a cut throat culture, and using a complex corporate structure to dupe investors.  Now, Jeff Immelt was no great CEO himself, but he was dealt a terrible hand that I am not sure anyone could have played well other than to simply start from the beginning to break things up.  He tried some in the end, but it was too little, too late.  Steve",

5G will be ‘YUGE’ and should help make ATT great again. Until then debt is high but there’s lots of cash coming in.,

It assumes the market will react  to GE getting into real trouble , something the bond market appears to consider a real possibility , with a cool calm head . Markets are driven to a degree by fear and greed , we have had the later till recently , a GE disaster would surely lead to us seeing fear in action. It would seem not unreasonable to guess ATT and other high debt companies would see a serious sell off . Of course that may lead to a great buying opportunity. Current shareholders may however not enjoy the ""opportunity"" to average in whilst praying its not a knife they are catching.",
"Even though I like ATT, I don't like your argument. You can't apply what happened to ATT in 2008 to now if we were to have another great recession.  In 2008 there was a huge change with how people were using their phone. Smart phones (specifically iPhone ) was coming to the market and att was able to leverage that to raise prices. It was one of those revolutionary product that was a must have for most people. Most people didn’t have smart phone and willing   to spend to have one. I’m highly doubtful that att will only see minimal revenue decline if recession were to hit again. In fact, I can make the argument that ATT will be in danger with the direct tv  customer loss accelerating as people continue to cut cable cord.  They will not be able to raise prices and will face significant direct tv customer loss.The only bright side I see with ATT is that they are able to deliver 5G, they can cause another cord cutting but this time with home internet and they can bundle mobile internet (5G) along with data plan.

"AT&T's profits come almost entirely from its cellular services, which are sold at an average revenue per account (ARPA) of almost twice that of several other developed countries. When and if nationwide competition brings AT&T's ARPA down to the $30 (per month) region AT&T's  future will be in severe jeopardy.  (Simple arithmetic and AT&T's 10K information will verify this, if you are in doubt).  In addition to the systemic competitive risk there is the additional strong possibility that the availability of 5G in major metropolitan areas over the next two years will bring in new local entrants with dirt-cheap high-capacity service capability.  This local cancer on the cellular carriers' pricing will slowly become metastatic.As an investor I am less concerned about the obvious risk to AT&T's dividend than I am to the hit which the IG bond market will be taking.  GE has already taken a 5% whack, and the downgrading of T and VZ will be an even bigger blow.

What I am still not clear on is the aging of the debt. What % is fixed and when does it have to be re-financed? What % is floating and what are the terms?

"While I never seriously considered to invest in GE, I got long T after studying Judge Leon's verdict. People think of AOL, but the acquisition of Time Warner makes entirely sense to me. Come 5G, T will have much more to offer.

"All that is said is logical.  But, so much of the stock is held purely for the 6.5% dividend, any hint at cutting the dividend will be devastating to T’s stock price.  The recent management decision to maintain the current dividend at $0.50 quarterly and stating that they do not anticipate any increase in the near future, may prove to be the prothetic “hint”.  The decision to only maintain the dividend only increases the anxiety of shareholders in it purely for income.  Maybe that anxiety is the main reason why the share price has continued to sink, and will probably continue to do so.",

Society is hungry for data and content and T is going to fill that appetite from every angle. 5G is going to be a game changer for all carriers but I think T will benefit the most since they will be known more as a wireless multimedia company than just a wireless carrier. I believe there was good reason T wasn't as focused on speed and infrastructure for land lines as most ISPs since they had a lot of foresight into the capabilities of 5G which might quickly antiquate even the finest of fiber optic lines. Time will tell. 5G is going to be around 100 mbps which is comparable to most cable and fiber connections that people have running to their homes right now, what happens when there's no longer a need for the land lines and data caps are completely removed from wireless?

"You talk about the ATT business and how revenue could drop if certain things happen.  The ATT of the last 10 years is not going to be the ATT of the next 10 years.Three new business opportunities are being built by ATT and they will be completed over the next 5 years:(1)FirstNet, a first responder network with 2300 government agencies being hooked into ATT.  The federal government kicked off this business by giving ATT a contract for $6 billion cash and then threw in at no cost the spectrum to service this business.  That spectrum is probably worth another $6 billion and the governments that hook into that network will only use 1-10% of the spectrum at any one time.  ATT is putting equipment on 45,000-50,000 cell towers during the next five years and will build 2,000 more cell towers in rural areas to provide FirstNet.  But what is really interesting is that ATT while installing equipment on these towers for FirstNet is that they are putting up the equipment for 5G cell phone operations which is 10 times faster than the current 4G service.  FirstNet will provide more revenue to ATT and the spectrum will be offered for business uses which will provide more revenue2)  5G vs. 4G cell phone capabilities.  Transferring data and receiving data when this system is national in five years will create enormous movement of data that businesses and consumers will pay more for.  Many applications will be operational at those speeds that are not possible today.  More apps will be sold, more cell phone usage, more data consumed by both individuals and by businesses will mean more revenue from this business segment.3)  ATT through phones, DTV, and HBO has 150 million customers in South America, North America, the U.S. and other countries that offer HBO.  Using these instruments and the new film libraries of Warner Bros. motion pictures, HBO movies and series, TNT, etc. ATT will be able to sell directed advertising on all of these offerings.  Directed advertising brings in 2-3 times higher fees than general advertising in a newspaper, magazine, billboard, network television series.These will be three new sources of revenue.  These businesses have nothing to do will adding a fee increase of $1.00 per month on HBO every couple of years or to a cell phone bill or a DTV bill.  These three businesses: one, where the U.S. government has contributed cash and spectrum worth about $12 billion should bring in a billion dollars of revenue to the bottom line in five years.  A nice return on investment.  5G at ten times the speed of 4G currently in use will see business and individuals increase data needs.  That business could be billions to the bottom line.  Advertisers spend $150 billion in the U.S. every year.  I see no reason that ATT with all of its air time to consumers especially with the Warner Bros. film library, HBO and other entertainment entities would not be able to take 5% or more of the advertising budget in the U.S. within 5 years.  T is acquiring the companies that create the foundation to tunnel into digital and television/cable advertising.None of these businesses are reflected in the T revenue mix of the last 10 years.  These businesses are about the next 10 years.",

"CDK has been bleeding valuable engineering talent over the past year, particularly since the summer.  Many leave for genuinely greener pastures in this competitive job market. They should consider valuing their employees more if they want to compete against the Dealer Track and Auto Mates of the world, otherwise their lunch is about to be eaten. It is a good thing new CEO BK likes to write code, he might have to be in the CDK trenches writing it.",
"The elephant in the room is what the new CEO is going to do with existing executives. In the past 9 months CDK has seen a mass exodus of its most experienced engineers and lower level leaders. Fortellis, as an idea makes a lot of sense. But it's implementation is far from ideal for the industry, integrators and especially dealers. CDK has done everything in it's power to maintain a sudo monopoly in the auto industry. This hasn't been done by developing high quality products, it's been done by buying up competition, and by preventing integration into it's product by outside ""Hostile integrators"".  Fortellis was never intended to be a real product, instead, it was a smoke screen to show innovation while the company tried to sell - many demos were faked. Once a sale seemed improbable, the executive leadership scrambled to get the vaporware to be a real thing. In the process, most of the Fortellis team, who'd been unhappy with the inaccurate press releases and public statements quit. Until the existing CTO is replaced, a true, technology play from CDK just isn't possible. So in short: It is a potential turn around with the right leadership at the helm, but the change of CEO's won't do much good if the same, spin incentivized executives are below him making the architectural & product decisions.",
"CDK has a huge image problem with dealers. By charging dealers a ""Connection Fee"" for their vendors to access the dealers data this costs the dealer thousands per month on top of the monthly CDK bill that is often times wrong and always seems to be in CDK's favor! Any outside vendor like a CRM or DMV service or a F&I menu provider gets hit. By switching DMS  away from CDK you save instantly on these fees. A mass exodus of dealers is happening to lower cost DMS providers that don't have to depend on connection fees to show Wall St. how awesome they are. Dealer TrackAuto SoftDealer builtAuto Mate ...and there will be more at this years NADA show in SF. All picking off CDK customers. Granted that the big publics like Sonic and Autonation have special deals with CDK and likely don't pay the fees like private stores do, most privately held stores all know the deal. CDK thinks they are ""sticky"" ( I love that! ) because the old business offices are run by people not paying the bills out of their pocket and hate change at any cost. The problem is these people are retiring and being replaced by people that - let's say can adapt to technology easier. Of course I am short CDK, hoping to recoup some past connection fees. I stopped paying them when I switched DMS to Dealer Track this year. In a few years I will have saved enough to buy a bigger airplane, even if my puts don't pay out.",CDK Global: A Potential Turnaround Play

"How is Dell a ""highly leveraged hardware company?"" Dell earns, pro forma on 755M shares, ~$6 to $7 per share, ~40% of which is contributed by VMWare, and another 30% from EMC, both enterprise data virtualization companies. The remaining earning power comes from an oligopolistic PC business which will grow at slightly faster than GDP and which still has pricing power because of the much-misunderstood need for PCs for productivity.  So you have an entity that derives effectively 70% of its earning power from........Software!

@David Zanoni Just discovered this company. Past performance and valuation is really attractive. What do you think of the last CC and guidance ?,
"I like it too, but I'm not so sure this is a good time to buy. This is going to be a volatile stock. I'd rather wait for a better price to mitigate some of the risk. I'm fairly risk adverse. I invest mostly in dividend paying large cap stocks and I've been able to find more than a handful of good values in that arena over the past few years that have produced more than a 12% return. At the current price for PRLB, is 12% upside good enough for a smaller cap non-dividend paying stock? Or, perhaps thats a conservative estimate?",
"@David Zanoni ""I see Proto Labs as the best value in this space, since the company has the lowest valuation and also the highest expected revenue growth (consensus). These factors will help drive the stock to outperform its competitors in 2019, in my opinion.""I have the same view on this company. On the last quarterly report call, the PRLB managers made a prudent understatement. They want to increase the earnings steadily by 9% a year. Well, this can bring us many positive earning surprises in 2019 and 2020 if it rises by 11% (your published number).Anyway, I will buy on dips and I expect 150$ in 2020.",

Have been advised by CPA that if you do buy RDS.A then one can file at tax time to get credit for the taxes that were withheld so really no loss at all.  With RDS.A at lower price than RDS.B then you would realize a higher yield upon filing for the tax credit.,
"To be clear, yield is not my only consideration; I do look at other differences between the companies and their futures too.",
"Now that BP and RDS.A/B are returning roughly the same yield I’m somewhat conflicted which one should choose.  It is said that RDS.A is the choice for UK and NL residents and the B shares for US investors because of difference in tax treatment, though it is said that upcoming changes in the Dutch tax law would nullify the difference.  But, there are those who suggest the tax change may not be forthcoming, or has been already been scrapped.  Because of the lack of clarity I’m leaning towards BP but would like to hear if others struggle with the same question or better yet, what their choice ended up to be.  TIA!",

"Why no love for Relistor?  Relistor is Salix's second best selling drug and is doing fantastic as well.... I think a sale of SLXP is probably a good idea as long as the sale does NOT effect the EBITDA.  So Bausch would have to sell Salix for equal or more than what they paid for it... With the moves Bausch has made with Salix by adding more reps to get sales of Xifaxin and Relistor really moving, I think of sale of the Salix division is probably the strategy.  The sale of Salix would  allow Bausch to really take a huge chunk out the Bausch's debt load and I think any risk of default would be taking off the table at the point...

"GE exiting from Baker Hughes is a good thing for Baker Hughes and possibly the best thing.GE's business practices nearly destroyed all the oil & gas businesses they acquired. That is because:- GE introduced multiple layers of unproductive management that sucked resources & slowed business decisions- GE believed they could simply dominate the industry like they had with wind turbines and bully oil companies into buying their products.- GE tried to convert custom job-shops into standardized mass-producers. They tried to run equipment suppliers that sell a few dozen highly-customized parts each year like a light bulb manufacturer.- The GE managers never caught on to the O&G trend of cutting costs, reducing inventory, streamlining, & being more efficient when the oil downturn hit. They kept pushing 'big data' and other high-tech spending initiatives.- And many more.As GE exits & their influence wanes, BH has significant growth potential, but the gamble is whether they can seize it. BH has cut a lot and is highly focused on continued streamlining. However, they have yet to realize the need to eliminate entire swaths of management which leaves them top-heavy without sufficient workers on the front lines getting the job done. They are implementing measures such as part number restrictions and product life software that could slow them down so much the company could die of starvation. Thus, while BH could grow significantly, it's also a very risky situation. I own some BH stock, and I intend to sell it, but I won't do so quite yet. I believe their stock price has devalued as part of the overall stock market correction, and as the overall market recuperates, I expect BH's stock will as well. During that time, I don't have confidence in finding other stocks with more short-term rebound potential.",

All you have to do is project out these revenues 4-5 years, or further, when this income could be realized and discount the underlying net income (based on historic net margin percentages) back to the PV to determine how much those DUCS are worth in today's dollars. From there, you can multiply the NPV EPS by a reasonable multiple to arrive at a price per share target. This model wouldn't include any easement income or land sales, so i think there would be a decent margin of safety in the assumptions.

"A land grant section goes back to the way the transcontinental railroads were financed.  This was about the time of the Civil War; the government had lots of land and little cash.  As the track was laid across the prairies, railroad would receive a section of land on the right hand side of the track; the next mile down the track would earn the railroad the section on the left hand side of the track.  The third mile would get the section on the right hand side of the track.  This alternating sides of the track is what gives the ""checkerboard"" appearance to the lands.  It was envisioned that the railroads would sell the land and use the funds to pay for more track.  Although the transcontinental routes were built, many of the people involved were far short of being good candidates for the angel choir.  The routes which were chosen reflected, in part, what were thought to be the best lands.   Immigrants were recruited to come from Europe to the West.  They left the East Coast by train and were taken to lands owned by the railroads.  Of course, the railroads being noble, upright companies sold the immigrants the property at a very good price--not.  The history of the railroads and the settlement of the West is fascinating.     Almost all of the railroads went bankrupt.  Most the railroads we have today are amalgamations of a number of small railroads.  The Norfolk Southern is made up of about 28 railroads, many of which were themselves amalgamations of other railroads.  The Texas and Pacific was one of these railroads.  When it failed, their lands were put into a liquidating trust.  As the land was sold, the proceeds were to pay the creditors.  The Trust is still liquidating the assets and will probably continue to do so for another 100 years.Just a thought or two.",
"TPL is intriguing, and the more I learn, the more interested I am.  I've got a few questions.  I'm surprised I haven't seen them discussed.  Apologies in advance if I have missed them:Their property ownership should be public record.  But I have not seen estimates of the current market value.  (Yes, it is a lot of acreage, but mostly in big chunks or contiguous areas).  But still, there should be at least an estimated range of the value.Obviously the mineral rights are valuable.

"Shareholders Unite, Thank you for writing this article.  If TPL were tohit $520 it would be trading around 20X 2018's EPS which should bearound $26 a share.  For those shareholders who want managementto buy back stock more aggressively, call up Mr. Packer at TPL and tell him.  The trust does take into account shareholders comments onsuch matters.  My guess as to where the stock price will go dependson energy prices over the long-run.  Thanks also to all of the intelligent comments here.  Keep them coming!",
"@Shareholders Unite You said: ""It's not a surprise why the shares of Texas Pacific Land crashed quite spectacularly; this is entirely oil driven.""When looking at oil and oil ETFs, TPL has reflected in no way the price decline of oil since the low in TPL from March 2009.  Instead, TPL has more reflected the reaction in the stock market or real estate.Worth noting is the fact that TPL has increased more than +1,130% while USO has decreased -73% since March 2009.  Likewise, funds like DBO, DBE, BNO have declined -47%, -25%, -18%, respectively.  There is nothing in the data that suggests TPL and any oil price index or oil ETF resemble each other in any way, at least since the 2009 lows.Alternatively, the decline in TPL could be better attributed to the decline in FANG stocks if correlation is the basis for determining the reason for the recent decline.I have recently posted my thoughts on what TPL is most reflective of at the following link: seekingalpha.com/...I have confidence that the attribution of TPL to oil, whether WTI or any other similar commodity price, is far off the mark and the data since 2009 supports this claim.",
"@Visual Capital :Pay dividends, Invest in the water business, accumulate a cash horde to save for a rainy day.  Given their increased revenues and expenses and the lumpiness of the oil business, I think their cash position is appropriate.  It is possible that some companies would go bankrupt in a recession and be unable to pay what they owed to TPL.  Some of TPL's land was acquired by foreclosure in the last recession.

"Five years ago from today oil prices were over $90 a barrel- today they are about $50 a barrel. Despite that, TPL's profits are up 7 fold over the past five years and the stock is up about six fold. Clearly the stock is not dependent on high oil prices to thrive. I believe fracking allows oil companies operate with a lower breakeven so they can continue to pump oil out of TPL's land despite lower oil prices- TPL will continue to rake in the dough from royalties with zero overhead.",
"It is clear from some of the comments that many people regard this as a long term investment, which I think is understandable bearing in mind how long the company's assets are expected to last. However, such investors should also take an equally long view on the future of oil and whether the expected introduction of electric vehicles and ever more effective methods of extracting oil will have a long term depressing effect on demand for oil and the volume produced. I know that oil is used for plenty of things other than vehicles but I think it would be fair to say that long term oil demand and therefore TPL is particularly susceptible to technologies improving faster than currently expected or even the development of new disruptive technologies, although I think we must be safe at least until 2025 and probably until 2030.",
"If buying back shares is the main obligation of the trustees you might expect them to take it seriously with at least an attempt at timing. From the above reference to 10% of shares bought back over the last five years at what looks like a steady basis, it would appear that the two fifths bought back over the last two years have taken most of the cash. Last year some analysts on this site suggested that TPL was overvalued and it has since doubled, but the trustees just keep buying.      Perhaps now is a good time to buy as the author suggests. I should be cautious in claiming that TPL's fall is entirely based on the oil price. It may be so, but it is interesting to compare previous rises of TPL against oil. The correlation is there but not entirely. In 2007-8 TPL fell 64%. It began falling a full year before oil, and what was oil doing, rising like a rocket? But then oil fell 71%, until three months after TPL began to recover. In 2014-15 TPL fell 42%, this time after oil had begun its 68% fall but bottoming early 2015, a year before oil did (admittedly TPL went nowhere in that year). Now TPL is down 37% and oil 34% and yes, they coincide so far.     An interesting article, however I shall wait to take a position at least until the downtrend line is broken convincingly around 580-590..",

I don't see the point of buying a royalty producing trust when there is no dividend to pass those royalties on to the stock holders.  Buying back stock at high prices is not a good strategy.

"Thank you for the thorough analysis, I really enjoyed the article. I agree with your conclusions and recently opened a small position. I’d like to bring it up to equal weight (if not overweight) should shares continue to struggle over the near to intermediate future. From what I can gather the Permian seems to be the real deal—I say this primarily bc o&g majors seem to favor spending capex in this region, despite total o&g capex still being much lower than it was prior to the crash in 2015. So they are voting with their money on the Permian, and not only in acreage but also in technologies that are relevant to the Permian, such as water recycling. Tpls water business seems promising as well, I think this is a rare instance of it being good that tpl is actually spending on capex. The planned pipelines are another nice tailwind that really isn’t that far out from contributing to results, assuming they are completed. Long term I am also intrigued by the potential to store and capture co2 in old oil fields and the saline aquifers that it appears are beneath tpls land, though I need to do more research into the aquifers beneath their land. Of course there are risks to tpl, but overall I like it as an investment...good luck to all!",
"A key concern should be the continuing strength of demand for TPL-royalty-oil.TPL's perpetual-royalty acreage was carved-out when TPL sold the mineral rights under all of their surface-acreage to Texaco in 1962.  Texaco was acquired by Chevron in 2002.Chevron, in recent annual reports, indicated that they intend to increase their Permian production by 33% annually, for many years to come, to source more of their crude oil needs domestically and onshore.  Much of this production is coming from the 100% annual production increases from TPL royalty-acres.  Probably because TPL royalties run about 5% of production-value, while the golng royalty-rate elsewhere is about five times higher.Further, Chevron's clout should enable them to gather and ship a higher proportion of their TPL production than most other Permian producers can.  Chevron news releases do not complain about pipeline capacity constraints.I believe TPL is uniquely advantaged to enjoying higher-than-competitors ' gains in oil production for many years into the future.TPL's water business is a logical addition to the Trust's charter to generate revenue from land-holdings.  I dream that TPL would exploit its huge borrowing power to acquire Hi Crush (HCLP) and get into the fracking-sand business and also brimg in a very competent operating management group.",
"I suspect that the story of oil and natural gas is the story of the hare and tortoise.  So many oil companies start out real quick, often using a lot of borrowed money.  They make big profits as the price of oil goes up; however, if the price stagnates or declines, they are often out of business and/or bankrupt.  TPL seems to be more of a tortoise.  It seems to run on a vision which extends over 100 or more years.  If I had the money, which I did not, and the knowledge, which I did not, and the patience, which I did not, TLP would have been a great stock to buy 100 or so shares of when I was in my 20s and just put away for retirement.  If I would have done that, my retirement would be much better than it is now.The question is whether a 20-something should do that today.Just a thought or two.P.S. @Shareholders Unite --  great article.",

However, there is also a high risk for the opposite, namely because IFRX has so far used a chimeric monoclonal antibody (IFX-1), which is not well suited to treat chronic disease such as HS, because sooner or later patients will generate antibodies to IFX-1 and the drug will loose clinical efficacy. Apparently InflaRx is aware of this problem, and this is why they are developing a ""more humanized"" antibody, i.e. IFX-2. Another problem is that IFRX, even in the now ongoing placebo-controlled phase II study is administering the IFX-1 antibody by intravenous infusions, which are not the way to go in chronic disease, where a subcutaneous drug formulation is way more patient friendly.

@FCFGUY . I think I arrive at the same conclusion; the margin of safety is very large. They (BBBY) should retire their debt or part of it.,
"@Oyat , So, where do you think BBBY's operating margin (EBIT) ends up? Back to ~ 8%? Gross margin was ~40% in 2012 and has come down to ~ 36% now. Suppose those 400bps are gone. Back in 2012, BBBY's EBIT margin was ~15%. So that gets us down to 11% just considering the effect from gross margin compression. If 70% of the additional SG&A expense gets recouped and current margins are ~3% (latest quarter) then, 70% x (11%-3%) = 5.6%. Add 5.6% to ~ 3% and we end up at 8-9% for EBIT margins. If that's true, then BBBY is very cheap at current prices.",
"THX.  Very nice analysis.  BBBY is a perfect example of your thesis.  At $13/s, the market is imputing an operating margin of roughly 2%, going forward.  As you note, they will never get back to where they were (low double digits), but their SGA has risen from ~25% in FY 2014to a current rate of ~31-32%.  They were late to recognize the problem, but are moving to catch up, quickly.  The 2019/20 selling year should be their nadir, and the margins, especially SGA should begin to decline, thereafter.  At a 3% operating margin, the stock should be worth middle to high teens and at 4%, low twenties.  While you wait, the 64c divided yields 5%, and even at $1.50/s in FY2020/21, is well covered.Of some concern is the bonds, as noted above.

"This may be slow to catch on. Or, it might spread like wildfire as the number of folks who have either known someone or experienced the benefits themselves could at any time just start growing exponentially.Four years ago, I weighed around 260. During a consult with the doctor following my annual fasting labs at the VA, the doc wanted to prescribe metformin to try to reign in my high blood sugar. He wanted to prescribe atorvastatin to curb my climbing cholesterol levels. He began to tell me about what he wanted to have me take to keep my blood pressure under control, but at that point I interrupted him. I asked if I could come back in a few months instead of waiting another whole year and have another set of fasting labs done. I said everyone I ever knew that started depending on that many medications for so many different things was always on them for the rest of their life. Taking metformin to control your blood sugar is just the first step down a road. Once you head down that road, it isn't that long before you're jabbing yourself with a needle multiple times per day to inject yourself with insulin. I've watched it happen to too many people.You can go down that road, because it's too ""hard"" to learn how to change your life...or you can make that change, ditch the pills and the lifelong dependence on them, make yourself pretty much stroke and heart attack proof, and probably tack another two decades of healthy living unfettered by the chronic health problems most older Americans have who eat the SAD (Standard American Diet). Today at a few months short of 62, my weight now hovers around 160...a hundred pounds less. I've kept the weight off for years now.I don't need medication for my blood sugar. I don't need medication for my cholesterol.I don't need medication for my blood pressure. In fact, my blood pressure is better now than it ever was even when I was younger and ran 6 miles a day. (It's true: no amount of exercise can make up for a bad diet).The chest pains I was having 24/7 that radiated out my shoulder and down my arm making it feel like my arm was being squeezed off are far in the past now, and NOTHING makes them come back. My resting heart rate often drops below 50. Tyson is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I have a lot of confidence in the fact most people won't wise up and stop eating dead animals or dairy products. They won't give up their fried foods, their cheese, their butter, their pastries, cakes, donuts, etc. That's good. Thank you for the dividends.But a few will read ""The China Study"" or ""The Whole Foods Diet"" and discover the key to lifelong health, saving a fortune on healthcare in the long run while you're at it. I fully intend, and believe I will, collect my social security for at least 50 years.I believe the first HALF of my life is over.",

My family always buys physical media for any Switch games that cost more than $20.

Good article..,
The leadership at ACB seems superior in my estimation. They have quickly moved into hemp by absorbing Europe's largest hemp supplier. They also have a decent foothold in medical cannabis and worldwide exposure. They seem to make all the right moves and are more transparent about their numbers. They are not afraid of exposing bad news along with good. These days that means something. Honesty has become hard to find.,
long Aurora since $1.20....it will be in the top 2  MJ companies for the foreseeable future.,
i think one important point that got missed here is also the fact that ACB is younger than CGC and has caught up to it despite the fact. Which is actually a very hard task to accomplish. Had they been working on the same time frame I'm sure they would have surpassed by now.,

They replaced Tyson executives and CEO with Hillshire staff.  They spun off non-protein brands.  Then they overpaid for Advance Pierre with the idea of expanding convenience foods (sandwiches) but Advance Pierre really fits into food service and does not share Hillshires margins or shelf life.

"How can BHC(Salix) buy anything?? That is just ludicrous. They are trying to get out of debt, adding debt isn't the answer.... If anything BHC should sell Salix for more than what they paid for it.  That way the EBITDA won't be effected..  Even though the Salix division is BHC's main growth driver, it will also command the highest price in a sale... If BHC can get $15B for the Salix unit, they can use that money to pay down on the $25B they owe... That gets them down to $10B in debt and they still have the Eye Care and Dermatology divisions... They could easily spread that $10B out over time.. $10B in debt is manageable for BHC. Plus the sale of SLXP would probably send BHC shares to well over $40.. BHC could then dilute a bit and pay off another big chunk of the debt.  People forget, that even though BHC is doing a great job of keeping the lights on, they aren't out of the woods yet, in fact they have a very long way to go.  They are still in survival mode but, with a few good moves, like selling SLXP for $15B+, it makes things a lot easier going forward...

At a compound of 8% per year over 4 years (2018-2022) we get $13.92 revenue per paying customer. 250,000,000 x $13.92/month x 12months = $41,760,000,000 yearly Revenue.So after 4 years, the company that was once valued more than Disney, is still pulling in less revenue.

The author protests too much.  So he argues that if Netflix increases fees by 50% they still have a PE 2.5 times the market ( my calc not his).

"First let's look at Netflix the business separately from Netflix the stock. Netflix the business is cheap ($10 per month) and it has lots of content.  But some of that content is crap, some is awesome.  None of it is live.  Some of that licensed content disappears when the licenses expire.  Some of that content will eventually disappear when alternative content owners (Disney) create their own platform.Netflix the stock is not cheap by any metric.  Worse, Netflix the business is not only NOT self funding, it's on a treadmill.  They CAN'T stop tapping the debt market to fund new content.  Ever.  And it's an accelerating treadmill to justify their valuation.  If they cut their content funding, the stock gets hammered.  If they tap the equity market instead of the debt market, the stock gets hammered.  As for the value of their content, I distill a simple principle of capital or commodities - scarcity.  There's a limited amount of good ideas or good content.  Increasing the amount of money you're throwing around to outspend everyone else does not increase the amount of good content, it just means you overpay for the good content and you get a bunch of other crap.  But as I stated above, they can't slow it down and they can't tap the equity market.  Maybe they eventually alter their business model to get their original content in theatres or they integrate with cable providers but I can't currently view their stock as a vehicle for fundamental return on investment.",

"This article reminds me of some papers that I regularly gave B-s to when I used to teach Master's courses in finance in 2000: all the right ideas are in there but the critical connections between the different concepts and their ultimate interaction relative to what an investor would care about is never quite made. 1.Content 2. Competition 3. Pricing Power 4. Valuation-Does NFLX have any competitive advantage on 1, over AMZN or DIS?-Do you think AMZN can't deliver globally any better, or that DIS can't deliver its content through Amazon?-Are there any competitors that are already able to produce content and have a well-oiled machine?Now how the heck do you get pricing power against competitors that can both produce and deliver content? Yes, some people might pay $20 a month for each of DIS, NFLX, AMZN and 2 other services but not a whole lot. Meanwhile all this high yield debt with rising coupons is piling up to build that content machine that other people already have. Its an avalanche of snow coming up against a fireball of lava. Unless you model out which is larger in the right heat-adjusted metric and get it right you won't know whether the debt lava will melt all the snow or the snowball will overwhelm the lava.

"I don't agree that their costs don't go up as they add subscribers. Now, as you may know, Netflix's COGS is the amortization of its content, plus a few other things, but mostly that. As their content grows, so does the amortization. Now, I've only done yearly data, but basically, their content spending per paid subscriber has only gone up.2015: $101.90	2016: $123.48	2017: $132.70This will hold true as they add content from other countries as they expand into different markets. As far as cable goes. They are more expensive because they offer more content. AT&T U-Verse, at the $110/month price point you mentioned, offers 550+ channels. Which include very popular live broadcasting such as news and sporting events. To say Netflix could just raise prices based on this, and not lose any subscribers, isn't true. The markets they are trying to expand in to maintain subscriber growth, such as India, are very price sensitive, and competition for streaming services in the U.S. is growing. Netflix, in my opinion, is extremely overpriced, and will see a huge decline in their stock price in 2019.",
@Aceinmysleeve  Are you buying more on the dip?,
"Most subscriber adds are no longer in the US as US growth is slowing.  The US subs pay much more than international subs.  So growth in revenues continues to slow down.  Funny thing, I was watching a show on NFLX the other day and noticed it was produced by SyFy.  All of those kinds of shows will now be bid on between different streaming companies so any popular content produced from others will now become more expensive as NFLX is no longer the only option for them to find a wider audience.There are lots of headwinds now.  I really can't believe they didn't go out and raise $10-$20 billion at least by selling equity when the shares were trading around $400.  That was fiscal malpractice.",
"You can't analyze a stock based on what it would be worth if they increased the price of their service significantly, without it having any effect whatsoever on subscribers. I assume Netflix knows their business better than you do. If they believed they could increase prices without losing customers or slowing growth, they would have done it by now. It's like valuing Coca Cola based on what they would be worth if cans of Coke sold for $5. It is useless fun with numbers.",
"“earnings power"" later is a valid way to value growth stocks. However, in a rising rate environment, long dated assets (cash flow later) are valued much less than short dated assets (cash flow right now)Everyone wants to bull and bear debate NFLX on an unknowable competitive landscape in an age of disruption. I prefer to take the macro view. The macro view is why bulls had won the argument on this stock the whole time, and they didn't even realize it. You mean  I can borrow for 4-5% to finance years of  depreciating content? Yeah, at that rate, business model works.",
"Your discussion of the competition omits Amazon prime (which offers numerous other benefits including whole foods discounts and can be bankrolled by AWS cash flow), and Hulu which is now majority-owned by Disney... if you have no interest in Netflix original series, as I don't, then you have no interest in paying a higher price for Netflix.  Additionally, T now owns Warner media, and DirecTV, as well as captive mobile and cable (Uverse) subscribers to market to.  Considering the competition more thoroughly when assessing ability to raise prices is important.",
"Meanwhile, the cost for the Roku channel is $0 without original content, Disney + is on its way, Disney/Fox buyout will put HULU squarely under Disney control, and everybody is starting to stream content.  I pay for HULU, NFLX, Amazon Prime, and get ROKU for free.  When I add Disney +, I will most likely drop NFLX.  I do not think I will be the only one.",
"I think Netflix should at least raise the rates to break even, but if they can survive, tripling or quadrupling subscribers first makes sense, too.",
P/E way too high. Too much debt. Has massive gap to fill at $220. Bear Market.  Too many people share Netflix with friends and family.  At most it is a day trading stock.,
"You still have to account for the fact that original content that NFLX has spent hundreds of million dollars ( Adam Sandler , a cadre Of comics that couldn’t fill the Comedy store) is really subpar and future distributions will be really tough . Once all the Disney and Fox content is removed from Netflix’s library, there will be slim pickings . Yes they made some great shows like House of Cards ( reboot of the English show ) , Claire Foy as the young Queen and many other shows that deserve Emmys . But that doesn’t even add up to 10% of the shows and they still have to rely on shows from other networks and Films that can’t find distribution elsewhere can always find a home at Netflix . There are a lot of headwinds and it comes down to quality content which is simply not finding its way to Netflix . Even the Final 8 episodes of House of Cards were rushed and left audiences bereft . NFLX is a $150 Stock masquerading as a $300 stock and with more and more streaming options from Fox and Dis , you have to admit that competition just became fierce . Still, bulk of new money will come from International subs and while that’s great on a balance sheet, most countries pay less than 40% of what US customers pay . I got on NFLX train at $50 pre-split so I have no complaints but new comers will find it harder to get the growth they are vying from this version of Netflix . Hope I am wrong though .",

My guess the weakness in the stock has been mainly attributable to the declining headgrades at a faster rate than feasibility study projections and the firm has been covering this up with higher throughput.

"The only thing that can change the price of a commodity as fast and significantly as we have just experienced in the oil markets is speculation, not fundamentals. Fundamentals, the actual supply and demand, barring a nuclear war, change very slowly. Speculation and the perspective that it is based on can change in an instant and can cause large swings in prices due to leverage and liquidity. In fact, the only rapid changes in prices that we have experienced in oil markets due to fundamentals have largely been due to negative supply shocks and even those were overdone (meaning that markets acted as if those shocks were permanent rather than temporary). That fact that oil prices have fallen as fast as we have just seen most likely is the result of the unwind of a large or popular speculative trade. Don't be surprised if oil prices are back in the 70's in 6 months.",
"Hello Vlad, Thanks for the article. I have a few comments with regard to oil prices and particularly the supply side. First of all, it appears that supply growth has mainly come from the US in recent years  and an increase of 2 Mbpd in the last 12 months. The pace of this growth has been limited by infrastructure and economic viability. In the longer term, it is that economic viability which will win and we are bound to see a levelling off of production. Current high prices seem to be related to the build in US crude inventories. However, I have noticed that the overall US inventory (including refined products) has levelled out over the last few weeks. My guess is that this might mean 2 things. Firstly that the maintenance season puts more storage before the refinery and less after. Second, that more oil was moving around the world when the price was higher. i.e. consumers stocking up as they believed prices would continue to rise and producing countries making hay while the sun shined (e.g. Iran selling off stocks while possible, KSA responding to increased demand).However, the question here has to be whether underlying production has also increased. My guess is that, outside of the US, it probably has not. Iranian production will probably continue to decline both because the sanction waivers will probably expire and because Iran must now be finding it more difficult to access insurance, technology, finance and so forth. KSA and Russia will probably come to an agreement to stabilize the price a bit. How much the rest of OPEC does remains to be seen. The UAE, for instance, are very keen to increase their production over the coming years. On the demand side, there is some fear, mostly due to the US - China tension and of course the fact that increasing prices will temper new demand. Both valid points. So, overall, I think we might actually see things come back into balance and perhaps prices could start to consolidate around current levels.",
"for what it's worth, shortsqueeze.com reports DO's short interest north of 30% of its float vs around 15-20% for its peers (NE, RIG, ESV, RDC). also of interest is days to cover; all the drillers are around 6-7 days while DO is almost 11. appears that the relentless pounding in DO over the past 2 months is attributed to the high level of shorting. dangerous seeing as DO is an extremely low float stock with high concentration of ownership (Loews, FMR, and Blackstone own 86mil of 137mil total shares, approx 63%). this seems to explain why DO goes up by half as much as the other drillers on up days, and falls around 20-40% more on down days. any explanation for this divergence from the rest of the OSD pack? is it simply the market is mad at DO for being conservative? if it were, wouldn't that trend revert to the mean with oil prices back down? why are the more levered players (RIG and ESV) being rewarded for their risky, growth oriented strategies when oils down 32%? none of us really know the answer, just wanted to throw it out there though.",

Let's just start with a couple of quotes from your article where you cite factors influencing the astounding growth of Dexcom's business:""Broadening market penetration to type II and the so-called 'non-intensive' market (that is, people who don't suffer from diabetes).""The comment as the type II meaning 'people who don't suffer from diabetes' shows an amazing lack of basic knowledge about diabetes.

Here's another quote from your article regarding Dexcom's future growth:""Using the G6 as a platform for other products and services. For instance, the company is working on a software application based on its core G6 sensor and algorithms and it is also developing a fully-disposable glucose recording device (called Verily) which it will be using next year in various pilots for type I diabetes. (A solution for type II diabetes will be based on a new platform and is years off as it has to go through clinical studies).""FYI 'Verily' is the name of the healthcare division of Google/Alphabet, Dexcom's partner in the development of a CGM device being developed for use in the management of non intensively managed type 2 DM, which make up the vast majority of diabetic patient. Yesterday Verily and Dexcom jointly announced an extension of their collaboration agreement where Dexcom is paying Verily $250 million in Dexcom stock in return for providing it's technical expertise in co-developing it's product.  This is great news for Dexcom shareholders, because it means Google /Alphabet (parent corp of it's healthcare division Verily) is confident that Dexcom stock will appreciate further (in contrast to your thesis that the stock is 'priced to perfection') otherwise they would not accept royalty for their contribution in the form of DXCM stock. I won't bother with dissecting the rest of your comments, but I will agree on two things.First, Dexcom's future growth for current products is amazing (and FYI my patients are extremely happy with the product they are using) Secondly, the competition seems to be growing as well but is not detracting from relecting the huge size of the unpenetrated diabetes market and the fact that different segments of the market are emerging allowing growth for low cost and higher cost segments whose value is distinguished in terms of accuracy, ease of use, validation in clinical trials,  and reputation and perceived value among health care insurers, health care providers prescribing the instruments, and most importantly patients who use the device.  Talk to some folks using the new G6 CGM from Dexcom or look at some blogs from type 1 DM who have started using it.  The current growth in Dexcom sales will be in my opinion going on for the next 5 years and G6 sales worldwide grow and the Verily/Dexcom collaboration deliviers it's new CGM platform which will open up sales to the non-intensively manged Type 2 DM market comprising the vast majority of the diabetic patients.",DexCom Is Priced For Perfection

"First let me say that this is one of the better articles on Visa that I have read in quite some time. Second let me say I too have been thinking about those ""Rising Expenses"" at Visa.  I have actually thought about that for quite a while now.  I think the thing that Mr. Pete Rose completely forgets is just a few of the basic fundamentals: People love using their Visa card because of the incredible Rewards Programs that they offer. Second, the incredible convenience of having a card in your billfold or purse where you can virtually use it everywhere and pay for something without having to carry a big wad of cash with you.  Checks have died a slow and painful death and actually retailers really don't like taking checks for fear that it may bounce. And with the huge advent of the internet and the Smartphone Visa and Mastercard will continue to prosper.  So even though the companies are not perfect (but who is???) they will continue to grow their earnings.  Think about this when you are ""out and about"" just be very observant the next time you are at the grocery store, gas station, Target, Walmart, or where ever you shop.  Everybody and their brother and their brothers 2nd cousin pays for their ""stuff"" with either a Visa or a Mastercard.  So while some people like to bitch about the small fee they charge they both more than make up for it with their rewards programs and the fantastic convenience that they both provide.  Also think about this.  Everybody would like to get a pay raise, correct???   Well when there's more money available to spend then that translates into more money flowing thru their Visa and Mastercards.  Take 2 large steps back and look at the ""BIG PICTURE""  here folks and it will hit you like a sledgehammer as to WHY they will continue to be successful.

"I dont think the author understands the bear case since not a sliver of it is mentioned. I’ve been more or less the lone V & MA bear on SA for years now, premised that they are grossly over-earning and ripping off u and i. Here is my case, reposted, in one breath:  I myself have commented too many times on various bullish V & MA Articles here about how these two companies have nothing proprietary but their muscle, have the highest ebit margins of any large caps (or even smid caps!) in the entire world save for a few energy & biotech companies, have enjoyed an outrageous 2000 bps each of ebit margin expansion since their IPOs 10+ years ago (its true), and have enjoyed the massive, obscene tailwind from 2010's Durbin Amendment (which they initially feared) as it removed the % cap they can charge on transactions under $10 - and guess where the highest growth in card usage has been - yep, in transactions under $10! Would you pay for a latte with plastic even 5 years ago? No. But today? Hell, nearly everyone does. And the CEO of Visa is so freakin' haughty and high on himself that he actually told investors at a sellside conference last year that he hoped Durbin would be repealed, i guess because he has the balls to believe he can get $.36 in interchange for your $3.50 latte, up from their current .26, which itself is up a massive 400% from the .06 they used to receive pre-2010's Durbin Amendment. You see, the proliferation of using plastic for small $ transactions is the main driver of growth for V & MA the past 8 years, since Durbin. When the Fed passed Durbin and decreed that in exchange for lower interchange rates on high $ transactions (like $2000 big screen tvs - this was 2010 mind u) they threw V & MA a bone by RAISING the minimum % interchange fee on transactions under $10. This has been a MASSIVE windfall to these networks as the Fed failed to forsee the trend in low $ plastic transactions that has since taken hold and completely turned upside down the point of sale experience. So whats wrong with all this? The USA has the highest interchange rates in the world - by a mile - and it cant last. And you newbies are all buying in at current prices while the duo is grossly over-earning off you and I. The only stupider buyer are the 2 companies themselves, buying back a ton of stock daily in the open market at any price! Ya'll get it now??!! No? Well neither do all the institutional longs, so don't feel too bad. To me its akin to Mylan and the epipen pricing fiasco - the fleecing of America. V & MA are fleecing u and i. Durbin needs to be repealed. The NRF (which is basically 4 big box retailers) wont do it because their size has enabled them to cut marginally better interchange deals due to their volumes.

I thought V and MA and the other fintech names were acting well relatively speaking, but now V and MA have taken some hits and SQ and PYPL are really getting hit.My question is do you have a price at which V would be at in 2019 should its multiple be less than 31?I suppose for those of us that want to own and keep buying V should just keep buying periodically on dips or monthly for example.Or I suppose it depends on your time horizon. If we are long term investors we should keep buying on dips.If we are traders we should buy large on dips and perhaps sell on rips.Thoughts?",

"@Steelhead there is nothing cold about this stock.  it just reported it 6th consecutive quarter with outstanding growth.  it has an FDA decision in January and its share price has risen from just under $15 a share to over $18 since it released earnings on 11/1.  This stock has no real problems at this time but I guess we try to sall be fortune tellers as to where it is going.  Good Luck with that.  In the world of Biotech I focus on the product.  Does the product work well, does it sell and does the company creating it and selling it make money.  With Cabo and Exel the answer to that Trifecta is ""Yes"". As far as money flow and Insider ownership with these companies does not factor in much with me.  Nor does the number of outstanding shares as most Biotechs have to issue lots of shares to stay out of debt and finish their drug trials.  With the answer being ""Yes"" to my 3 questions this is a stock I will hold for years to come. Cabo works. The results behind prove that and their will be much more of those results to come going forward.  In the world of Biotech when you find the companies that have a good product and it sells and allows them to be profitable well then you have the best of all worlds.  Cabo is strong and the sales results for the last 6 qtrs along with Exel's cash reserve now up to $750 million screams loud and clear in proving that.  After next qtr it will be 7 qtrs in a row of beating estimates and increasing our cash pile.  Making money like they are I see a buyout of Exel in the future not threats of competition.  Treating Cancer is a huge field full of competitors but the drugs that work and Cabo works will have billions of $ in yearly sales even with competition.  That is a fact just look at Opdivo and Keytruda and Cabo is just starting and coming on strong.  GLTA",
"Regardless of the science, look at that chart!",
High float could continue to put a ceiling on the stock price. My two cents. Slow and steady. Good luck to all.,
Everyone keeps predicting that Cabo sales are going to down with competition yet sales just continue to rise.  I guess if you keep predicting negativity about their sales it may eventually become true.  I mean even a loser gets it right sometimes.  I have a problem with this author having no stake in the game with EXEL but he has his opinion.  Well for what it is worth I have an opinion too and that opinion is that you are wrong and that Cabo sales will continue to grow for longer than you are an Author on Seeking Alpha.,
"While it may get complicated, I think Cabo+nivo combo will be gold standard in 1L and each individually will prove to be superior than ipilimumab. Side effects for cabo will be predictable and manageable as seen with other tki’s. Ipilimumab will likely jump in for refractory cases as a triple therapy with dose reductions in Cabo/nivo to avoid toxicity. Furthermore,in patients with co-morbid conditions like RCC,HCC,  MTC, MENs, osteosarcomas or bone mets will demand cabo front line over all other options. If forced with difficult/complicated treatment options without cookie cutter guidelines, doctors would likely prioritize a solo high dose monotherapy cabo over lower dose combos for best tumor response rate and a delay in disease progression till toxicity/burden became too high . At that point, they would be cut off and flipped to a combo therapy excluding cabo due to safety issues. While it may not be perfect, I do think there will be an obvious enough clinical response to prioritize high dose cabo till burden , even if that means only for a month or two.",
seems like upside is capped,

Why are folks talking about a recession so much?  None of the leading indicators are pointing in that direction.  These will typically point downward 3-9 months before a recession.  Australia has gone 28 years without a recession.  Buy stocks of companies that you think are undervalued and have good prospects.  Don't worry too much about the 10-12% of the time we're in a recession.,

As the stock market descended into a bear market bottoming in October 2002 and testing that bottom in March 2003 as gulf war 2 broke out, Cameco's stock rose consistently throughout and then really took off with the new bull market's second thrust beginning in March 2003.",

(BBBY) has decided to keep a longtime director on its board despite investors voting three months ago to unseat her.The home-goods retailer said Thursday it rejected Victoria A. Morrison's resignation from the board after investors voted to oust the director at the company's annual shareholder meeting in June.Under the company's rules, Ms. Morrison submitted her resignation following the certification of the election results. The company then has the option of accepting or rejecting the resignation.The board, according to a regulatory filing, later ""determined that the acceptance of Ms. Morrison's resignation would not be in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders and voted unanimously not to accept her resignation.""The board made the decision, without Ms. Morrison's participation, considering her qualifications and experience, such as in strategic planning and real-estate transactions, the company said.Ms. Morrison is a lawyer who has served on the board since 2001. She is general counsel of real-estate company Edison Properties LLC.Under the company's rules, Ms. Morrison submitted her resignation following the certification of the election results. The company then has the option of accepting or rejecting the resignation.In a rare public protest, investors cast about 60.5 million votes against Ms. Morrison's re-election compared with 48 million in favor, the company had said in June. Separately, in a nonbinding vote, shareholders also rejected the company's executive-pay plan. The result came after proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended that shareholders withhold their vote from members of Bed Bath & Beyond's(BBBY) compensation committee, which included Ms. Morrison.On Thursday, Bed Bath & Beyond(BBBY) said it would accept Ms. Morrison's resignation from the board's compensation committee.However, Ms. Morrison, will remain a member of the board's nominating and governance committee, the company said. Bed Bath & Beyond(BBBY) said Ms. Morrison is part of the board's ongoing ""refreshment initiative,"" which has resulted in three new directors joining the board since 2017. The initiative is expected to result in more changes to the board's composition, the company said.On Wednesday, Bed Bath & Beyond(BBBY) reported revenue growth was roughly flat in the latest quarter as the retailer experienced a drop in store sales, missing analysts' expectations for profit and comparable sales.Shares in the Union, N.J.-based company, which operates under banners such as Bed Bath & Beyond(BBBY), Harmon Face Values and buybuy BABY, fell 21% to $14.86 in Thursday trading.Shares in the company are down 36% in the last year.Write to Aisha Al-Muslim at aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires09-27-181819ETCopyright (c) 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.---------------------Victoria A.

"Wayfair is a wall-street dream. It might come true. It might not. Management doesn't care because they will get rich regardless. Negative net income would even be worse than it horrendously is if you consider negligible interest rates on convertible debt. What if they were paying real interest rates on real bonds? Double digits? Tack that onto operations and see what things look like. The convertible notes defer cost of capital into a future of diluted shares. That's how I see it anyways. Please someone tell me if I'm not looking at that correctly. They need to borrow half a billion a year and growing. How much longer will wall street have an appetite for their convertible notes?

"$W has really pulled the wool over everyone's eyes with that ""growing repeat customer"" chart.  Their problem is slowing growth.  Of course that would increase a growing share of repeat users but it's not a good thing.  Despite all their protests about how huge TAM is, their slowing growth shows a much lower ceiling in reality.That leaves growing existing users and growing margins.  User spend is growing and that's definitely a positive.  But of course, at zero or negative margin, that means that the value of the acquisition is still negative!It looks like the only thing shorts have gotten wrong is that  some of the money spent on advertising is actually also used to get customers to come back and not only on new customers.  But either way, that's moving chairs around the titantic.  Losses are losses and there is zero sign of scale or operating leverage despite all the years of growth.",

There have been some very interesting conspiratorial views posted on Youtube. Energy weapons have been sighted by them. Which I personally find interesting. Houses burnt to ash from the inside out and cars melted with green trees right next to them. How does that happen? PCG looks innocent of any wrong doing. Something very sinister is going on.,
The cause was irresponsible management of dead brush and adequate controlled fires. That falls squarely on the heads of legislators and misguided environmentalists.,
"Fuel and spark, that's the math. CA is responsible for the fuel. While there may be some shared liability with PCG I wouldn't buy into the emotionalism surrounding the ""cause"". The lead story has pretty well been pretty well juked by a ""dewey, cheatem and how"" law firm looking to cash in. They won't succeed but it if they can get enough suckers to finance the legal bill, their revenues should be healthy for a few years.",
"Need a metric like CAPEX except for political investment, perhaps POLEX.  Political calculations will play a big part in the final score.

Cynical?  You bet.  Look at the gas riots in France and watch who will suffer for the ever expanding gas tax.",

PCG isn't causing the fires.  There are many other reasons fires can start.  PCG should fight all these allocations.  I think CA state gov is highly responsible for not doing a better job of forest management.  It hasn't rained in southern CA in years.  6 years of drought  conditions and anyone dropping a cig and a broken bottle could start a fire.PCG stop being a scapegoat !,
"I believe the State will bail both PCG and EIX out and PCG's stock price will return to the 40's within the next 9 months - nearly doubling from current levels.Why bail? Because the State knows neither PCG nor EIX can afford to hire the manpower required to inspect and monitor countless thousands of aging utility poles, towers and wires and the trees next to them, hence future periodic serious utility company equipment sparked fire events are inevitable.Although the fire season in California will end tomorrow with the arrival of drenching rains, I personally won't invest more than a modest amount in PCG, despite the 50-100% upside, because California is over due for a massive earthquake in the SF Bay Area that could cause PCG's stock price to crash back into the 20's.  Northern and inland utilties like IDA and NWE are far less risky and have 25% upside if a larger utility were to buy them out.",
Why buy a utility with no dividend?  Unless you are betting on a short term correction I don't see the appeal here.  There is way too much risk / not enough reward here.  I can sort of understand a contrarian considering buying the bonds for cheap but.. better deals elsewhere in this market.,
Anybody give blame to the regulations that prevent the clearing of the underbrush and dead trees and branches that create the bulk of the fuel to the fires. Hard to get control of any fire with this much explosive fuel available to it.,

LOL !From my article on Icahn and $IEPseekingalpha.com/...Read his precise statement when he sold 20 million shares (post-split, or 10 million pre-split) in the recent (May ’18) Dutch auction or tender offer by HLF. Note that Icahn’s intention to exit HLF is supported by the fact that he tendered his entire holding of 46 million shares in the tender offer, although only a quarter was accepted.Icahn's recent sale (May 25, ’18) points unequivocally to his stance on Herbalife:For almost six years, we have been one of Herbalife’s strongest, most loyal supporters; we stood by the Company through a half-decade long short-selling campaign; and we never sold a share, even after our investment doubled. But, given that our Herbalife investment has become an outsized position, representing approximately 24% exposure to total NAV, it is only prudent for IEP to reduce its exposure.IEP’s investment in Herbalife is a quintessential example of our activist investment strategy. In late 2012 and early 2013, when Herbalife was under attack and the stock was out of favour, we studied the business and assessed the risks. At that time, we concluded the risk/reward ratio was very favourable.The last sentence, is key: “At that time, we concluded the risk/reward ratio was very favourable”. By virtue of his $600 million sale in May '18, it is logical that Icahn now believes - after the dramatic appreciation since 2013 - that the risk/reward ratio now points to a reduction of, if not an outright exit from, Herbalife. In addition, in order to retain the tax status of IEP, he is forced to reduce his ""investments"" and increase his operated and controlled assets - this by April '19.""@blacky_  @Davey Johnson @Jeffjacobjames you think Icahn will pay a premium on current price of $57?Icahn didn't become a global corporate titan from absurd decisions.He KNOWS HLF is cornered.

If he does that, he WINS in two ways:-he solves IEP's tax problem by controlling HLF-he exploits the trap on existing shareholders-he knows NOONE will buy his 35m shares, so he CANT sell them.-he gets a bargain, knowing it's POSSIBLY worth more about $40, if HLF can carry on duping the FTC.Watch this space.",

"Old Analyst: {That again gets back to the only logical conclusions they can reach which are: 1. Before the FTC, HLF was lying about the survey that showed a huge percentage of discount buyers, and …} seekingalpha.com/...The FTC characterized “the survey that showed a huge percentage of discount buyers” as “flawed and unreliable”. “99. DEFENDANTS’ [Herbalife’s] EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CLAIM THAT A “SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY” OF THEIR DISTRIBUTORS ARE NOT PURSUING THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IS BASED NOT ON DISTRIBUTOR BEHAVIOR, BUT ON SURVEYS COMMISSIONED BY DEFENDANTS BEGINNING IN JULY 2012 THAT ARE FLAWED AND UNRELIABLE. For example, many survey participants who were included in the category of Distributors who purportedly “joined Herbalife primarily as discount customers” themselves reported that they quit Herbalife because “finding new customers was too difficult and/or time consuming,” or the “business was harder than [they] originally believed.”100. Based on such survey results, even some Distributors who reach “President’s Team” (the highest status level in Herbalife) and earn over $100,000 in recruiting rewards annually from the business opportunity have been categorized in Defendants’ representations as merely “discount buyers.”101. When OBSERVABLE DISTRIBUTOR BEHAVIOR FROM DEFENDANTS’ DATA is analyzed, the percentage of Distributors who are attempting to earn income from the Herbalife business opportunity readily exceeds the 27% in Defendants’ claims. Such behaviors include, for example, purchasing promotional literature and sales and recruiting aids from Defendants.102. Furthermore, many Distributors interested in the business opportunity may make some effort to earn income and fail, without engaging in the type of measureable and overt behaviors that would make their pursuit of the business opportunity readily apparent.103. In short, many of the Distributors whom Defendants would expressly or impliedly characterize as solely “discount buyers” are, in fact, pursuing the business opportunity.104. Regardless of the number of so-called “discount buyers,” it is clear that collectively they could account for only a small percentage of the volume of Defendants’ products sold in the United States. EVEN USING A GROSSLY OVERSTATED MEASURE OF “DISCOUNT BUYERS”—THAT IS, COUNTING AS “DISCOUNT BUYERS” THE ROUGHLY 80% OF PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE NOT “SALES LEADERS”—SUCH DISTRIBUTORS COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN 25% OF THE VOLUME OF DEFENDANTS’ PRODUCTS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES. The remainder, over 75%, is purchased by Distributors at the “Sales Leader” level, who are clearly pursuing a business opportunity.” [emphases added] www.ftc.gov/... (pp.28 & 29)And “Surprise, surprise, surprise, Drill Sargent! Those flawed and unreliable surveys yielded results which were skewed 180 degrees in favor of Herbalife’s otherwise unsubstantiated claims. Garbage in always results in garbage out. Some would call the formulation and interpretation of those surveys “lying”. I call it self-serving and deceptive.Old Analyst: {… 2. HLF is lying NOW about the retail sales numbers }As pertains to Herbalife’s current sales numbers: In a 17 June, 2017 press release, Herbalife reported that “due to the dedication and diligence of its distributors, in May, 90 percent of United States sales were documented purchases by consumers, comprised of more than three million receipted retail transactions. These results far exceed the 80 percent threshold called for in the Company's agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The Company also announced that approximately 400,000 customers have converted or signed up as preferred members in the U.S. since the program began in October 2016.” ir.herbalife.com/...Yet in it’s “Regional Supplemental Metrics - Reclassified for 6 Regions Q3 2018” the company reports a total of 117,818 new Preferred Members recruited in quarters one and two of 2017 + IIRC more than 33,000 (we’ll round up to 40,000 to suit your optimism) Sales Leaders who converted to Preferred Memberships in Q4, 2016 + 38,450 fewer Sales Leaders in Quarters one and two in 2017, and assuming all of the Sales Leaders who did not requalify converted to Preferred Memberships Herbalife hosted 196,268 Preferred Members at the end of Q2, 2017. ir.herbalife.com/... My calculator could be wrong; but it says that Herbalife’s press release overstated its U.S. Preferred Member contingent by at least 203.8%.Herbalife and its principals have been masters of deception since the company’s founding thirty-eight years ago; and that includes the years the company has been under scrutiny by the FTC. This was clearly evinced from the beginning by founder, Mark Hughes’ oft-stated counsel to the company’s recruiters: “FAKE it ‘til you make it.” And consistent with its hubris and long-standing history of deception, Herbalife was clearly deceptive before “the FTC”; and its deceptive proclivities don’t appear to have changed “one iota” since.",
"Old Analyst: {The reality is that NO ONE COULD EVER FIND REAL EVIDENCE OF INVENTORY LOADING.} seekingalpha.com/...That “reality” has no basis in fact. Here is what the FTC found in the course of its twenty-seven-month investigation into Herbalife’s fraudulent business practices — findings Herbalife has never contested:“72. Regardless of whether Distributors operate a Nutrition Club, Distributors experience difficulty in selling product to customers outside the network. Nevertheless, Defendants’ compensation structure puts pressure on Distributors to purchase large quantities of product in order to qualify for greater wholesale discounts and recruiting-based rewards [front-end inventory loading] (see discussion below at ¶¶ 135– 44).73. As a result, many Distributors buy product that they find difficult to sell. Although Defendants have a buy-back policy, in order to take advantage of the policy, a Distributor must resign his distributorship. Many Distributors have been unaware of the policy or, for various reasons, have been reluctant to attempt to use it.74. Distributors dispose of excess product purchases in numerous ways. At the simplest level, when DISTRIBUTORS ARE LEFT WITH PRODUCT THEY ARE UNABLE TO SELL [aka front-loaded inventory] they may GIVE IT TO FRIENDS, THROW IT AWAY, OR GRADUALLY CONSUME IT THEMSELVES. Such self-consumption is NOT DRIVEN BY GENUINE DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCT, but is the easiest and most convenient way for a Distributor to get some benefit from product that the Distributor would not have bought absent his or her participation in the business opportunity. In other instances Distributors ATTEMPT TO SELL THEIR EXCESS INVENTORY [loads] AT A DISCOUNT ON AUCTION WEBSITES OR AT FLEA MARKETS, although such efforts to mitigate their losses are prohibited by Defendants’ rules. [Herbalife Rules of Conduct 4.1.1, 7.3] 75. The overwhelming majority of Distributors who attempt to retail the product make little or no net income, or even lose money, from retailing the product.” [emphases added] www.ftc.gov/... (pg. 22)Old analyst: {I don't recall anyone ever finding a single ""garage full of product"" or equivalent. The FTC had limited resources to look, and they couldn't find any. Their complaint was based on the proposition that there must be some, even though we can't find any. But, as I said, they had limited resources to try to find it.}You don’t recall anyone ever finding a single ""garage full of product"" or equivalent” because anyone even remotely familiar with Herbalife’s products understands that a Sales – Leader - qualifying inventory load would occupy at most, two 18” X 48” shelves in a common wheeled shelving unit — far less than a “garage full”. So, the notion that the FTC or any rational person would have searched for garages full of product is utterly ludicrous.Old Analyst: {On the other hand, in the process of spending $100 mm to kill the company, you can be sure Ackman engaged in an intense search. He had -- and spent -- plenty of resources. In fact, at least some of the payoffs to Hispanic interest groups was to try to get their members to find and report on those ""full garages"". Ackman couldn't find any, either. A logical conclusion from those FACTS is that there just wasn't any inventory loading -- oh, maybe a little, but nothing at all systematic.}In context, it’s no surprise that the only original source I can find for your purported “FACTS” re. the futile search for garages full of unsaleable Herbalife product is your own SA commentary in support of Herbalife’s economically irrational sales and distribution system.BTW: Don’t you post articles and comments on SA under color of a Charter CFA?

"Old Analyst: {As usual, the critics … never explained why someone who couldn't sell the product would care about losing her ""distributorship"".} seekingalpha.com/...How can you possibly know that when you have some of “the critics” muted? As a matter of fact, one such critic has several times explained exactly why distributors who couldn’t sell “the product” would care about losing their distributorships. Here’s a detailed explanation that even someone incapable of abstract thinking should be able to understand:1. MLM culture discourages distributors from forfeiting their distributorships for any reason. An old MLM mantra goes like this: “Winners never quit; and quitters never win. Herbalife piled onto that cultural “mandate” by deploying myriad means and instrumentalities to its recruiters, clearly implying that persistence in the face of financial failure will eventually pay off. www.ftc.gov/... (pp. 5 — 17)2. Retail non-store MLM distributorships operated as sole proprietorships incur unrecoverable incremental operating costs every year. IRS data from 2014 suggest that those reasonable and customary costs (exclusive of COGS) range from an average of ~$8,800 for distributors who claimed a net loss to an average of ~$10,300 for those who declared a net profit. So, distributors who forfeit their distributorships by returning ANY PORTION of unsold product for refund also have to kiss that money goodbye. Yet, Herbalife clearly implies that the only cost of starting a distributorship is the refundable cost of purchasing an international business pack. edge.myherbalife.com/... (pg. 4)One need not stray from SA’s Herbalife discussion fora to find hundreds of comments posted by willfully ignorant MLM acolytes claiming that the incremental operating expenses for an MLM distributorship are at most, de minimis — if they exist at all. And that’s only a small part of the unsubstantiated pro-MLM noise that “industry” tries to foist onto the public, in part to influence distributors to hang on to the MLM dream of financial independence, despite all the unrefuted objective evidence and sound logic that exposes it for the delusion it is.3. That dream is fueled by the prospect of great wealth ensuing from Herbalife’s hyper-leveraged “income opportunity”. The FTC’s Complaint against Herbalife includes a table which illustrates the extent of hyper-leveraging afforded to Herbalife’s successful recruiters:“Wholesale Profits, $2,847 Royalty Overrides, $944,058 (guaranteed payments on downline purchases)Production Bonuses, $4,256,817 (guaranteed payments on purchases by up to three succeeding downline levels)Mark Hughes Bonus, $2,000,000 (eligibility contingent on downline purchases)Total, $7,203,722” www.ftc.gov/... (pg.35)That is a powerful (some would say “irresistible”) counter inducement for an Herbalife distributor to forfeit her/his distributorship, and in the course thereof, giving up her/his ability to build and retain a downline. In fact, the evidence suggests that their more likely course would be to throw even more money after bad by investing in Herbalife’s futile “Circle of Success” programs — HOMs, STS’s and Extravaganzas.All that spurious noise conspires to trigger the “SUNK-COST FALLACY” in a failing distributor’s thinking. (The sunk cost fallacy is “… the idea that a company or organization is more likely to continue with a project if they have already invested a lot of money, time, or effort in it, even when continuing is not the best thing to do: Economists would point out that the sunk cost fallacy is irrational, and could be described as ‘throwing good money after bad’.”  dictionary.cambridge.org/... They are among the  ~90% (at last report in 2009) of non-sales leaders who run out of financial resources, or for other reasons quit by the end of their first year in the business.4.  Herbalife incents upline recruiters to discourage product returns for refund by distributors in their downlines as a byproduct of justifiably clawing back royalty overrides and production bonuses paid out on products later returned for refund. This may also disqualify marginal Sales Leaders from any future royalty overrides and downline retention, until/unless they can offset those lost downline purchases with purchases by new recruits. If they lose their qualification for those hyper-leveraged Sales-Leader rewards, they have to petition the company to re-enroll and build a new downline from scratch.By conditioning refunds for product returns on distributorship forfeiture, Herbalife takes full advantage of the sunk-cost fallacy to coerce distributors to retain unsaleable product until the twelve-month return window is closed.",
"@blacky_   @Shorty H. As I've said in the past, I respect both of your positions.  We don't agree, but, at this stage you have money on the line and I don't.BTW, I don't know if you noticed (or care)...  I just did a SUCCESSFUL short-term trade of HLF!

Notable ONLY because it's one of the very few successful short-term trades I've ever done!It was kinda fun!P.S.  I am a terrible short-term trader, rarely do it and even much more rarely have a success at it.  I mentioned in the past that I'd occassionally tried to trade around my base HLF long.  I did it maybe 3 or 4 times in a couple of years.  I lost money every time I did it.  So, no one should ever do what I do short-term!",
"Happy Christmas to everyone!Has an HLF long been the best stock in your portfolio?Since the S&P 500 peak and HLF's peak, the S&P is down about 20% and HLF is down a little over 7%.  No one likes to lose money, but my guess is that, for those institutions that hold HLF long it has probably been one of the best performers in their portfolios for the year.  No one likes to lose money absolutely, of course, but institutions thrive on RELATIVE performance and, for 2018 HLF has been an All-Star!Personally, I'm kind of startled at that.  A month or more ago I guessed in these fora that HLF would be much more volatile than the market on the downside.  I guessed that shorts would do well if the market had a sharp selloff -- the market did (still is maybe) but shorts didn't.  I don't have the tools available to readily calculate the stock's Beta, but my guess is it's gone down a lot over the last couple of years.Where is SS to tell us that the stock will crash soon because of the most recent OBV statistics?  Where is he at all?  He's been AWOL on the HLF boards for a while now.  Could he have finally changed from a self-dexribed long suffering short to one who has covered and gone?  BTW, I peaked at his recent activity and he seems to have done really well (being serious now) with some of his FAANG and related tech shorts, so he's likely having a good year.  Where is everyone else?   o  It seems like the SJWs are long gone -- it seems like they have run out of accusations and other things to say.o  Are there any real shorts still on the board?o  Have all those screaming ""unfair"" or ""evil"" or ""payoffs"" or ""corruption"" or ""politics"" or ""Ackman was right"" finally given up?Back in the very, very old days, one of Wall Street's favorite ""indicators"" was to look at Odd Lot behavior.  This was in the days when all commissions were fixed and the standard purchase or sale was 100 shares, unlike these days when you can buy/sell any number of shares you want with no differentiation.  There used to be an ""Odd Lot Differential"" -- If you bought or sold an Odd Lot, you paid or were chared an extra 1/8th (before stocks were traded in ""cents"" they were traded in ""1/8ths"" - .125 cents).  Anyway, Odd Lot statistics were reported every day.  Nearly all Odd Lots were retail investors who couldn't afford or didn't want to buy 100 shares minimum.  Professionals made the assumption that Odd Lotters were usually wrong -- which was a statistically good assumption on average but like all statistics had plenty of examples of being wrong.  The Odd Lot Indicator was that if there was a pattern of what Odd Lotters were doing, the way to make money was to do the opposite.There is really no equivalent of Odd Lot statistics today.  With machines and HFTs responsible for most trading, Odd Lotters get lost in the shuffle.  I wonder if SA can become the new ""Odd Lot Indicator""?  Try to measure the average sentiment of SA and do the opposite?  Who knows.  But, for years the average HLF sentiment on SA was dominated by critics and shorts with a few longs and apoligists included.  The latter group scored a dominant victory.  Now, everyone is gone.  The winners have, for the most part, counted their winnings and moved on.  The losers seem to have covered and also gone.  The critics -- largely SJWs -- could not have been bigger losers but at worst they only hurt their egos, not their pocketbooks;  in fact, they are so fundamedntalist about their beliefs that their egos probably never get dented as they are 100% sure they are 100% right 100% of the time -- even when they're not.So, is SA the new Odd Lot Indicator for HLF?  If it is, it's probably time to short.  But the Odd Lot Indicator was never in and of itself a stand-alone indicator and it actually had only a modest batting average at best.I'll close as usual...  No one knows the future and everything can change tomorrow.",

(HLF)|By: Douglas W. House, SA News EditorHerbalife Nutrition (NYSE:HLF) Q3 results ($M): Sales: 1,242.8 (+14.5%).Net income: 71.2 (+30.6%); non-GAAP net income: 105.6 (+56.0%); EPS: 0.49 (+48.5%); non-GAAP EPS: 0.74 (+80.5%); cash flow ops (9 mo.): 509.7 (+26.0%).Volume points: 1506.9 (+15.0%); North America: 309.3 (+18.3%); EMEA: 303.1(+17.1%); Asia Pacific: 346.5 (+24.3%); Mexico: 233.0 (+9.2%); South & Central America: 138.2 (-8.0%); China: 176.8 (+19.6%).Q4 guidance: Volume point growth: 8.0 - 12.0%; sales growth: 6.5 - 10.5%; EPS: $0.35 - 0.45; non-GAAP EPS: $0.50 - 0.60 versus current Street range of $0.61 - 0.72 and consensus of $0.68.2018 guidance: Volume point growth: 8.6 - 9.6%; sales growth: 9.9 - 10.9%; EPS: $1.99 - 2.09; non-GAAP EPS: $2.74 - 2.84.2019 Guidance: Volume point growth: 4.0 - 8.0%; sales growth: 2.8 - 6.8%; EPS: $2.34 - 2.74; non-GAAP EPS: $2.70 - 3.10.The key to HLF's future is, IMO, top line growth.  According to the report, real sales (not VPs, which are useful despite criticism, but I'm avoiding that) are up +14.5% and guidance for next year is +2.8 - +6.8%.  And, as I believe, they would be stupid to forecast a number that didn't include close to 100% confidence on their part.So, what are the factors showing ""declining fundamentals""?  Historical numbers are history and already baked in.  The future certainly looks like continued growth.I don't get it.  Seriously.  Can someone explain why future fundamentals should be declining?It's substantial.  You can only cover up so much with cost cutting.",
Source...HLF website. 50% make $95 before expenses and 39% make less than $95 before expenses. I think 89% warrants vast. Also look at the website and the required FTC settlement info disappears than reappears. Again making a joke of the requirement,
Icahn has made a billion+ $ on the backs of society's most vulnerable and unrepresented.  Although his initial investment was made solely to punish Ackman it also gave HLF credibility and the ability to continue the fraud.  Te vast majority of recruits are still losing their life savings. HLF has made a joke of the FTC order and as long as Icahn remains a significant shareholder the FTC will not make any additional moves.  The FTC is treating Icahn the same way the SEC treated Madoff for all those years.  If you read Christine Richard's latest piece that highlights the number of questionable characters involved for so many years you have to believe that this is a protected company.,
"Just for reference Dillweed, I asked an HLF dist if I could help them grow their instagram (less than 1000 followers) and provide a way to order online easily via goherbalife.  They already had that set up with Paypal or some merchant.  The net results, 7 new retail clients in a very short period of time.  The average sale was over $200.  I can't see how this would be a struggle for anyone that is reasonably fit/in-shape and a decent following on instagram.  But hey, that's me",
The Herbalife shorts here offer only old rehashed stories over and over again for 4 Years now ....as Herbalife has successfully regained its growth .Thats why none are invested short... Amen,

"@Milkweed You know my position on Herbalife and MLM's in general, but that is separate to the question of investing.Herbalife has operated under the auspices of the ""independent auditor"" in complete secrecy for over a year with no visible consequences.  As long as they can continue to operate in such an opaque manner I don't think things will change.  What is the catalyst to bring about change in your mind?As an aside I'm eagerly awaiting the new ""Statement of Average Gross Compensation"" which will be a year old on Nov 28th and due for a refresh. Always fun to deconstruct that piece of statistical malfeasance.",
The real problem is there are about 15 Million dedicated active people Involved in MLM in the USA .. Amway is over 70 years old and Herbalife is pushing 40 . MLM has been part of America since the Fuller Brush Salesmen ...Most MLMs have  a small cost to enter for a part time business .. If you do not like Salesmen then you might hate MLM ..I would  not bet against the MLMers  True Believers.. They love their products,
"Is a retail business, a retail business if you personally don't participate in the retail selling part of that business? We could discuss for months my friend Shorty H, in the end, neither of us will see the same side of the coin. Nothing is perfect, i appreciate your concerns, and your articulate questions, Today rewards are based on documented retail sales, I think that is a good thing.",
"watdahek, I asked: ""Do you believe that it was ever Herbalife's policy, business model, or practice to pay its distributors rewards that were not based on retails sales to end consumers?"" And you said: ""Yes, it was not their policy, to pay not based on retail sales."" I assume you meant: ""No, it was not the company's policy to pay its participants rewards that were not based on retail sales."" But, if that is what you meant, Chairman's Club Member Stephan Gratziani said: ""The Herbalife business model, at this point in time, is not based on customers purchasing--it's based on distributors purchasing volume. That is the Herbalife business model. That is the way that it works."" So my question to you is this: Is a reward that is based on the amount of volume a distributor purchases from the company the same as a reward that is based on a retail sale to an end consumer, or is it different?  Also, if a MLM that pays its participants rewards for buying volume, and the money from those purchases flows up the participants' downline, and the retail business opportunity isn't viable, do you think the participants are incentivized to recruit new participants into their downline or to engage in an actual retail business? Now, ask yourself if the participants engage in recruiting more participants into their downlines but don't actually engage in the retail side of their business, do you think that's really a retail business or a recruiting business? Now, with that in mind, ask yourself what you think Michael Johnson meant by the following quote? ""We're still a recruiting company, and we've got to never not be this.""",
"Hey Shorty H, sorry i missed this...""Do you believe that it was ever Herbalife's policy, business model, or practice to pay its distributors rewards that were not based on retails sales to end consumers?""Yes, it was not their policy, to pay not based on retail sales.If a member purchases, its either for personal consumption or retail sales. If Members didn't send their 10 customer form in, ( compliance) then HLF didn't pay. Today technology, and stricter rules, mean all customers purchases are documented. Which may seam a restriction, and a damaging factor, however the compliance has helped HLF be better, and more successful. So much so, other countries are starting to follow similar guidelines, as good business practices, not compliance issues...",
"Hey Shorty H, """"The Commission found that"" the explanation of a pyramid system like this is correct. However ""the right to receive, in return for recruiting other participants "" this is the area most get confused. Does this mean receive a reward just for the act of introducing you to the company? mmm this is what i would call ""pyramid"" Making money on this act. HLF does not do this. However if I introduce you to a company, and I help you put 100$ in your pocket, would you be against me earning 10$ for having done this? If I ""recruit"" and teach 100 people, I get paid 1000$, Does this look like I'm being a scam artist? .....Stefan Graziani....told the truth in that moment....it was just the mechanics of how members got paid. Customers buy from members, who buy from the company, who pays the commission the next month. ..........""We're still a recruiting company, and we've got to never not be this."" Every company recruits. Basketball teams recruit....nothing wrong with this. Recruiting alone does nothing, and earns nothing. Recruiting, is find someone who is willing to work, then its necessary to teach and train  for sustainable results. Would you want to take away my right to train others? Whats amazing, is some students surpass their Maestro...While Ackman was having his tantrum, a young couple from Cuba, in the USA, saw a chance to stop working in bars, and in 7 years hit record levels. In the end you see life through your eyes so think what suits you, but If HLF survived this un precedented attack, its because people believe in it. Its because its more than just money.",
"""it's about the only logical explanation I can come up with for how they managed the unbelievable transition from no significant reward-able sales to 70% reward-able sales in 10 months under a consent decree to overhaul their business plan"" ....Its Unbelievable but its a fact. HLF said that many members were discounted customers, at that time. Retail Customers are not included in that calculation, if your only looking at actual members. During the 10 months, many customers, old or new were given the new option, of preferred customer. So what was Known before, but not documented, became documented. A preferred member is limited to the amount they purchase, you have already stated this, so your opinion ""You can then keep up the coerced inventory loading and report it all as reward-able sales."" has absolutely no sense. Inventory loading....mmm... I can understand where your concern is, but if i buy a car, change my mind and sell it immediately..would i get ALL my money back? So if i decide to start my own business, a shop, I decorate it, get stock, everything i need... change my mind.. do I get all my money back??.... Could I afford to open a business? .. If i have NO money, at the end of the month because I've a JOB... what chance do I have of starting a small business, to make ends meet??...NONE!!! MLM however opens a door, and HLF gives you your money back if you change your mind. You may or not agree with my opinion, but even after all this BS on TV, online etc...HLF is producing record sales...even if your a half wit, you can see, that most people  don't think like you. Don't get me wrong, being critical is fine, being blind isn't.",
The Longs are the Clear winners here .. The Shorts lost on Herbalife ... That is undeniable,
"A couple of questions...Did the term ""coerced comsumption"" ever show up in the FTC Order?  If not, where does it come from?Did the FTC ever find any evidence of Inventory Loading, or did they build a construct that said, effectively, it must be there even though we can't find it?Is the company making fraudlent claims of greater than 80% retail sales?  If so, isn't there some sort of whistleblower law somewhere that could lead the author -- or others -- to make a fortune?",

"You guys that lost money are so salty. Walk away already, start a gratitude journal to find some happiness or something. Spend this time you wasted, maybe on researching other companies to make money from? This ship has sailed chief. 👋🏼",
"I think the FTC will not provide any relief. So all this assessment may be correct but under trump there is just no hard hand to manage companies that scam off poor people. After all this is America. However I do really believe strongly that the very interesting case of $HLF will manage itself. With the increasing debt, buybacks at insane (!) evaluations and the reduced cash flow - always talking about GAAP - this monster will come down eventually. Even the tax reform will not change anything about that. So yes, Ackmann was wrong about the timing. But the basic idea was right. Even though he may not be a good person (who is judging?) he got the facts 100% straight. So I remain comfortably short knowing that a.) need enough patience (years) and b.) enough liquidity (this price may not be the highest; in the contrary). Why did I say comfortably? Well because EVERYTHING you throw up will come down. there is just no (!) fundamental logic that supports the current long case at this PRICE. So all I do is wait for a correction based on FUNDAMENTALS. After all how can $HLF be valued (P/E) as high as google? :)",
"Let's see the FTC enforce anything at all. Unlikely. Meanwhile the settlement left unfettered recruiting in place and as long as that is the case, the business remains a pyramid scheme.",
Herbalife 37 years old .... Seems MLMs last a long time with good products,
"Great Article, The FTC agreed to leave out the word Pyramid Scheme in the Complaint and that is why distributors didn’t flee in mass, public companies with political connections are allowed to commit fraud IF the victims are low income and/or immigrants. Bill Ackman is right, you are right I was right in my article about Herbalife but the FTC has to enforce the injunction.",
"I think we all know that MLMs envy traditional companies and their ability to actually sell products to complete strangers (ie; the public).  Most MLMs start out with noble intentions, however they are victims of human nature.  Why sell to a stranger when its exponentially easier to sell to new recruits seeking to prove their loyalty.  That fact makes their rewardable sales turnaround even more unbelievable because its actually completely out of their control.  Furthermore, their classification system is a moot point because people can jump back and forth from distributor to preferred client depending on whether they've had a sale that month or not.  The true definition of an inactive distributor is a distributor without a sale....not as a preferred client.And who exactly is auditing the identities of anyone at all?  The fact the FTC only got involved because of public pressure stirred by Ackman only proves the point that some, or all MLMs, are legal only because the FTC operates with their head in the sand intentionally to serve their well-lobbied political masters.",
"There was lawsuits filed in Miami by possibly more than 100,000 distributors, possibly could be as much as $1 billion in damages per this article, www.newsmax.com/... not sure the case has been moved to California or dismissed.",

[Herbalife settled with the FTC agreeing to a $200M fine]It was restitution or redress to the consumer and not a fine.  You will call it splitting hairs but I call it misleading because you like the connotation of the word fine.,
"[Ackman and Munger were right about the business.]Sure, one invested in PrePaid Legal and the other owns Pampered Chef.  Both mirror HLF in more ways than not but they found those investments acceptable.  I'll put that in the category where I was told I could keep my doctor and my premiums would go down.",
"The problems with the current FTC enforcement position, based on the 1979 Amway case, is that a company structured as a pyramid - with exponential recruiting - can still be legal if it has retail sales, a buy back policy, and ten separate monthly retail customers. The base problem is that, prior to the Amway case, the basic structure of a pyramid had been considered inherently deceptive by the FTC - mainly because it's sales plan offered chain based exponential opportunity which must fail when there are no more potential recruits. This seems to be borne out by the fact that over 99% or all distributors fail.The fundamental problem with the FTC position is that, since all distributors are independent contractors, the MLM has no meaningful means of obtaining truthful retail reports by its distributors, who also fear FTC enforcement if they have no retail sales. From an enforcement standpoint, this creates an impossible situation. First and foremost is the fact that the existence or non-existence of retail sales cannot be determined until the damage has already been done. Secondly, to some extent, the FTC has to prove there are no retail sales, not the other way around.We've all been over this before, but it seems worthwhile to look into an enforcement posture through which MLMs have been able to currently have annual revenues of about $178 billion from the 90 countries in which they operate. That is a lot of money which has ridden on the back of an unprovable and after the fact premise.",
Ackman and Munger were right about the business. But Ackman was wrong about the stock. I'd avoid the stock on both sides (long and short).,
"I remember the day when Ackman started all his bad bet against Herbalife. Since the very first day I knew he was wrong. I followed all the theatrical he performed for 5 years and I was happy to see I was right.Nobody knows better the reality than somebody which is open minded, sound and with integrity. Herbalife Nutrition is stronger than ever before. The stock will climb back to 80 even 90 regardless what they write here's I remember predicted to get to 100s and it did.

"Doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations, assuming things progress as they have over the last number of years, I figure that Revlimid will likely generate in the neighborhood of $75B between 2019 and 2026 when Revlimid goes off-patent.  (I did factor in the fact that Natco can begin partial sales of Revlimid in 2022.). This result, however, is admittedly a very rough calculation and the actual number could be + or - $10B.  Net debt currently of maybe $3B.  Put this way, does it make CELG seem really undervalued at So, the question is: Would a company (maybe Merck) offer $75B ($107/shr) for CELG knowing that they would make that money back over the next 8 years from Revlimid alone?  What would the remaining revenue producing drugs and the pipeline be valued at?  Would CELG even entertain such an offer?  Thoughts anyone?Think I might buy a bit more tomorrow.",

He said that Model S had been sitting in his shop for months because it needed a hood that Tesla hadn't made a small production run for to replenish spares and couldn't give him an estimate when they would build more of the old model hood.

"chargedevs.com/...I am losing track of all the spurious claims being tossed out. Fast acceleration in a car is not the perfect vacuum of space. So stomping on the accelerator has to overcome all the internal and external resistance or friction at once. Pretty common sense. All those bits and pieces will be much happier if acceleration is gentile.  However with battery cars there is also the battery resistance. Which is true of charge and discharge. The battery is designed to parameters. Not the limitless vacuum of space. AS the system is pushed to the limit, efficiency drops way off due to internal resistance. Dissipated as heat. It is true of ICE systems as well. However, the computer has such control over engine trim, that power and torque are delivered in a very flat line today. chargedevs.com/...""The primary considerations which affect the rate at which a lithium-ion cell can be charged or discharged are its temperature and how fast lithium ions can move into or out of its anode by a process called intercalation""Another insidious effect which occurs as temperature declines is that the lithium ions that are supposed to be in solution to form the electrolyte will have a greater tendency to come out of solution and deposit onto the electrodes – a process called “plating out” in the argot. (Dead cell)The tendency for lithium to plate out is also more pronounced at higher charge/discharge rates,"" As I said when all this nonsense began, Tesla provides outside people almost no data.

"I am afraid advocates on this board are spreading misinformation thickly. Let me begin by saying, if Americans want to buy silly battery cars? Fine with me. But there should not be tax credits and HOV lane perks for technologies which are not cleaner. Just very expensive. ""Toyota's R&D department just made a bunch of special deliveries. The Japanese carmaker announced a host of incrementally improved powertrain components for the Toyota New Generation Architecture (TNGA) that Toyota says will reduce its global fleet CO2 emissions by at least 18 percent. The headliner is a new 2.0-liter, four-cylinder, Dynamic Force Engine (DFE) with a 40 percent thermal efficiency, making it the world's most thermally efficient engine with that displacement. Fitted to a hybrid system, TE gets bumped to 41 percent, matching that of the 1.8-liter hybrid unit in the current Prius, but with a higher performance ceiling thanks to the larger displacement.""www.autoblog.com/...A properly managed combined cycle natural gas plant can achieve heat efficiency close to 50%. But this is a base load technology. To be this efficient it must run within tight ideal burn parameters. However, California intermittent insanity forces the plants to ramp and cycle. So we are fortunate to achieve heat efficiencies of 30%.Battery cars have all the inefficiencies of driving a car. They are no more efficient except the giant thermodynamic loss of energy conversion is spent at the generation plant. The only reason battery cars might seem competitive on fuel cost? American fracturing has reduced the price of natural gas to $4mbtu. There are roughly 5.6mbtu to the energy in an barrel of oil. Natural gas is only discounted in America Everywhere else it is priced to oil BTUs. Only in America can be buy it at a 50% discount. But this large a discount can not last forever. Export trains are opening up. Also, intermittent windmills and solar panels are completely incompatible with battery cars. The charge must be done at night when there is grid capacity available. Wind is slack and the sun does not shine at night. Both are also grossly seasonal. It is one thing for a few thousand follisp progressives with more money than common sense to charge their cars whenever they wish. It is another if even 10% of the cars were battery. Imagine the insane flex your use mandate kicking in when you need a charge?The other reality is electricity prices are much higher in states over penetrated by intermittent. Yes, Texas as the best place for intermittent in the world is exceptional. But they will not be able to maintain their price only model much longer. The dispatch plant owners are shutting down their plants rather than waiting for market reform. Which is putting dangerous strain on the dispatch or true power reserve margin. Texas will have to reform their market. So that the critical standby dispatch reserve made necessary by intermittent, is paid for by intermittent. Otherwise the grid will follow the market into dysfunction. Which is what regular negative wholesale electricity prices prove.",
Rav4??? Gross.!,
"Why would anyone buy a Model 3 when this SUV hybrid is available? I would feel a lot safer, and I would enjoy the driving more being in a RAV4. I'll wait one year after this RAV4 comes out, then I would buy a used one for hopefully around $20,000. Why would you ever even buy a new car. I think it is stupid and waste of money. There are so many clean used cars that you can buy, specially lease returns. I bought my last car when it was two years old. It was a Mercedes lease return, and it was super clean. And since it was certified, I got additional two years extended warranty on top of the existing warranty. Never buy a brand new car. It's a waste of money.

"Your computations are blatantly biased. In this (trading) business you have to be nitpicky to survive. So, yes, a fair comparison matters...

In San Jose, CA (close to the TSLA epicenter) the min price is 3.09 $/gal, avg price is 3.63 $/gal (according to gas buddy web site). Using the average (3.63 $/gal) figure, RAV4 is now 38% higher, at 9.3 c/mi). Now we can also argue on price history of electricity and gas. WTI today is at 50.4 $/bl; the past 5 years it ranged from 26 to 108 8$ / bl; was above today's price 60% of the time... Price of the super charger ? I don't follow TSLA much, so I really don't know... does it follows utility pricing ? contracted pricing ?.. I will let the village comment on that one.Also worth noting, you are comparing an SUV with a sedan. These are two different beasts.

Below is the start of the article. It took 18 years to find this method and it does do what the title says.  Wanted to share it.   Hope of value to others. SummaryAuthor today bought a TSLA option spread that does everything in the title and more.A good case can be made this is totally superior to shorting the stock and to another stock option strategy that has been suggested.This trade makes a 35% profit in 5 weeks if the stock is unchanged, a 189% profit at $365 and a 14% profit if $315 or lower.Risk is only $425 with a 77% chance of a profit. Bottom line is you have to be very wrong to lose anything. Being a little bit wrong generates the highest profit.Sound too good to be true? Below you will see an Etrade option calculator for a real trade done 11-13-2018 on Tesla (TSLA) that verifies the above bullets.Where did this come from? About 18 years of searching for a good way to profit from crashes in popular high volatility stocks. It stumped me for a long time.",
"Dear Anton.I believe you are missing a key point. Hybrid is great but Tesla buyers are encouraging the industry to get serious and get off gasoline entirely. It's not just about money, it is about actual change.",
"This cost analysis is not very representative.  Many Californians can employ ""demand metering"" from their electric company where they are only paying $0.10-$0.11 per KWh to charge the vehicle at night.  This is about 1/3 the cost of the SUV using gasoline.Furthermore many Tesla owners in California will probably have solar panels making the fuel (electric) cost practically free.Another consideration is that a person will not buy a Tesla if they at only driving 12,000 miles per year.  (if that please buy a cheap used Nissan Leaf for $10,000).A Tesla  3 is appropriately purchased when the drive distance averages at least 100 miles a day (hey ! we have a 220 mile range!)Thus the average distance driving by the Tesla owner is probably more like 36,000 miles per year.In the above considerations, I did not mention all the time wasted in gas stations, maintenance,(oil changes, anti-freeze etc) that an ICE vehicles needs.The fuel cost difference is thus more like $2500 / year and worth about $30,000 in the price of the car.",
"Anton,Not a very well argued article in my estimation, since your main premises compare CA kWh at super charger stations to nation wide gas prices.""At 39 MPG and today’s nationwide fuel price of $2.61, that’s $67 to drive the U.S. monthly average of 1,000 miles.""""Guess what else is $67 per month? Driving a Tesla Model 3 while fueling it at the Tesla Supercharger ($0.26 per kWh in California).""First, you compare NATION wide gas prices to CA kWh electricity price for Super Charger stations. If you use nation wide gas prices, you need to use nation wide kWh prices too.California average gas rate is: $3.62 www.californiagasprices.com/... That's 38% more fuel cost than you calculated.Most people aren't going to use a supercharger fro commuting purposes, opting to plug in at their home for .16-.18 kWh. That's 30% less than you calculated.In fairness, you do state later: ""Not everyone charges their Tesla at the Supercharger most or all of the time, but some do - and as sales spread from those who live in houses to those who live in apartment buildings, perhaps an increasing percentage of Tesla buyers over time, especially as the Model 3 price point keeps falling to appeal more to less affluent individuals.""Perhaps, and by the same logic (time) when apartment dwellers can afford TESLAs, apartments will probably have chargers in their parking spaces to service all sorts of other EVs also, not just TESLA.",
I notice that you use California electrical costs but not California fuel prices when making  your comparison.  Isn't this like comparing apples to oranges?  Currently fuel prices where I live in California are $3.30 per gallon.  This kind of skews the results and the two vehicles do not have the same fuel cost per month.,
"The embarrassment factor of owning a Tesla is starting to take a toll.  Tesla is the least reliable car brand, the most expensive, the whitest owner base, the most try-hard poseur owner base, and on and on.Virtue signaling and status signaling are the only reasons anyone ever bought a Tesla.  But now with their securities fraudster CEO who denies medical care to injured employees, and cars that are clearly poorly built and a pain in the butt to operate and maintain, the status value of a Tesla is negative.I feel embarrassed for people who own Teslas, and increasingly THEY are feeling embarrassed too.  Not the full-blown Elon fanboys, they are hopelessly gullible.  But the normal people who once tried to be cool by buying a Tesla aren't feeling particularly cool anymore.",
"Another flawed analysis.  I'm a Tesla bear but lets at least do apples to apples comparisons.  You can charge a Tesla at home, my electricity cost 8 cents per KWH.  That makes it a pretty cheap option for transportation.  The toyota would also be cheap, but not as cheap.",
I live in CA   try comparing apples to apples. Gas here is $3.50 a gallon. 1 kwh is .16. Try that math on for size. Less than $12 to fill my model 3. 300 miles of range. 300 divided by 40 mpg is 7.5 times 3.50 per gallon = $24.50.,
"Dude, you can't compare ""nationwide gasoline average cost per gallon"" to ""California electricity cost per Kwh""Apples to oranges. Gas in CA is $3.50 if you're lucky.  Electricity nationwide is (I believe) less than $0.15 per Kwh.",
Isn't RAV4 Hybrid - which this whole article is based on - a cross-over??I'm looking at real Toyota SUV's for 2019 and the mileage is quite different.Sequoia and Land Cruiser -13mpg4 runner -17mpgHighlander - 21,
"AntonWow   good article 450 k comments equal to Tesla  m3 interests for the 35k car..You can read that many, many Tesla fanboys can't stand that competition is coming in any kind of vehicle, instead they should be happy with every ev.They want to kill the messenger...🤣",
"Bla bla bla bla bla!!!!!I have a toyota 4 runner with over 250,000 miles on it, No engine work ever or auto tranny work ever. Still gets 24 mpg on the road. 1999 model with 2 wheel drive and their 4 cylinder engine. Awesome car. Why would I want to pay 40,000 bucks for a rav4 to get a few more miles per gallon?? I am jazzed on electric for a number of reasons. Electric motors blow ICE motors out of the water and will last much longer. I am waiting for more competition and prices to drop when our beloved 4 runner finally dies (probably 5 to 8 years down the road)Hybrids are even more complex than ICE cars and guess what, they have batteries too.I thought about a plug in hybrid but as batteries get better and more affordable then they will become the next dinosaurs right behind the ICE.Tesla is showing the way and the big 3 are going to be in a world of hurt as they try to catch up.Gas prices may go up and down but the general trend is always up. We pay over $4 a gallon at our local gas station. You wanna go real green, do like me and ride your bike more! If things really turn to shit an e car with a home solar system and backup battery will keep you up and running.",

"IMO, from owning many Toyota's, I think Toyota is a better quality car for the $28K price than Tesla. What I do not like about Toyota is that today, their body designs are not attractive in my opinion. But since my last Toyota was a pickup that did not matter as much.",
"So I'll give real world cost of driving the Model S vs a BMW 3 wagon each over 50.000 miles . Model S .034 $/Mile, not factoring in cost free charging at superchargers and at free chargepoint/work/hotel/grocery stores. The BMW 0.15 $/mile. That does not include oil or any maintenance for the BMW. Tires were replaced at 42,000 miles on BMW and 38,00 on the Model S. I used 12 cents for electricity and $2.90/gallon of gas. Also consider the fun factor, as people who drive cars sometimes do consider when buying, to make a commute or travel bearable. Consider if you need space for transporting crap, i.e.,  needs for kids' sports, college, vacation trips. Factor in safety and other reasons people buy cars and then make a comparison. Tough not to consider a Tesla of any model, but to each his own.",
"Typical Anton Wahlman FUD:Manipulate facts to manufacture an incorrect conclusion.  He uses nationwide average fuel price but a maximum California supercharging rates.  As a consumer, try finding gasoline in California at the nationwide average fuel price.  Here in the Midwest I ould buy gasoline at about the national average, but I have been paying $.12/kwh when supercharging.  I have no special discount - that is the standard price.  I am getting 3.95 mile per KWH - city or highway, doesn't matter.  My cost per mile for energy is $.03 for combined driving.     My electric rate at home is a little higher.  If I switch to time of day metering, it will be considerably lower because I would schedule recharging during the off-peak hours, but there are other factors to consider so not sure if I will do that.As far as my home charging station, I could charge with 110 but that would be at a low rate per mile.  I put in a charging outlet when we were doing some other electrical work.  It  should last 50 years or more.Economics are a consideration for any vehicle purchase.  Another consideration is the driving experiece.  Suggest buyers take a quality test drive and talk with owners and then decide.",
Author should not compare California kWh rates to national average gas prices. CA has very high gas prices. Model 3 wins fuel cost per mile by a mile in CA.,
"In Germany they won't put up with shoddy car construction builds. Wait till the first Germans see how poorly the model 3 has been put together. I'm pretty sure that ""factory gated ""excuse wont fly in Germany. They demand quality like BMW and Mercedes offers.",
on certain models of Teslas there are structural issues with keeping the wheels from coming off the car.Bad suspension troubles have been reported over and over and over. is it just the model s and model x that have been affected? or have these kind of suspension problems also been seen on the model3.,
"The author is only off by a factor of two!  I own a Model 3.  I've had it for about  2 months and I've only used a Supercharger once (cost me $3.74).  Charging at home, which is typical for Tesla owners, costs me 3.3 cents per mile (293 Wh/mile, 80% charging efficiency, $0.09 / kWh).  That's $33 per 1000 miles and roughly half the cost of the RAV4's fuel cost.  I'm not putting down the RAV4, I think it's awesome that it gets such great mileage and I encourage people to buy it!  It's way cheaper to fuel than something like a base model Ford Explorer at $130 per 1000 miles.  Honestly, though, the RAV4 Hybrid is not directly competing with the Model 3.  It's a 219 hp SUV/crossover.  My AWD model 3 is a 346 hp sedan that also will never need an oil change, timing belt, exhaust system, spark plugs, valve adjustment, etc.",
kiss your cash goodbye when you loan it to Musk. as spacex and tesla have lost tons of money over the years.,
@Anton Wahlman   Why do you compare the  Rav-4 with the Model 3??!  We know from you as you have absolutely proved many times  that  the Bolt totally destroyed  the Model 3. Should not you have compared the Toyota with the real electric winner the Chevy Bolt?,
"I agree the price of fuel comparison is bogus,  but I still find 39 mpg for a toyota SUV  under $30K mighty impressive. some 2-car families might buy that as their ""road trip"" car and have an EV as their commuter car. Simply have have the person with the longer commute take the EV and have the person with the shorter commute take the Toyota. That will minimize fuel costs exclusive of road trips.On a road trip, I would be happy to pay a little more for fuel to have the convenience of 160,000 gas stations compared to 600 superchargers. So while I'm not so sure about the Model 3 comparison, I think for a lot of people, this car will compare well to the model Y.",

uses national average for gasoline but california price for electricity. way to twist things to make your article valid.... dont hand me oranges when I am trying to buy an apple,
"What an absurdly slanted article. Hmm, let's pick the most expensive electricity in the nation, and pit it against the cheapest gasoline.Average gas price in California is more like $3.40 to $3.80 or more. So that 39MPG SUV would have to get more like 60MPG. OR, compare that $2.60 gas to the national electricity average, which is 12c per kwh. So, now you'd need to get 80mpg.And this totally ignores that on the average national grid mix, the Tesla produces as much carbon as a 60mpg car - in California where most are sold, it's more like 135mpg.Also ignores the cost of oil changes and more regular brake jobs and coolant changes.Also ignore that many employers are now offering free solar charging at work.Also ignores that the RAV 4 has a 0-60 of 8.3 and the Model 3 has a 0-60 of 5.1. The two aren't remotely comparable, the 3 knocks it sideways on every metric.Be a journalist and have some ethics and make valid comparisons - there ARE cars out there that will beat EV's for emissions (if the EV is charged on a coal-only grid and you're OK with a 3-cylinder econobox that gets to 60... eventually...).But the RAV 4 Hybrid isn't one of them.",

Anyone asking any engineers to make a car half as sexy as a Toyota Rav4? Nope. No one cares. How many hybrid Rav4s crashed and burned this year? No one cares. Not everybody wants $75 back for every $100 they used to spend on gas to go the same distance, because they live in a freezing hell world and/or need all wheel drive. Sucks to be them.

Apparently consumer reports says the average automobile life expectancy is 8 years.

California gas averages 3.16-3.23 depending on where you live.

I paid $60 to have a 50 amp outlet installed in my garage, not $1,000 as you have speculated. The 7.7 kW Tesla mobile charger is included with the car at no additional cost. 3. You did not include other cost of ownership factors into your calculation, such as: oil/filter changes, more frequent brake replacements, spark plugs, all of the other fluids (transmission, brake, etc.) as well as upkeep/replacement of alternator, transmission, hoses, belts, radiator, engine, starter, etc. 4. I recently went on a 4,000+ mile road trip in my Model 3 and it cost me just over $200 in Supercharging, which is 5 cents/mi or $50 for $1,000...still cheaper than the Toyota SUV...and way more fun (instant torque at any speed), relaxing (autopilot drove me 100% of the way except to get on/off the highway), and safer (rated safest car ever tested by NHTSA).",

First of all it would be closer to fifty bucks to charge a Model 3 at 21 cents per kilowatt, secondly that is not the rate at every Supercharging site, prices vary from state to state, also,,,, WHO CARES! Most Tesla owners, and EV owners in general charge at home, where prices for electricity are less than ten cents per Kilowatt in some places. Of course, in ten years your gas burning SUV will be worth nothing on the used market as EV adoption takes hold, not to mention high mileage ICE cars inevitably need so much maintenance that they end up in the scrap yard because of repair costs, on the other hand EV drivetrains will probably last virtually forever,  and some cars such as the Model 3 have battery packs that could potentially last twenty years or more with the latest chemistry, and if the battery needs replacing by then, it will probably be at a fraction of todays costs, inflation adjusted.Anyway It's always fun to read Anton's outrageous claims, when you spin facts you can come up with almost anything,, except reality.",

This infuriates the dealerships who make most of their money on fixing your car after they sell it to you. An EV has approx 1/10 the number of mechanisms as an ICE car. An EV can get its electricity from your own personal solar array, or solar roof. And LAST BUT NOT LEAST. The benefit to humanity of EV's is priceless. Less pollution, yeah yeah ....even now, and as time wears on less every year as we move to sustainable energy. On the other hand, an ICE car is bound to fluctuating oil prices, continuing pollution and a major cause of DEATH to Humans. How about them apples Anton??",
This is stupid people don't super charge model 3 for daily driving they charge at home at low rates over night it's 0.09 here in Southern California even lower in other states. NOT 0.29.This article is all hatoraide.,
I have a RAV4 hybrid. I doubt if I average 39 miles to the gallon fprobably more like 35. And while it’s an all wheel drive car it is not made for off-road driving. Any pump or pot whole is really felt. the car it runs very Stiff . I assume it’s “all wheel drive“ due to the way the charging units work on the hybrid.,
"I think you need to add maintenance costs into this.  Strictly based on relative complexity of an internal combustion engine, transmission, cooling system (very complex) vs two electric motors , one would expect the maintenance costs to be significantly less with an EV.  So congrats to Toyota, but the contest isn't over yet",
"Funny article.  Author should double down his short position with the 2019 Rav 4 being the real Tesla killer.  My aversion to the hybrid  is the complexity of having dual drive trains.  We bought an Tesla M3 2 months ago and this was not a decision that can be justified financially.  I spent $30k more than I could have had a RAV4.  I could have invested that extra $30k and conservatively earned 5% on that $30k and I would submit to you that there would be no break-even point where the efficiency  of the Tesla would eventually catch up with the cheaper cost of entry of RAV4.  If I had to do it over again, I would buy the Tesla.  Bottom line, I wanted the Tesla and didn't want a Toyota RAV4.",

Honda already sells an all electric car. Tesla's uniqueness is waning.,
"Relatively few of my miles are going to be via SuperCharger.  Say 90% home, 10% supercharger miles for me.  Average cost of 0.10 per kWh between the two.  So my Model 3 will cost about $28 per month to charge assuming 1000 miles per month.  Compared to $67 for the Rav4.I've also signed up for a solar program with my electric utility.  I ""rent"" space on their solar farm.  Roughly 30% of my home energy is now coming from solar and I have no panels to install or maintain.",

"Er…Only two tweency weency flaws in your argument...First, the idea behind Tesla is you charge it at home, overnight getting a much lower cost per mile.Second, our other car is a Mitsubishi PHEV. That claims a huge MPG. Guess that they omitted to cover the cost of electricity in that. Do you think Toyota have fallen into the same delusion?  Hybrid cars are great but will be overtaken by EVs at some stage in the near future. In UK an ICE car costing £20K compares to a hybrid costing £30K and an EV costing £40K. The ICE and hybrid lower costs will erode as al EV manufacturers get their act together. This may take a couple of years.Oh, BTW, you're comparing an M3 with a car which won't be released until next year.",

I have just one word to describe Tesla 3! Convenience! Another would be POWER!,
I've been driving a Nissan Leaf for 5 years and I've charged it once outside my garage.  For the first three years I got free overnight charging. Now I pay 7 cents/Kwh. It's silly to compare commercial charging station rates to gas. It's an edge case use.  Every morning I wake to a charged car. Gas stations are just places to get mediocre coffee.  Wish I'd bought Tesla at $260.,
"I am sure many have pointed this out but NO ONE charges for daily use on a supercharger!  In SoCal, I pay 16 cents a Kwh, and pay about $42 a month for electricity.  No way this article is fair comparison for daily cost of driving.  The supercharger by my house is always full, so I wouldn't charge there and it isn't recommended to supercharge for more than the occasional trip.  Model 3 for the win....",
Climate change.,
"A hybrid has double the parts of a gas car and a tesla has 90% less moving parts than a gas car. Just brakes, tires and washer fluid are the maintenance items for a Tesla.",
Toyota makes great cars and they make great hybrids! In fact I own a hybrid Avalon that gets 39mpg. I like the highlander hybrid and the rav 4.  I just don’t want to support the oil companies any more. Next year I am buying an electric car.  Get used to it...there is a better alternative now.,
"Others have commented on the numerous flaws in this article (misleading comparisons, different audiences, ignoring maintenance costs, history of blatantly misleading attacks on a company he shorted) but the biggest is a glaring error for a so-called auto industry journalist to make.The RAV4 is not an SUV. It's a crossover. SUVs are built on a truck, not a car chassis.Can the editors of this site, if they actually exist, please stop giving this individual a platform?",
You are missing the big picture. Fuel cost is only one factor. But let's look at fuel cost. You choose California's ($0.26 per kWh rate). I live in Nevada and pay $0.06 per KWh. How would your thesis look using this metric?,
Anton is clearly trolling the Tesla shorts with this article. He is secretly a long buy-and-hold investor. I refuse to believe that someone can be genuinely this dumb.,
"National average electric rate is 12 cents. California is 15.2 cents. Unlike gas vehicles, Teslas mostly fill up at home at much lower rates. Cali gas prices are significantly higher than the national average prices compared.So in this comparison the actual energy cost for Model 3 is about half for California,  accounting for both higher gas prices and lower electric costs for home charging. The author really had to come up with skewed comparisons to make them seem equal. This doesn’t even account for the fact that even these false numbers are only possible because gas prices have dipped to an unusual low not expected to persist.",
"NO ONE will be cross shopping Tesla model 3 with a econo-suv no matter if it's Toyota or some other brand. Different cars, different expectations, different buyers. Tesla buyers are mostly looking for a newest tech features, while those who buy Rav4s want a cheap reliable transportation. Also - what's the point comparing avarage us gas prices with kwh cost in CA? Wouldn't it be fair to compare national average fuel cost vs national average kwh?",
What’s the difference in the price of cars? And how much more fuel can you purchase with that difference?,
so what your saying is Toyota has finally reached grid parity with electric vehicles? Wow!,
what??? 39mpg on an suv no matter where you drive??? My friend get yourself educate no sedan or any other vehicle except few small compacts can reach that mpg target without hybrification.The only car that's gonna make a ground breaking 30% (cough cough) highway miles improvement over the previous model will be the new guess what the 3 from Mazda implementing next engine technology without the help of any hybrid...Toyota will acquire this technology from Mazda now that they are working in partnership but that's not coming til at least next year....,
"As EV registrations increase----too many politicians will start hypying on the lost highway taxes. Why should the Musketeers not pay their share. When EV comparisons are made---remove all taxes per gallon---then be fair and add all the misc. utility bill charges included each month for distribution, maint etc.  to that hourly charge.",
"Who buys Tesla solely for the cost of fuel?! And who'll charge it at Supercharger all the time? It costs far below what you mentioned as the average cost to charge a Tesla.Average US electricity cost is less than $0.12 per KWh, not the $0.26 you used: www.eia.gov/...",

"Never agree with Anton but I would say there has never been any debate...nor will there ever be a debate over energy density between gasoline and pretty much any other energy product...but in particular batteries. Having said that and with more than few hundred thousand miles of driving under my belt fuel costs are in fact an ancillary cost to do business in the transportation sector in the USA. $rsla is crushing the entire Industry because of reliability, safety, durability and plain and simple practicality. one look at oil prices this past week shows the impact that this ""sum of all parts"" of the Tesla Platform has indeed had on the US Economy. A Tesla drives down and down DRAMATICALLY costs...but more importantly drives UP time on the highway.hard to measure the impact when combined with a ride sharing app like Lyft or Uber but obviously is GREAT news (over time/excluding valuation) for retail and distribution.""protectionism"" could become a problem for $tsla going forward...China hasn't in fact banned the vehicle from being sold nor has Europe. But if a $tsla semi truck goes into production next year and is cleared for safe travel by the Feds that's VERY bullish for $tsla. And of course as $tsla needs those trucks to move...drum roll please...Teslas...they need this truck too.So far very much an A-list for businesses that are willing to put a deposit down on a vehicle that does in fact exist. big sell off in Railroads today as even that Industry could be disrupted by the $tsla semi.long $tslastrong buy.",

"OK OK OK  let's argue about the pennies and whether it should be CA gas prices or NYC gas prices and whether it should be .8 or .18 / Kwh.  The point is that Toyota has a real live SUV that gets great gas mileage, is available now, has superb reliability, quality constructions, and service stations anywhere.  And costs about half the price (so argue whether that is before local taxes and regisration fees and the other pennies if you wish.)",
"Another missing (small) issue - Electric vehicles lose some charge while parked (e.g., 3 miles overnight), which makes them slightly more expensive.",
In Europe gasoline costs about 8-10 dollars per gallon as 70-80 % of gas price composes on taxes.I wonder when Anton will write on that!,
"The problem I have with you Anton, is that you are always 'bagging'  people who are thrilled with the BEV. The hybrid is a step in the right direction. That we can have them now is a positive. I would consider that your intellect is 'intact', so,  I have problems with your dogged determination to attribute foolishness to the crowd that support (for good reason) the establishment of 'the new way of doing things'.

The decision criteria are entirely different.",
@SA Editors why was this blatantly misleading article allowed to be published?,
Anton has become a Musk's brother he never wanted. Musk quotes Model 3 price as $34K after savings and Anton touts a $2.61 gallon of gasoline like it will stay like that forever. But the new RAV4 is amazing and obviously most people would prefer it over anything Tesla has now. I know I would.,
E-cars still have to benefit from taxpayer subsidies to make financial sense. Of course you will get the typical responses that claim Tesla is not really a car company and/or that they are the future because of their advanced autonomous driving tech or that compared to ICE cars they never need maintenance or break down. I wonder if Tesla will eventually qualify as a religious organization under 501(c)(3).,
"Again Anton comparing the specific with the general.  The same thing he's allowed to repeat over and over.CA electricity rates vs ""average"" gas prices.  Why is it so hard to compare CA electricity rates with CA gas prices???Or average electricity rates to average gas prices????Why is he even allowed to do the opposite?  Where is the editor in this process?  It's embarrassing.Apparently it's OK to waste more words on a disclaimer trying to explain the above discrepancy rather than writing an article with the proper comparison in the first place?Finally, the comparison is irrelevant anyway.  No one cross shops a Toyota SUV with an electric sports sedan.  If Anton has evidence to the contrary, it should have also been presented.",
But is the rav4 cool?,
"Omigod, when are you going to understand that there is a huge group of people who WANT TO BUY A TESLA because it's environmentally friendly, fast, beautiful, and high-tech cool? Maybe not among your friends in the auto industry, but in many places this is the car people want to buy.Nobody is sitting down with a calculator and trying to decide whether they will save a few dollars on fuel buying a Toyota or a Tesla. They are buying Teslas because they don't want another Toyota. (And it saves on fuel.)",
"This is either incredibly lazy analysis or willfully misleading. Setting aside the very silly assumption that 100% of charging occurs at superchargers (something that you ought to know is not true if you're doing your research on this stock you've shorted):Current average price per gallon in LA: $3.65 (higher, above $3.80, in the Bay Area). It takes you 10 seconds to research this (www.gasbuddy.com/...). There's no good reason why you couldn't have done this research, unless you found it inconvenient information. We'll ignore the fact that you get lower than rated MPG in high traffic cities, since traffic screws the fuel economy. At your 26 gallons a month, that's an incremental cost of ~$27/mo (again, higher in the bay area) vs what you're stated. On a five year period that's more than $1,600 dollars. The actual delta would be more along the lines of $3K if the majority of charging occurs at home or destination charging, as is the case for typical owners.Is the difference big enough to justify the incremental cost of an electric car? Of course not. But your analysis is still woefully wrong. And if you think the people that are buying, or considering buying, a Tesla are doing it primarily because of the fuel  savings, your understanding of the Tesla demographic is even worrisome, and I don't think you have a firm understanding of the dynamics that are going to affect this market over the next decade.",

Not even close Anton. Ben Sullins shot your comparison the last time you tried it. Look it up on YouTube.,
Long Tesla,
This article is false. They used the national average but the California kw rate. When I drive around a gallon of gas is 3.60 to 3.89 a gallon not 2.60.  Get your facts straight.,
...Tesla Model 3 consumes 26 kWh per 100 miles....Thats terrible efficeny. Most other BEVs consume about two thirds of that.,
"So Anton is taking the nationwide fuel price (much lower than California fuel prices) and comparing it to the Supercharger rate in California (higher than other states Supercharger rates and much higher than home charging rates).If Anton had modicum of integrity, he would use the nationwide average for electricity at $0.1313 and compare that to the nationwide average for gas pricing at $2.61.So in a fair comparison, over 1000 miles, the Toyota owner will spend $66.92 and the Model 3 owner will spend $34.14.Anton's headline should read: even at 39 MPG, the new Toyota SUV costs twice as much to drive as a Model 3.",
"Wahlman hits a new low in his series of ridiculous anti Tesla articles.  99% of the time people charge at home, over night, at reduced rates.

Stupid comparison that’s not even close to being true in Canada anyways. Free Tesla charging stations and .08c over night charging. My Neighbour estimated that his monthly charging cost less than $50.,

"I agree six-oh.  I personally like the price of AMZN now but certainly plan to ladder down on price if the markets continue their downward trajectory.  2019/2020 is looking more and more like a period of bear markets globally, but especially in the U.S.  Foreign markets have been going down for much longer, so they're likely ahead of us in the cycle that's just beginning here.That being the case, most companies period, will get hammered.  Even the good ones will get thrown out with the bath water in bear market.  The coming few years could once again make stocks look very attractive for long-term buyers.",
"Great company but perhaps still over-valued?  Also the sentiment of the overall market is turning bearish, and individually on AMZN as well.  I don't see the sentiment changing any time soon.  I do predict that AMZN goes lower from here (~1550 atm) because of negative sentiment.  I think that 2019 will be a sad year for stock markets world-wide.  Could be some good entry points for those same stocks though.  I see AMZN going as low as 1200 - 1250 in 2019.  It really depends on how much the revenue slows this coming year.  In the long-term AMZN will get back to 2000 and beyond, but it may take a couple of years.",

I shop a lot online and I almost always buy from Amazon because Amazon almost always has what I looking for and because I don't want to give my credit card out more than necessary. I think that that listing everything under the sun and identity security are Amazon's moats and I don't see anyone taking business away from them. So I'm long AMZN.P.S. I did buy something from online from Walmart once to picked up in the store. Walmart never notified me that the product arrived in the store. Five days after the product was supposed to arrive in the store I went to the store. It took them about 20 minutes to find the product. Apparently it had been sitting around in some hallway. Walmart isn't going to threaten Amazon's business.,
"I have a lot of respect for Amazon and Bezos but the author has understated the issues.  The reason this stock is down 20% is the revenue guidance was off by a third from what the market expected.  That was a huge miss for a growth company.  The story has always been growth and suddenly its fading fast.  Comparing earnings to Walmart makes no sense when Amazon has a PE of 75 versus 20 for Walmart.  AWS is the real deal.  In my opinion it is at least half the value and most of the profits.  Amazon has not proven yet it has a solidly profitable retail business.  That business still appears to be a loss leader for third party sales.  Meanwhile, Walmart, Wayfair, and most of the bricks and mortar crowd are finally getting serious about online.  Great company but showing some cracks along with the rest of the FAANGs.",

"Three potential upticks may occur in the coming weeks for AAPL and the stock market. 1. A major summit will occur between President Donald Trump and President Jiping Xi.  According to the South China Morning Post (https://sc.mp/bkvp0), China Hawk Peter Navarro has been pointedly left off the guest list of Trump aides attending the meeting.  Navarro is the chief architect of the U.S.-China trade war.  Last week Secretary of State Pompeo announced a cooperative agreement with China.  A cessation of hostility or an end to the escalating tariffs should boost the stock market and particularly AAPL.2. Apple has launched a web site devoted to refurbished Macs products (www.apple.com/...).  The site sells refurbished Apple products, including Macs, iPads, iPhones, Watches, iPods, HomePod, Apple TV, and accessories, just in time for Christmas.  Until recently, other retailers have been selling refurbished Apple products.  However, the refurbished market has become chaotic with lots of retailers advertising refurbished pricing to attract buyers.  By introducing this web site for refurbished products, Apple is reasserting control of pricing for refurbished products. Also, Apple would profit directly from refurbished product sales.  Apple is taking back this very important market segment.  3. A major cause of the AAPL decline has been stories that Apple is cutting back iPhone production.  However, increased sales of iPhone XR in China, during the massive 11/11 “Singles Day”  (appleinsider.com/...) have reversed several analysts’ estimate that China sales of iPhones will be low.  For example, a week ago, Rosenblatt Security had thought that iPhone XR sales would be lower than expected but XR sales exceeded total unit sales for both iPhone XS and XS max in China.  In the meantime, Apple has been very pro-active in boosting iPhone sales by cell service providers.  This include deals with providers to give free iPhone XR’s or iPhone 7 for $99.99 and only $4.15/month and cutting $100 from Watch 4 sale to add a watch line (appleinsider.com/...)In other words, Apple is competing fiercely for Black Friday and Christmas unit sales and revenues. Combined with a truce between the U.S. and China regarding trade and moving aggressively into the refurbished product sales, Apple is very likely to have a Q1’19 quarter that beats guidance and consensus.  Apple stock prices will come back with a roar.  This has been a turnaround for Apple.  Until recently, Apple was reluctant to enter the refurbished product market or allow service providers to lower prices too much, fearing this would undercut sales in their Apple stores and that other retailers will stop carrying and promoting Apple products. Apple has now officially entered the refurbished market and is setting the top end of that market.  This allows retailers such as Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Costco, to hold sales that undercut official refurbished prices set by the Apple in their refurbished product web site.  This will encourage rather than discourage them to promote Apple products.  Note also Apple’s new strategy of offering the most expensive premium products first (XS and XS max), which always attracts the most rabid Apple fans, followed by the second line products (XR) for more price-sensitive buyers, and then products (“senior” phones) for bargain hunters.  It is a very smart marketing approach that will show results this coming quarter.",

"Will ""Fear"" vs. ""Greed"" Decide Apple's Fate?This kind of 🐻ish tendency in something as rock solid as Apple, but whose cutting-edge, high-tech business model isn't confidently understood could create longer-term investor reluctance when a rebound should logically be occurring. We've seen this happen with other believed to be untouchable Mega-Cap, blue-chip companies, in the past. MMM, Cummins, Illinois Tool Works, Exxon, Kroger, AT&T, and more recently Home Depot, all carry the threat of becoming another GE! But since the business models of these companies are less than perfectly understood, by retail investors who flock to and away from them, the element of ""Fear"" easily 'outweighs' ""Greed"", in that vital neverending equation that governs ""Accumulation"" versus ""Distribution""; the stock markets version of 'Supply/Demand'. Lots of Uncertainty in the Air!Between the China/U.S. trade issues, that have been mishandled by both governments, combined with the increasing belief in an impending Recession, plus increasing Interest Rates, companies like Apple may find rallying to be harder to come by than the $1/4 trillion sell-off just in Apple over the last few weeks. When MMM, with an incredibly bouyant share valuation had an unprecedented rally less than a year ago, it came as quite a surprise when its share price fell from its rapid ascent to $257 in late January, prior to the State of the Union address, suggesting trade tensions with China, to a fast fall of over 22% afterwards, with prices volatile since and ~$200 10 months later. Will that happen to Apple? I don't know, but I did sell off our MMM shares and currently have $0 MMM for the 1st time in years.What's Next?Before we sold off MMM we sold Apple. Several years back for just under $140. It looked like a bad idea until very recently. So where's the security seeking 'DGI' seekers buying -- how about unusual high growth utilities, such as Next Era Energy or American Water Works. Somehow, when high-tech blue-chips tank, high Cagr secure utilities, mostly regulated tend to thrive. My dad's been steering me away from high-tech blue-chips and retailers and into Next Era Energy, American Water Works, and today AT&T.",

"The author's piece on AAPL and the comments therein leave me worried.  They are full of ""ifs"", most of which seem unlikely, while the few that are most likely IMO have no greater than a 50/50 chance.  I think AAPL has a following of loyalists akin to TSLA's.  The bad news keeps coming, with no end in sight, while the fanboys and pollyannas keep their smiley faces shining.  I think Apple is going to lose its entire China market, and Indians are notoriously frugal, unlikely to pay big bucks for the Apple cachet attached to a commoditized smartphone.  Plus, a key on my new MacBook Pro is malfunctioning.  Each day that I don't sell I lose significantly more money.  At this rate, it will be only another 20 days before Apple Inc. becomes worthless.  I think this began with the sudden decision not to report unit sales.  The market punishes uncertainty with a vengeance.  The ""geniuses"" at Apple should have known this basic fact, which doesn't give me much confidence in their other business decisions.",

Despite the share price rising many thousands of percent in Steve Jobs's time, he never once mentioned it, and appeared to have not the slightest care for it. It was a sign that he was intensely focused on the one thing that really mattered: the product. For Jobs, the product came first, and the profits followed. For Tim Cook, he 'follows the money' and the product comes second. In other words, the product is compromised in the interest of higher profit margin. I preferred Jobs's way.",

What about SE sitting at 10% before discontinued?""a simple move down the price ladder a little could mean tens of billions in extra revenues a year"" - NO. The success of the X price extravaganza clearly demonstrated that there is no elasticity. Unfortunately, that works both ways. A HUGE move down MAY mean tens of millions of unit sales mostly negated by the price drop. Or may NOT if done the 5c style.""If management wanted to disrupt the tablet market, what about an iPad mini that starts at $249 or perhaps even $199?"" - What about? Same as above.

"One thought about not reporting units anymore. Luca said that they would, for the first time, report the different margins on Hardware and Services in January 2019. So - what does that mean for ""Analysts""? I do think that this is going to create a jump in share price since the margins in the services area will be presumably much higher with less capital employed than the hardware business. Another positive is the much higher growth rate of services. This combined with the higher margins will have an impact on valuation multiples for sure. On the hardware side I do think they will over deliver (like most of the times) due to iPad Pro, MacBook Air and Apple Watch and those products will eliminate the eventual softer iPhone Sales (unit wise) effect by far. iPads and Apple Watches flying of the shelves everywhere and the the ASP for an watch is close to an iPhone 8. I added to my large share count last week (a little early) and wait for the shares to hit 250 US$ in not to distant future. The weak hands have sold by now I assume and I do hope TC feels a little bit responsible for all the guys buying at 220 and above. If I would be Luca, I would get another 50 Billion in loans and buy back shares as quick as possible. I am sure that they will declare another share repurchase program in January. Until then I feel that they buy back nearly 10% of the shares with the remaining 70 Billion of the programs. Imagine that. Nearly 10% in one quarter! Buffet also will load up so there might be a good chance that 10% to 15% of the shares get either off the market or will disappear in a long term depot.

I had to look up Versova Holdings, Prairie Star and Center Fresh, but they are the result of combining many of the old-time Midwest farms.Getting out is tougher, as second and third generations take over these family organizations, there is less and less passion for egg production. Let’s face it, egg production is a tough business, ask any one of these producers about the decade ended 2002. And who wants to buy a conventional egg producing facility today? Certainly not CALM. CALM trades at about 2.5 times book, but I doubt they would offer much more than book for any farm with conventional housing. The value, as mentioned in your article, for these producers is in their customer relationships and their ability to produce and sell value added products like Eggland Best and Cage-free eggs. This doesn’t mean that generic eggs have not been tremendously profitable over the last 15 years, because they have been. This profitability has a lot to do with the uncertainty about what the consumer wants. Low cost generics from battery cages, eggs from colony or enriched colony cages, or cage free eggs? It would have been a huge risk to build conventional housing after 2008 and the CA Prop that basically made battery cages illegal in California. Also, there was talk at the time of a nationwide regulation.Today, many groceries have pledged to transition to cage free egg sales by ~ 2025. The problem is most consumers still want the cheaper generics.So, my questions are:1)	How aggressive will HSUS and other animal rights organization get, if these cage free pledges are not met?2)	Will the hen population be reduced as conventional housing is converted to less efficient, lower bird number cage free housing?3)	Will per capita egg consumption reverse its tremendous rise if fewer and fewer low-price generics are offered at the stores?4)	When will Urner Barry begin to quote cage-free, and will cage free pricing then become more commoditized like generics currently are?In the short run hen numbers are very high at 326 million table layers, and are projected to further expand.  I believe this is due in part to brand new cage free facilities like CALM’s Rose Acre JV. The cage free push has reduced uncertainty, and I believe producers now know what to build, which may not be a good thing. However, eventually conventional housing may need to be destroyed or converted to cage free with fewer hens per house.  So, I don’t know if CALM is over or under valued at this time, but I believe CALM has a great chance to continue to expand their leadership role in the egg industry.",
"Daniel,  I think that one of CALM's major strengths is it's low debt.  According to TD Ameritrade, CALM's Total Debt to Total Capital ratio for the most recent quarter is just 0.49%.   CALM has a history of keeping debt low and CALM's dividend policy, although not attractive to most dividend investors, is fair and responsible with a clear intention of keeping the company financials strong. I don't think that we have access to the debt numbers for the 3 closest competitors that you quote in your article as I believe that they are all privately owned.  Is that correct? You said: ""Right now, the closest competitor Rose Acre Farms has only 67% of CALM’s laying hen capacity and the second (Hilllendale Farms) and third (Versova Holdings) closest competitor have each only about 40% of the laying hen capacity with most other competitors being behind even further."" As I read your article,  I recalled that CALM had recently worked with Rose Acre Farms in a joint venture.From CALM's 2016 annual report:  ""Our latest joint venture to produce cage-free eggs with Rose Acre Farms in Texas is onschedule to reach our full expected capacity in early calendar 2017.""This suggests to me that CALM's closest competitor is also CALMS partner.    They appeared to be working together to keep the business of producing Shell eggs viable. I don't expect to get rich from my investment in CALM,  but I do feel that it is a well run company.   I'm not sure that I can agree with your intrinsic value of $55.  I think that  the stock price is running a bit rich at $50 per share.   After all,  CALM has only been above $55 per share due to the run up because of the 2015 Avian Flu epidemic, and even Dolph sold off a few shares when those unsustainable highs were met.",
"Daniel, very thorough analysis and I appreciate your commentary. I recently covered CALM in a valuation course and want to share some thoughts. I agree with you analysis except for a few points. I think you underestimate the barriers to entry. CALM recognizes that there are around 55 major competitors and that number is down in recent years due to consolidation. I think the cyclicality of the industry and the commodity business “scares” off sizable new entrants. FDA, USDA, and the EPA regulate the industry which might also hinder some farms from growing/entering the market.In terms of pricing power I agree that regular eggs exhibit no pricing power. However, CALM has increased the percent of sales of specialty eggs as defined as organic, cage-free, brown, etc. These types of eggs do command a high sales price. CALM has made a commitment to grow this portion of their business and has +$40 million planned over the next year to transition current facilities to specialty egg facilities. The consumer trend for organic and locally sourced food supports this trend. I can up with an intrinsic value around $55. I agree that it’s still a good investment but not a true value deal currently.",Cal-Maine Foods: An Industry Analysis Case Study
"LMAOPC shareholders will recieve (according to your cipher) $682mm. Yah, they want out of that deal...Are you suggesting one of the largest private operator in the US had sights on something better, and just made a boo boo with MM? Opps, our bad, some dude on the internet can't figure out the deal, so the Board should be fired and the deal flushed. Do you even know who the share holders are for PC?Edit: wasdeafonce out, I remember why I left here....sigh, at least muckticat could give solid debate",
Cash is not a problem for this company.,
Let’s keep it simple. They have $75M. If they close the PC deal they will really start burning thru cash like nobody’s business. The best thing right now would be for PC shareholders to pull out and MM let’s them. Otherwise I dont see how this ends well.,

"MM I believe was running some specials....the negative thesis isn’t a traffic issue but rather their financial equilibrium. The elephant in the room is the lack of PC details. Imo, the red flag is its conspicuously absent even the “top” bulls here Cornerstone and Brochstein deflect the questions and are unable to articulate the financial details on a per store/asset basis and I doubt they will. It’s simple math.....they bought X stores that will generate X rev and profit each. The cultivation capacity is X with wholesale prices at X estimated rev and profit is X. Therefore based on rev/profits in 20XX of X the value of each is X. The remaining licenses are valued at X. The build out costs are X which will be in equity or debt. Don’t you wonder why it’s not been done? If you fill in these blanks it requires a lot of imagination to see the value here compared to others in the space. They paid too much for too little. They want to promote the idea that their the BIGGEST.....imo little man syndrome. 69 stores all across the nation which is beyond deceptive but it’s been said enough times people think it’s fact. This has been a cloak and mirrors stock. Only recently have ppl realized they didn’t just have 70M shares. They are focused on pumping the stock price and the most recent bought deal debacle is just the beginning imo of management bungling that started with the IPO. Sure they have nice store in prime locations no argument there. But it’s not like the APPLE Store where you make an appointment to buy your weed.",

"It would appear I have violated posting rules. I apologize, it was not directed to you personally, but a comment on your scrutiny of this ticker, and as such, the sector.",
Are you suggesting that if an opinion is published then it should go unchallenged? Is that what u prefer I’m not sure how that benefits you. All the things you mention have a nice ring to them but they have 14 stores that beyond the decor have not shown they have an investable business plan. So to expand the current business to 14 more stores and few dozen licenses I’ve not heard yet a numbers crunch that gets anywhere near the ROI. Actually have not heard one at all from the CFA here or other wizards. So far I hear it’s just “a good deal”. With that said compare Curaleaf which is richly valued btw to MM which is 50% more richly valued with much less revenue and management that resembles the Keystone Cops. So that begs two questions: 1. What are the revenues needed to generate a profit to justify the investment. 2. Is the current structure and management capable of executing to achieve those numbers. The lack of explanation would lead me to believe none of these guys has a clue in the world. If that’s true then it’s closer to the definition of pump and dump than analysis. Pump and dump requires no corroborating numbers.....it’s just “a good deal”.,
Crickets,
Correction: It was $46M of convertible notes that were shown as current liability on the balance sheet. They did lose $16M on $12M in revenue in 2017. Maybe Alan knows how many stores operational? But it appears this acquisition is a work in progress that after the $682M paid is going to require a significant amount of capital to convert to revenue generating operations. That means more dilution or high interest debt right Alan? Do you see them not accelerating the cash burn rate once this deal is completed? I still don’t hear any of the financial experts justifying $682M plus worth of potential future earnings in this deal.....maybe with $50B in revenue would be in the zip code? If that’s not the number what is your number?,
"So much misinformation and inability to find or read filings here. Folks, take some basic accounting!",
Now I understand why the lack of PC deal discussion.....they paid $682M for a company that rev run rate is $24M with asset valued st $70M much of that property which is good. It appears they sold for two reasons. 1. They were losing $6M year and they had $46M coming due in 2018. 2. They were offered 10X the assets and 30X sales.  I was shocked I thought they had at least $40M+ in revenues between the cultivation and 10 stores. Those numbers are hugely unimpressive. The price paid is beyond ridiculous. It will be decades before they see a positive return on the $682M.,
"So many hurt feelings..you have to at least look at the negatives, not just fixate on potential positives. They're blowing through cash reallly fast, 2 equity raises back to back (that's not normal, even in the cannabis space) and the CFO just quit..this stuff is relevant. Maybe everything will go fine for them. But you have to look at the bad AND the good and not just get bent when someone questions their strategy. Good article Cornerstone, as usual.",

Now, ignore the noise and hold until the CBD infused drinks go on sale then you will be rewarded very big time.",
I think there’s opportunity in the retail space more so than wholesale. MM has no moat and it’s gotten more crowded in the last 30 days and will continue. I don’t think MM is the winner here it’s going to be another company with a better share structure and financial structure it’s not that complicated at the end of the day it’s a commodity that only sell floor so much and having massive overhead is not a winning formula. 90% of the US market is looking for price because the quality is already there even in the black market.,
Two years from today MedMen will trade at $15 dollars per share or more. Then all of these nervous packed posts will sound very childish. This is a young market and the U.S. will get there. Be patience and stop worrying about doubling your money in 6 months. We will all get there and MedMen will be profitable.,
Once medmen gets that billion dollar deal for expansion I'm sure everyone will be happy including share holders.  They are the largest after all and how much did constallation pay and at what share price for CGC? US market alone tops Canada by over 10x.  Lots of billion dollar companies and industries this could come from.,

That ended in their cousin Elon Musk buying them out and bailing them out and now I have heard Solar City is in even more trouble these days.  And Real Goods Solar.  They bought up a company in Hawaii and that failed to pan out and now the whole solar industry is in trouble.  You can tell me its apples and oranges but I see parallels and I dont care if Medmen is the biggest US cannabis company by market cap... the taller they are the harder they can still fall.  I wouldnt touch this company at this time.  And who even knows if these guys know what they are doing.  Just my humble opinion.",
"I will add that there may be a third possibility, although less likely I must admit.  That is that certain investors wanted to add MMEN shares PRIOR to the coming financials.  And this line of speculative story would suggests a scenario where the coming results are good or very good.  These things don't happen in a vacuum - Cannacord talks to significant investors who talk to MMEN management who talk to Cannacord, and on and on.  So maybe there was a direct demand side to this story.As for the CFO resignation, someone has to fall on the sword for this...",

And these are the main cost factor.Tesla will supply an adapter for S and X. Therefore, the following prediction: The charging stations, the VW has to build as part of its agreements with US authorities because of the diesel scandal in the United States will initially serve more Tesla than VW. And with the arrival of the first competing products, more and more people will abandon their reservations about e-cars. And with 1 percent market share of electric cars, Tesla still has a lot of growth opportunities.",

"Interestingly there is some interesting ""Competition"" coming.  This is the first effort that I take pretty seriously outside of Tesla and Jaguar--Rivian.They look to be deadly serious about building a pickup and SUVs and doing it right.  I'm betting Elon Musk will welcome them to the fray.Now, the oily folk and big auto crowd needs to split their attention and FUD to another serious player as these folk seem well financed and are going with the same model of buying an abandoned plant for pennies on the dollar and starting production.   And they are gunning for the heart of the profitability of big Auto (especially Ford)--pickups.  Their vehicle looks pretty impressive so far.“I think we’re going to be showing something pretty special, in terms of its vehicle package,” Vinnels said. Rivian claims the vehicle will have upwards of 400 miles of range, speed to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds, and wade through 3.5ft of water.www.teslarati.com/...",
"Fans have waited a LOOOONG time for the 35KM3.  My guess is that the first ones will be delivered on July 1 2019 (rebate drops to $1750) in order to maximize sale of higher priced vehicles.   If people were going to drop off the list (the 360,000 strong list) they will have done it by December knowing they weren't getting max rebate.  I would also HIGHLY suspect an announcement date of just WHEN 35K is coming to market BEFORE the Model Y unveil or there may be a severe backlash of people NOT putting reservations down on the Y.  Finally battery production is the key.  I'd love to get on that 4Q conf call and ask what the state of battery production is expected to be in 2019....and if Elon sees the M3 holding the #1 car sold in america spot gained in Dec.  Get ready to hear that OVER and OVER and OVER again in 2019...and when you are sick of it we'll say it again. I warned shorts in Sept. Musk holds the levers of power, he hates shorts, and he can manipulate deliveries the way he wants.  I see a Dec 2018 where he concentrates EVERYTHING on US sales while the delivery squeeze from weeks down to 7 days will also boost sales numbers.   Trying desperately to get 7000 M3 production flow is a BIG hint.  Landing that badge of US #1 car sold will also keep the carrot looking fresh in front of the reservation cart.   Hey everyone, who knows when the next major ICE unveil is?  Yet everyone is anticipating Y news, 35kM3 news, Truck, Roadster, Semi......who needs advertising.",

Tesla is idling along, spinning their Model 3 ramp, but what comes next? They’re out of space for production. China is just a pipe dream at this point, it’s just vapor. Semi, Roadster2, Pickup, Model Y, all just vapor. Vapor that requires massive, massive CapEx and time to bring to life. We’ll find out what the ongoing demand for the 3 will be in the US about abroad but it won’t be 500k/year, which they’re unable to build anyway.

Now I realize, like some other former bears, that setting very lofty goals, and missing them, is not complete failure.  Coming close means that Tesla survives, and produces hundreds of thousands of expensive innovative autos that are admired by the market.

When you add up what he owes the vendors and creditors there isn't enough cash on hand or payables coming due to cover the total that is needed just to get to near broke.  And as credits fade away and competitors have to offer EVs at a low price just to stay in business, Tesla's margins are going to implode.  The way I see it, at best Tesla is worth at least $50 billion less than the current market cap.  And no matter what happens in the short term, the risks are too high to justify holding it.  At this point, I would get rid of the Tesla shares and look for safety.

"I think the reorganization Culp just announced is the first step in changing the view that you have pointed out. Putting the gas turbine business under the leadership of an individual who understands the business potential of maintaining and upgrading a large fielded base is the first positive step i’ve seen in turning around this business. If the company didn’t believe in the future of the business, why spend 13B acquiring Alstom. If you look at the recent organizational announcement, most of the acquired assets are in the all other business entity, still under Stokes, who after all, has no history in the turbine world and is a finance man. I believe he was floundering trying to deal with the Alstom poison pill while dealing with a demand downturn in Gas turbines. I wouldn’t be surprised if Culp sold the all other component. I guess you missed the 240+M contract power just booked to use their leading edge process to convert exhaust, toxic sulphuric gas into an inert substance on four India coal plants. Gas turbines will be an on-going market, possibly at less volume, but care and feeding of the installed base will be substantial. Possibly the lack of conviction you signaled out came from the renewables side of the company to justify continued investment in windmills. Now there is a business whose revenue is growing while its margins decrease. Taken to the limit growth will continue until profit is zero.",

If anyone believes that most of the population of the world is going to trade coal, oil and gas generated electricity for solar panels, windmills and other renewable forms of energy generation in the foreseeable future they are not very realistic. My prime example is Holland. No other country is characterized by windmills, I believe, more than this country. Yet approximately 60% of their electricity is generated with fossil fuels. I do believe coal and eventually oil will be used less, but gas powered generators have a long future ahead. Solar and wind without subsidies are still significantly more expensive per kilowatt hour. Someone asked a very pertinent question recently. How many plants that manufacture solar panels have their plants powered by electricity provided by solar panels? Good question!",

The divisions do better apart.I don't think the obligations of GE Capital make it impossible to decouple the businesses.

If the overall value of GE Capital is negative, than just take the loss and recognize it and sell the commerical paper (insurance obligations or the like) and just divide it amongst the divisions or saddle it onto the healthiest ones as a debt.  But definitely unwind the paper and just get rid of the strange securitization games and the like.  (Funny how GE and Enron love mark to market EXCEPT when it shows negative results.  But just sell the paper (non operating obligations) and some of them you will need to pay people to take. Big deal.  Do it.  This is not so strange.

The series of absolutely incompetent decisions made by Immelt and the board since 2015 will probably go down as a future Harvard business case as among the worse in corporate history. The idea that one could dispose of long time legacy businesses, with great name recognition and large fielded bases that were profitable, and replace them with acquired companies that were more complex, declining businesses and different cultures, is almost ludicrous on its face. Further, the myth that renewable wind and solar energy is economically competitive with gas generated electricity shouldn’t be taken seriously. The windmill business GE has keeps growing revenue while margins decline. How anyone thinks this business will be instrumental in helping GE turnaround is truly a mystery.

"Corporate debt is $69 billion and net debt is $54 billion, not $101 billion.  The rest is at GE Capital used to finance loans and leases on aircraft engines, turbines and diagnostic machines. Those loans can be sold at anytime paying off the GE Capital loans as the customer base is very strong. In fact they are already doing that, selling some of their health equipment loans.I agree GE is better off splitting up.  A 20% IPO of Healthcare would raise at least $10 billion if they need it.The Power segment is much of what has dragged them down.  However, about half of what is left is service and maintenance revenues.  That is a very recurring profitable business.  Also, competitors Siemens and Mitsubishi while seeing declines, are not declining anywhere as much as GE.  Some of the problems are GE specific and fixable.  I believe this business will be right sized into a profitable albeit smaller one than before.  The biggest challenge is right sizing in France, though that government is more business friendly right now.Keep in mind, GE's bonds are still investment grade.  Its pension will also benefit from higher interest rates which improves investment returns and raises the discount rate which lowers the obligation amount.  Cash is already coming in from several asset sales.  Also, GE's two most valuable segments, representing about 72% of market value, in my opinion, are recession resistent.  Aviation their most valuable segment has a locked in backlog going out well past any recession.  Healthcare also tends to be less cyclical than most.",

"According to Wikipedia:The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a United States ""federally chartered corporation""[jargon] created by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).   In fiscal year 2015, PBGC paid $5.6 billion in benefits to participants of failed single-employer pension plans. That year, 69 single-employer pension plans failed. PBGC paid $103 million in financial assistance to 57 multiemployer pension plans. The agency's deficit increased to $76 billion. It has a total of $164 billion in obligations and $88 billion in assets.So in other words, the PBGC is a federal program which is itself, insolvent. This in turn means that any funds that flow out of the program, to GE pensioner's for example, are taxpayer funds.Translation:GE could get a federal bailout for totaling jacking up the business, robbing Peter (creditors and pensioners) to pay Paul (management and stockholders).When people fail financially, whether by misfortune or by poor decision making, they suffer deeply. People not paying their debts results in a social stigma that stays with them for years, if not forever. People who fail are hounded by collection agencies, lose jobs, families, even lives but for the lack of capital, opportunities, and access to financial advice that GE has always had.Less than 10 years ago GM filed bankruptcy. To shed its obligations it simply shed it's bad skin and grew a new one; kind of like a snake. Today, S&P ranks GM's long term credit worthiness BBB+ and its short term rating A-2. These are not the best ratings possible, but GM in reality, all they mean is that GM pays a little more for its debt for the time being.If Corporations want to enjoy the benefits of ""people status"" - religious rights, free speech, etc. - the playing field should be leveled.  Corporations need to bleed like people too and stop sucking off the public teet.

"Bah Humbug. The pension liability is somewhat of a red herring. First, there is, I believe, some 72B in this fund. The shortfall is computed by taking the estimated present worth  of the future obligation amount. The estimated reduction of this shortfall with every quarter point increase in the federal funds rate is 2.5 B or so. This arises from simply changing the assumed interest rate earned by existing pension funds that reduces the present worth amount in the shortfall. Five quarter point raises by the fed would ipso facto reduce this liability by 12.5 B. Whether this paper computation will be realized is a question to be analyzed, but the pension liability has been too big a bogeyman that has been somewhat disingenuously highlighted. By far the bigger part of the debt is in GE capital. I, for one, would like to see the profile of that debt and what part of it is against secured assets, when borrowed money must be repaid, etc.. one thing we know is that GE capital traditionally borrowed money to turn around and lend it to customers at a profit, generally loaning it to them on secured assets, I would like to understand how much of that debt, for example, is involved in the ownership of the large jet fleet that they lease to customers at a profit. Just referring to the big debt without any analysis is relatively superficial.and certainly feeds the negative frenzy of the so called financial analyst community,",

"GE's pension obligations are very manageable.  .however, if any company with a large pension recipient population could expect that that in the case of a BK, those pensions would likely be restructured.. as was the case of the Detroit City Pension fund( grossly mishandled by the City of Detroit administrators) GE will be able to handle the debt restructuring and make the nominal pension payments..but it could reserve the right to reduce the individual payout to certain groups of pensions, eg. those whose pensions are over $ 100k annually..or even reduce all pension payouts by 10-15% if needed..remember, a BK would hurt pensioners a great deal because all their stock would become worthless...GE's pain will be shared short term but I think will recover nicely, long term.. along with the stock...the quickest medicine for GE is the resolution of the Power/Alstom situation and the raise of capital from GE Healthcare spin off and the wABCo spin off..",

My question is whether GE is receiving the dividend flow from the LTCare policies or did they spin that out with Genworth and just kept the liabilities?2.

"Let's look at the numbers:1. As of Dec. 31, 2017, GE reported a pension shortfall of $28.7B (using a discount rate of 3.64% to calculate their pension plan obligation).Rising interest rates decrease the obligation by increasing the discount rate. In the 2017 report GE stated that a .25% discount rate increase would reduce the obligation by $2.4B. Interest rates have risen by approximately 80 basis points (.80) this year. If the GE discount rate (to be released in early 2019) reflects this, it will reduce GE's pension obligation by $7 to $8B. If rates rise in 2019 (as Powell has indicated he will) the obligation will fall even further.2. GE said in 2017 they would contribute an additional $6B toward the obligation in 2018. If they did so, the obligation will be reduced by an additional $6B.3. If GE follows through with the healthcare spinoff, up to 54,000 employees (along with $18B in debt and pension obligations) will leave GE. My best estimate is that this would reduce the pension obligation by about $4B.So, we start with a $28.7B obligation, subtract $7B + $6B + $4B = $28.7B-$17B = $11.7B remaining pension obligation.We won't know for sure until we see the 2019 numbers but the pension obligation may be quite manageable. We have to see if GE follows/followed through on what they say/said they were going to do.",

"This author does not understand what a finance company is.  This was explained to him previously and he ignored or failed to understand.  Total corporate debt is $69 billion not $115 billion.  The rest is at GE Capital used to finance loans and leases on aircraft engines, turbines and diagnostic machines.  Those loans can be sold at anytime paying off the GE Capital loans as the customer base is very strong.  In fact they are already doing that, selling some of their health equipment loans.Regarding the pension, the author provides no support for his claim the PBGC will force a higher contribution.  In fact he has none.  First of all GE’s pension is at about a normal level of underfunding as a percentage of obligations to similar companies.  There are many with a much higher percentage underfunding, look at Illinois for example.  Secondly, GE is putting in over $2 billion a year already and is complying with Federal pension funding requirements.  Thirdly, interest rates are going up.  That helps pensions in two ways; higher return on investments and a higher discount rate which lowers the obligation calculation.  Fourthly, no new pensions have been granted in ten years, it is winding down.Stop making stuff up.",

"1 Citibank is buying back shares at a far higher rate than JPM therefore the payout ratio is lower. For many investors this is more tax efficient.2) Citibank has far higher employee turnover than JPM and given that banks are essentially composed of two things. A) A very large group of high cost/high value knowledge workers turnover is very, very costly.     - The second primary component of a bank is it's information systems. Jamie Dimon radically increased JPMs focus on on IT systems when he came aboard JPM about 15 years ago.  The bank had been doing little realize the advantage of scale and had many disparate systems from so many years acquisitions.  And despite the already high IT spend - little of the information that its systems provided was useful, timely, integrated into operations, or easy to access.   He put an enormous focus on improving the management and use of information and began to spend billions on information management and brought a large part of the IT function back in-house.. He made IT a central role in JPM's operations and didn't confine it to the IT department and pushed for  the operating areas of the bank to incorporate IT as a key component of their operations.  The reason for the shift is that for a bank, -especially for a large bank to realize the advantages of scale, IT is a critical core competency (just as much as marketing or sales & trading) that impacts the performance of all a banks operations. What does a bank do? Essentially it receives, intensively analyzes, and exchanges mammoth volumes of information and a nearly a commensurate volume of electronic currency at extremely high velocity.   I would wager that we are now witnessing big returns on decades of IT investing.  As an example: I know from insiders that in 2003, JPM struggled mightily to determine which clients, products, services, and trades were profitable - especially on a risk-adjusted basis  That has changed dramatically and boosted the returns across the board and enabled far greater scale efficiencies and while managing risk.  I understand that Citibank is not as far along as JPM in this area and the difference is notable. That said, perhaps Citi has more upside but JPM has the trophy assets and probably a better pool of talent.",

"The article starts off with mention of 4 quadrants for Apple from years ago. What strikes me is they are all PCs. Today Apple has other segments: phone, tablet, pc, services and other products.In each of these segments they dominate. They dominate the premium segments of phones, tablets, PCs, watches and mobile audio. Also their services segment is large and growing.The author mentions gaming that Apple needs to work on. iOS is already an important gaming platform. As the author notes Apple has invested in features to prioritize gaming. One issue I have with the proposal is it focuses on inputs Apple purposely deprecates for iOS, namely things like mice and keyboard and controllers. These peripherals are not natural to iOS so why would Apple all of a sudden prioritize features that are not part of the architecture? In short if you want a pc to play games buy a pc, don’t get iOS.Personal server. I get that there may be particular scenarios that Apple does not serve well. All companies have strengths and weaknesses. Without being able to think of this proposal too much it seems that the author is proposing ripping up the infrastructure that underlies iOS to replace it with something new. Fundamentally Apple relies on their authentication to the cloud to offer services. Namely authenticating your device and appleid with the assets and data you have. This happens seamlessly to you and your devices where you can share data between your devices in a natural way. The author proposes to create a new paradigm that somehow embraces the authentication element with a local hardware solution Apple does not control which of course leaves you open to having your data hacked because you are introducing an unknown element into the stack. As an aside corporations are going the other way by trying to lock down who and what accesses their systems.Corporate servers - this proposal I believe is DOA. Apple has never served the corporate market. This is the domain of Microsoft and others. Apple does not play in this pond, ever. From a corporate culture perspective Apple only serves the consumer market and completely ignores the corporate market. To the extent it pays lip service to the corporation, they have a hands off relationship where they have contracted with a few systems integrators to deal with the myriad issues corporations present.Apple cloud. I am confused as to what is proposed here. There are many players in the cloud market. We have 3 big players, amazon, Microsoft and google. Each brings different approaches to the cloud and offer different services. The short description of Apple cloud here is confusing to me. It appears centered on swift and libraries for swift which technically is not cloud but a programming offering.Code marketplace. This actually sounds more like a cloud services offering. Maybe even a serverless computing model. This portion of the article states Apple is desperate to break into the enterprise space which I disagree with. Apple actually wants nothing to do with the enterprise because catering to the enterprise means they have to pivot away from the consumer which is their bread and butter and always has been.",

"Thanks for this thought provoking piece. The take away for me is Apple has plenty of opportunities and the funds to execute (and fail if needed). For me what sets Apple apart is that is indeed the only tech 'luxury' brand, right or wrong it continues to command a premium and in doing so has massive financial resources at its disposal. I do think they need to stay focused and agree with a previous comment that there is plenty of opportunity to bring an extraordinary UX with AR and in doing so pushing the technology even further to the background. In terms of monetizing that I could see people pay for a turnkey apple service where I no longer pay for an iPhone or an iPad. Rather I pay for a package which delivers multiple services through end points (devices). Users don't and shouldn't care what is 'under the hood', and from what I've seen most ios users appreciate that they don't have to.",

"@Zynath Investment.  Thanks for some very thoughtful suggestions.  You make two statements at the beginning.  The first is “renewed fear of ‘Peak Phone’... not a fear without substance”.    The second is “there is just a little magic in the post Jobs Apple.”  These two statements (or similar ones) are being repeated like a Buddhist mantra in many articles and comments on Seeking Alpha, without much objective evidence.  Apple still has head room for growth of iPhone sales.  In the U.S., despite being the only American company that is selling more than 5% of smartphones, it currently has only 34% of the market in the U.S. www.statista.com/... about 15% of the worldwide market (www.statista.com/...).  They still have 66% headroom to grow in the U.S. and 85% to grow around the world before hitting the ceiling, assuming that the market size does not grow.  Apple can gain market share if they reduce the prices.Steve Job’s “magic” did not work on as many people as Tim Cook’s magic.  In 2008, when Steve was in charge, probably less than 100 million people around the world used Apple products.  In 2018, 1.4 billion people are using Apple products.  The main advantage of Android phones was lower price.  The average sales price of Apple iPhones was nearly twice that of Android phones.  Apple has a choice.  They can sell fewer iPhones for more money or more iPhones for less money.  They chose the former and became the most profitable company in the world.  The five ideas that you proposed are all exciting but I think that you have to admit that the some of the ideas (gaming, personal and corporate servers) are not novel and some ideas (programmable cloud servers and code marketplace) already have very strong competitors (Microsoft, Google, Amazon).  More important, none are likely to earn enough to move the needle in the near future for a company making $250 billion revenues a year.  Apple has been moving on at least three of these ideas:  gaming, personal servers, and corporate/government servers.  For one, Apple now has the best mobile gaming computers on the market.  With the iPad Pros beating all but 10% of laptops in speed and image rendering and iMac Pro with an external GPU that can beat all desktop computers, Apple has the hardware power to blow all other gaming computers off the map.  The introduction of Mac Mini that can be stacked to provide parallel super computer performance, Apple is providing the safest (secure enclave encryption) computer storage and speed for the most demanding corporate/scientific/military computing, using available Intel based software.       I am very glad that you pointed out the collaboration of Apple and Google in implementing Swift/Tensorflow programming.  Apple poured substantial resources into building the Swift language and recruiting millions of young people to coding.  This is an investment into the future and will be very powerful when it comes to fruition.  Finally, it is true that there is a lot of money in code development, something that is probably single-handedly supporting 30% of the economy of India.  This could be better organized and monetized.  Ideas are cheap, implementation is hard.  I do hope that Apple continues to pursue these five ideas.  They are no-brainers.",
"Good idea for an article, not so sure on the execution. Pays little attention to the current competition and the need for differentiation (and why customers would switch).The size of these markets is also not mentioned, which is a basic requirement for any market opportunity. After all, the size alone might / might not present Apple with a realistic opportunity to materially grow their gargantuan revenue base. An on the topic of a new “gaming console”, this is probably already old news! The future is steaming. No need for devices in the future. And on that note, the current Apple TV device has a shelf life. Now... if they could evolve the IPhone itself into a TV Streaming hub, with smart mirroring, then that changes things somewhat... and one would imagine they are probably working on that amongst other more realistic mass market opportunities such as health devices/wearables, and AR glasses",

"Interesting article so thanks for taking the time.  Your ideas, while in some cases you admit are a bit of a stretch.  I think you are WAY overestimating Apple as a software company.  Hardware is their forte, and they have cornered themselves into being a high margin and an (alleged) luxury brand.Servers are moving from on prem to the cloud, in droves, just see MSFT's ER.   A Home or small business server has been tried, and failed, and by a company that actually builds the server platform that runs Azure (Windows Server).  Small businesses also have many cloud options today to accomplish what they need whether it be Office, CRM, IaaS or any other workload, the options are there, and with multiple players to choose from.Gaming isn't just somehting you 'get into', you need to have the right vision, culture and capabilities to remotely be succesful.  It took Microsoft over 10 years before the XBOX platform was profitable, and even now, that is beginning to shift away from consoles, or local hardware in general, to being cloud based and ubiquitous accross platforms.The code marketplace is interesting, and may have some legs, but the challenge is that Apple has no track record of being community, or customer, friendly.  The app store is their 'code marketplace' at the moment, and they demand a 30% cut of the action.  To compete with the likes of GitHub, that simply won't fly.  The developer community is bright and vibrant and is very much moving away from proprietary languages and models, which is where Apple has ALWAYS played, they want you locked into their hardware, cloud and services.Anyway, thanks again for the article, something new and interesting to noodle on instead of the falling share price!",

This is a large market that is growing fast right now.My vision is blurry and my hopes modest, but I have a plan:1) build a blade: fancy is it not?a) not an 18 in monster, just big enough to fit into a Mini.b) not Intel, rather what I would call the A12D (for desktop).  This CPU has a six core CPU, all high end with a heat sink and power management, capable of 64 GB of ram, a M2 slots and a PCIe32 bus.  It must have an AI engine but a very small GPU.c) this becomes the base of all the rest. of course there would also be a dual Processor version. With the second CPU not having all of the extras, no GPU, no Secure Enclave, no real peripheral interfaces.2) build the home server: six TB of rotating storage, 1 TB Flash, room for one bladea) price $250 plus a fee structure for services say i) $5/month for 1 TB of storageii) $4/month for Hulu/Netfix/Apple/local programming advanced download or order delivered on a timed bases.  The corporations will kick in to make this happen.iii) 1 TB of storage, VPN, (DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem, DSL equiped, or Switch), basic router, Print services, local AVP share with authorized devices.3) the home server plus: same as above with Wi-Fi and a second blade port.\4) the small business server: same as above with four drives and four blade slots to host a virtual container (cloud) infrastructure.  These come from the Business App Store.5) the rack-em stack-em big boy blade server. This allows for 8/12/24 blades and 8/12/24 HDDs no Wi-Fi. and a lot of containers.All of the above systems use the same Mini blade.All of them provide a path to getting Apple software written for the A12/A13/A14.

No longer can folks with student loan debt be able to afford the basic necessities of living having a huge student loan debt hanging over their heads for life.",
The first two options only encourage the customer gain more weight and become more physically unhealthy.   Maybe they need to come up with a different app to get people off of the sofa and moving more and making it a fun game at the same time.  CDC says we are on track for 50% of Americans to be obese by 2030 and the  next 30% cohort will be near obese.   That will only leave 20% of the population in healthy mode.  One wonders what would happen if the military suddenly needed people.  It is already a crisis now so it is hard to imagine creating apps to make it even worse.,

"Apple makes the Mac Mini but they intentionally kept it from being able to use w/a TV screen. They even offered a server version perfect for small business and home use. But they intentionally crippled it, likely so it would not hurt desktop & notebook sales. A wasted opportunity just like not letting a cellular iPad be a phone where you use your Apple headphones to answer or make a call.As big an industry as Corporate Cloud is the medical end their current products could command market share. Licensing wouldn’t be a problem if they bought some companies already licensed. Why can’t Apple head phones, working with your phone be hearing aids? Tim is awesome at whet he does, but he clearly doesn’t get in his own Apple projects like Steve did in order to get products consumer ready. Apple also badly needs much better marketing experts out in the field to judge what the public wants so he can address the issues in meaningful ways. ie:The pre WWII headphone just won’t handle bandwidth nor HZ! But the public doesn’t know what music really sounds like & Bluetooth is a step backwards, however convenient.",

"Interesting points, but some of these things are clearly never going to be done by Apple in a million years. As in never.Apple has a lot of potential, but they’re never going to “dominate the gaming market.” No one would trust them to not screw it up. Even I, a huge fanboi (and investor), would not even buy another Mac Pro (whatever they come out with in 2019), because I’m disgusted with the company not caring about this segment, which I used to be a part of. I’ll stick with iMacs and MacBook Pros, thanks. So that’s one business line, dead to me. And I have a company and buy machines for all my employees.They also have clearly exited the Wifi market, though seeing them make a small server, a Mac Mini Server perhaps, is actually interesting. But Apple would want to sell us 2 TB of SSD at $2000 or some shit, messing up the value proposition. We’d also have the “this will never be updated if you’re fool enough to buy it” issue. iCloud is nice for privacy, but not really. I happen to with in a semi-adult field, and I have to make all kinds of special scripts to make sure no adult image is uploaded to a mainstream cloud system because they check for, ah, illegal files. I am absolutely sure that a false positive would be easy to accidentally trigger. So unless Apple is going to do a peer to peer iCloud sharing system that never lives on their servers, obviously the privacy won’t be pure, and won’t be something most people would sign up for.I do think Apple will be fine. If you’re a guy, tell me...what the hell is there to do at a mall other than go to the Apple store? There are no bookstores, no toy stores. Unless I’m there to buy clothes, there’s nothing for me, only the Apple store. It is frustrating to see them taking the value out of their products by raising the price.

That's why psychics don't call YOU to let you know what they discovered about your future.  After the baby is thrown out with the bath water, the over-correction will cease because FUNDAMENTALS of AAPL show that the shares should be (and will) rebound to the mid-$200's or higher.Remember:  For every seller, there is a buyer.

I have been a long time large investor in the stock. I have made a huge amount of money over time. I am in it now and currently losing money. Not happy about that but like several times in the past when I was down high six figures, Apple always seemed to turn itself around. It's almost like being on a roller coaster: it goes up it goes down. We are sadly experiencing one of those down periods, but I have faith in the Apple leadership that this will only be a short term down period.I was surprised like most investors that Apple was no longer reporting iPhone sales. Maybe we will be spared the constant articles about falling production, no sales of new phones, etc. Apple is in the process of becoming more than a hardware company, although hardware is still an integral part of their future.",What Apple Isn't Doing

One of the problems smaller investors have with the selling for income approach is that you can only sell whole shares.

Ever notice the companies Buffett buys in total or makes investments in almost always when graphed over time go from lower left to upper right!  Now that’s a good research piece for your next article!  I think there is a statement he makes about cigar butts that goes along with this fact.,
"""Berkshire Hathaway has, ..., never started to make dividend payments"". Technically this is not entirely correct. Mr. Buffett indeed paid out a one-time dividend of $0.10 per BRK share in 1967.  Below is a quote from the book ""Buffet - the making of American capitalist"" (page 133):Buffet later said "" I must have been in the bathroom"" when the dividend  was declared. He never paid another",

Back when I was so sure I knew what I was doing.",
"Jonathan,I agree with you that Berkshire Hathaway can be great for income investors even though it does not pay a dividend.A $1,000 investment in Berkshire Hathaway in 1964 would be worth 24 million dollars today.You can pay a lot of bills with 24 million dollars.Of course, if I were a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and needed the money I would have to sell some shares.  And that goes against my never sell ideology.  However, in the case of Berkshire Hathaway, I would make an exception.  Because Berkshire Hathaway is an exceptional company.",

Separately, I also wonder if they are charging too much: they are charging BOTH sides of the marketplace, ie the car supplier and the driver.  Most internet marketplaces only charge one side, opposed to two.  And if they reduced fees to the drivers, the driver would make more money and the driver churn might decrease.  Finally, lots of competition that is better funded.  Don't own stock now but watching HYRE carefully and rooting for them.",

"Everyone has been concerned about the growth targets which are essentially pinned upon getting inventory from car dealerships and their margins. Maybe they'll get there, maybe not.My concern with this company is a little different. From the data I've seen, driving for Uber and Lyft is not particularly profitable for the average driver. Traditional cab drivers have historically made decent livings in part, I surmise, because cab supply and fares are regulated, cabs typically operate in more densely populated areas, and tipping of drivers is standard. And cab companies, I assume, have been able to earn an adequate return on their investment including a return on and of capital on the actual cabs.The typical Uber/Lyft driver operates their own car. Does the average driver earn an adequate return on both the labor and the capital they've invested in their vehicle. Is the average Uber/Lyft driver even capable of doing this calculation? I don't know, but I suspect not. That begs the question: how many ""power drivers"" are there that drive, say, 40 hours a week and generate enough fares to earn what traditional cabs have needed to be financially feasible?Also, cab companies and car rental agencies need to earn an adequate return on the vehicles they own. Any money a car dealer gets from renting a car (above and beyond the cost of servicing and depreciation of course) is probably like ""free money"" to them because the idle car isn't generating any income. Thus, does sourcing idle/surplus cars from dealers allow for Hyrecar to offer cars at lower rates than competitors?",
"Thanks for the article Gary.  I am more concerned with maintaining strong growth than liquidity.  The company burned $3.1 million in cash last quarter.  However, $1.0 million was a one time paydown of payables.  Real cash burn was about $2.1 million.  At the current revenue growth rate and gross margin expansion, the company can be profitable this quarter if they wanted to.  They are doing what most young hyper growth companies do, spending heavily on marketing and R&D.  If the revenue growth continues they will probably not need more cash as much of their non-discretionary costs are relatively fixed.  However, I would be happy if they kept up the heavy spending as long as the growth is there.  Growth investors will find them once they prove their model and become big enough to get noticed.  At that point the stock will trade over 10x revenues. Growth investors don’t care about current profits as long as there is promise of big profits down the road.  It all comes down to can they maintain the growth.   Management is making the right move going after dealers and others with fleets.",HyreCar: Gross Margin Turnaround

They already have established some leverage there, and can rapidly  capitalize on that,“Apple has been somewhat slow to develop sufficient stores in Asia. For instance, Japan represents 8.2% of company revenues. Yet it has only 9 stores, representing under 2% of stores worldwide. The first Apple store outside the USA was in fact in Tokyo.The company has a new 5 year retail initiative for Japan. We can expect further store openings there. A new store opened in Kyoto in Japan recently. This tied in specifically with the architectural heritage of Japan's old imperial capital as can be seen from the pictures here. The store will have a particular emphasis on ""Today at Apple"" programming. The revamped store at Shibuya recently re-opened.”",
"@nick Cox, Thank you for a superb article.  Tim Cook has adopted the only successful approach to Asian markets to date, based on three principles.1. Do as the Romans do.2. Focus on the consumer.3. Aim marketing at the the aspiring upper middle class.Google, Facebook, and Microsoft failed in China because they failed to observe the first principle.  Google thought that they were holier than thou when China wanted access to dissident communications.  Facebook did not want to cut back on ability of dissidents to protect.  Microsoft made the mistake of pissing off the Chinese government by introducing new versions of Windows and abandoning support of older versions that the Chinese government was using.  As you pointed out, Samsung has become a non-entity in China. That is in part because patriotism is running strong in China and Korea is a foreign power.  The price and quality of the product is not important.  Chinese are not going to buy Korean or Japanese cell phones.  Samsung should be swung a deal with Huawei or Xiaomi.  Apple is regarded as part of China and this is the truth. Apple marketing has been smart.  They emphasize quality and Chinese.  Chinese know that Apple makes the highest quality products.  They also know that Apple makes their products in China.  That combination is irresistible. Chinese are amongst the most frugal people in the world but they are also the most quality conscious and believe in spending money for quality.  The Apple strategy works for the Chinese (but unfortunately not for India).",

Regardless of which street firm they work at, the bottom line is always the same -- and lacking in accuracy.

These phones are simply not affordable and I wouldn't rely on credit expansion to fuel financing at this point in the game. Some Asian countries are wealthy of course, but definitely not the majority. If you go further to see what the cost to income ratio is (in their currency) for the consumers is I think you'll question the growth thus far. Apple needs to do a lot to maintain its current valuation and ""new"" phone sales aren't the answer. I would like to see the company pursue other revenue sources outside of what it's doing now.

"Thanks for the article.The banks in general are lackluster this year.   They have been a great investment over the previous 9 years.   Some of the performance issues this year are directly attributable to the 10y2y interest rate spread.   It has not increased as most had expected, and has been range bound between around 20-25 bps.  Long term yields are range bound due to many different factors.  So the spread has actually contracted relative to previous years.“ As general interest rate levels have been rising, BAC’s sub-par performance cannot be explained by the interest rate moves -- Bank of America or U.S. financial industry is clearly not subject to any direct or immediate tariffs. One likely possibility is that the market has priced in the forthcoming recession scenario when tariffs turn into a trade war. In other words, BAC’s lack of interest rate connection further strengthens the argument of a negative tariffs impact to the overall stock market in 2018.”",

the articles written about this company use the company projections and they seem always to be off and over inflated . There has been many questionable decisions by this mgt team. The debt is a time bomb .The free cash flow can drop quite a bit in a global slowdown which seems to be unfolding . It wouldn't surprise me if the dividend is cut or eliminated in an economy about to hit a wall. Mgt. cant buyback stock and shorts are piling on. Mgt.and even BOD own very very little  stock themselves so throwing shareholders under the bus is quite possible Also no recent insider buying with the loss of close to a billion of shareholder capital. Where is the confidence in mgt? that to me is telling,
Back to cash flow don’t forget the company projections of free cash flow is before debt repayments which look to run 30-50million per year. Don’t get me wrong I think from an earnings projection the stock looks tempting but the cash flow is borderline,
"Stock valuation looks attractive to me also, although I have gotten smoked with the stock thus far.  We are in the midst of tax loss selling and Q3 results were disappointing.

The key to a turnaround is cash flow not earnings. The large amount of debt is worrisome. That being said it is getting tempting at these prices.,

"@Trevor Soare , great to see others come to the same conclusion that I have. Lots of value to be had here. Balance sheet is in decent shape so management has time to turn around execution. This has the opportunity to throw off substantial free cash flow next year in comparison to its size as restructuring/transition costs fall off, interest savings bear fruit (secondary paying down the senior secured term loan), capital spending moderates, and margins head back north.

I can't help but shake my head and how you're pumping this stock now KIA.  Is your position here affecting your judgment or what? Cylance at best adds maybe $50 million a quarter to the bottom line but once again way short of what BB used to bring in for revenue during its heyday.  I don't see Cylance as being anything great as they are also an unprofitable operation fitting of the kind of acquisition Chen would make.Have any other of their past acquisitions made a profit since Chen opened his checkbook here?  Nada and I suspect this will be no different.  Meanwhile the guy is dumping paper and paying himself a handsome salary for doing absolutely nothing the past 6 years with this operation EXCEPT stave off a bankruptcy.,

It is always tempting, at low points, to throw in the towel. I would, too, if we were facing a calamity. Not the case. We are facing, instead, a new, better capital allocation process (poorly received by irate income investors) that first addresses debt on the back, presumably, of the TOO fiasco (plus some talk of pref and common buy-backs), before further increasing the dividend and/or addressing value-creating opportunities. Time heals most wounds and this is hardly a wound -- the market is simply offering a very poor exit right now. I agree with the thesis proposed here and elsewhere. Time to buy.",

It's just their business model.The timing is interesting, coming about a year after their first 350 deliveries. It does suggest that Delta's bean counters are not thrilled with the 350's financial performance so far. But really the 350 never made sense for Delta in the first place -- way too cutting edge for them. They probably only bought 350s because there weren't enough used 20-year-old 777s available.

Yet, it has no future orders for Boeing airplanes, outside of a handful remaining 737NGs. How big of a concern is it to Boeing that one of the world's largest airlines, who used to be very significant customer, is now only buying Airbus? -Rob",
"I am surprised by pushing so many A350s out so far.  The net result will be the maintenance and support for an ""orphan"" plane model (15 planes) which increases maintenance cost as scale economies are not achieved. I dispute the use of the word prudent for a plane model that is replacing the Delta 767's that still has a lot of planes over 25 years old, and others turning over 25 in the next few years. A little speed in replacement would be good.  A few Delta 767 incidents include: Fire SFO-DTW Sept 16, Brake fire JFK-ACC Oct 2018, Fuel leak Shanghai-Seattle Dec 2017, engine fire ANC-ATL July 2015 (25 yo at accident).",
"DAL has historically been more conservative than AAL or UAL to add capacity in wide body categories.  So the deferrals are no surprise.  DAL is demonstrating a disciplined fleet management and replacement process by ensuring that it has the options to swap future deliveries between aircraft types to better anticipate future market changes.  Due to the lukewarm demand that both the A350 and A330-900 have received, DAL has more buyer leverage with Airbus than with BA which leads to better overall aircraft pricing and ability to swap and defer future deliveries.",
"This is a very interesting move. Quite strange though that there is increase in capacity on the if they are using A321neo to replace MDs and A330neo to replace 767s - yet at the same time a move from 747 to A359 is a decline in capacity right? Do you think they might go for a A350-1000 or 777X in future for high performing international trunk routes?Airbus have now done this down-gauging exercise with TAP, Kuwait, Delta, and will likely do the same at Air Asia - which has to hurt revenue. But, at the same time, doesn't this give Airbus some room to sell  A350  to others now that they have the slots available?",

Where are yhe anal yst ipgrades for intel seeing as they blew the doors off the hinges??? None. Why? Because that would be admitting they are incompetent and or corrupt in how they led main street down the garden path re Nvda and Amd. They knew crypto would crash. They had their shorts in place while they led investors to the slaughter,
Been wondering what would happen if Bit Coin prices started to crash and will soon find out the answer.  What I wonder about is the change in coding for mining that was rumored to be implemented last summer.  Crypto farms were transitioning from GPU to ASIC to mine as the ASIC were much more energy efficient.  Now that Crypto has started crashing will the controlling powers of the mining code implement a new process code?  If the code changes the ASIC platforms become worthless compared to using GPU to mine.  The real question is who controls the process code and what stocks are they investing in?  One of the HUGE selling points of Crypto was that it was resistant to manipulation from outside entities such as the FED or big banks due to the fact the code could be changed at any time.  Looks like one of the biggest selling points is now going to have to prove its actual viability.  If Crypto doesn't implement a code change soon the coins should become worthless as the market manipulation will become evident even too the village idiot!,
"re Channel stuffing: CEO said in an interview (Gamesbeat I think):""He explained that since NVIDIA’s GTX 1080 is the top-selling GPU and AMD’s RX 580 is number 24, the ratio of GTX 1080s to RX 580s in the channel inventory is 90:10. If AMD suddenly injects RX 580 GPUs into the channel and changes the inventory ratio to 50:50, it would create excess inventory, which is difficult to sell. The sudden rise in GPU inventory because of declines in crypto-related GPU demand suggests that this instance is a one-off and not affecting its long-term growth opportunities.""So he's blaming it on AMD... who do we trust here?

"""Author may initiate a short position over the next 72 hours""Seriously? Now you're going to short NVDA after its been tanking for a month? Dropped almost in half from its 52 week high?Feel free! But clearly missed the boat.",
"First, let me say I thought the article and comments were great. I agree with the Author. About 2 years and 2 months ago I read an article on this site stating NVDA was priced to perfection at $130 and walked away agreeing with the author. The fundamentals supported $130 even with the amazing growth that was going on back then so I stayed away as I thought for the next few years this was the price point of this stock. First, lets get the obvious out of the way. Crypto currency is not likely going to last as it gets heavily regulated and the early birds start dumping to take there enormous profits. In reality, all you own is an expensive coin with no real value. I play XBOX and recieve points for when I achieve a moment in a game. Tell me what is the difference of me writing a program to mine Bitcoins or any other digital currency and playing a game to get XBOX points? What has been produced as a result of my labor besides a digital asset? My XBOX points which are also a digital asset have no value. Why would a Bitcoin or any other digital coin that can be mined? No value is formed and resources are simply wasted. Of course this is my opinion but many tulips were sold once upon a time. Then the music stopped and the exits were blocked.Second is the data center issue. Lets think about this question economically. I will premise this by saying I am not an expert in data centers and the infrastructure needed to run one. What I did do is read a few articles where NVDA bulls stated how great NVDA was and how they were going to destroy the market and reap 60% margins. My response was simple, if you are making 60% margins and must disclose such margins to the public you are inviting competition. Competition will catch up and either offer an inferior product at a drastically lower rate that gets the job done or will invest the required capital to come close, tie, or get ahead of  the Company with 60% margins. Capitalism is designed to do this to any Company making excessive margins.Third, writers on this site really ignore Porter's 5 Forces. I hate to say it but a comprehensive financial analysis along with an analysis using this system is almost guarenteed to tell an investor what a stock will do short and long term. I hold positions in two stocks that I am losing my butt on. BIDU and JD. Porter analysis and financial analysis show these stocks should be good investments, however a trade war and a 5% growing economy evidently are not enough to fuel the growth. However, I will admit I did not do extensive enough research on either stock and I should have taken emotion out and put a sell floor on both. Instead I am sitting on some hefty losses. But lesson learned and I think both will recover. I am actually looking to add to both stocks as both hold dominant postions in China, but I will not make the same mistake again.",

"""much of the datacenter growth in the recent past year has been due to ASP increases and not unit growth"". Anybody have more insight into use of NVDA GPU here.....my experience here is they would only use GPU for specialized applications. And only the biggest Data Centers with lots of money for cutting edge semi-experimental big data analysis. So I have been skeptical of their claims into commercial data center growth. Mainstream AMD chips have always had a place in the commercial data center.",
"The author has provided no evidence to support his claim that growth in datacenter has been entirely due to price and not volume.  And while the growth in gaming coincides with crypto, there's no evidence that all of the growth is due entirely to crypto, in fact there's lots of evidence in the market that there has been strong growth in gaming but it's reasonable to assume that some of it is from crypto.  There was likely no benefit to 3Q from crypto so it's probably a reasonable proxy for normalized results but it might take a a couple or a few quarters to get there, 4G guidance is probably what is generally called a kitchen sink.A/R going from 1.66 to 2.22 is an increase of 34%, not a near doubling.  Lastly, to arbitrarily put a 10X multiple on what might be a temporarily low earnings estimate appears alarmist or self-serving to me.  And remember beauty is in the eye of the beholder, that might be its value to you but to say it's the defacto fair value requires some real math.",

"I'm not an active investor, not a technology expert, and I don't study the company closely, but here are my thoughts:Nvidia is completely dominant in high-end graphics and arguably AI. They're a great long-term bet. I think, however, that their timing around this latest release isn't great. They've effectively gone all-in on Turing, even though the ~2 year old Pascal tech was still unrivaled and more than you'd need to run all but the most demanding 4k applications.While they may realize some economies by shifting to a single architecture in manufacturing, I'm guessing they had to give up some margin on the Turing line in order to keep it price-competitive with similarly-powerful previous gen boards (e.g. RTX 2070 ~= GTX1080 in price and performance).The other big issue is that the new hardware contains ray-tracing tech that has minimal value. There's the short-term problem that very few applications support it. Longer-term, however, these cards just don't have the horsepower to run ray tracing at greater than 1080p / 60fps. If I'm a gamer choosing between slightly better looking graphics that struggle to hit 60fps @ 1080p, when I could instead choose slightly cruddier lighting and hit 90+ fps @ ultrawide or 4k, I'll take the latter every time. And for competitive gamers, anything under 100 fps is a deal-breaker. I actually own an RTX 2080 ti, and I have never even attempted to turn on raytracing despite owning two applications that support it.Then there's the AI tech, which Nvidia is trying to shoehorn into a graphics technology by doing some fancy anti-aliasing stuff that can apparently double fps compared to other techniques. Again, games need to support the tech for it to have value, but I believe they eventually will. I wonder, though, how many of the same tricks might work on lower-end hardware, and how much all of this matters as resolutions climb and images get sharper even without top-end antialiasing.All this is to say that I think Nvidia is in for a rough couple of years. The next generation of cards, however, will enjoy robust support in the software market for both ray tracing and AI-enhanced imaging... and they will have the power to run it all at 4k. Unless AMD / Intel do something totally unexpected, in that new world Nvidia will be even further ahead of its rivals than it has been for the last few years.If I actively traded on my own account, I'd wait for the inevitable announcement of some cool new tech from AMD / Intel, which will probably hammer Nvidia stock further, and then go long Nvidia with a 12-18 month timeline.",
"If you have NVDA, just relax, don't sell, it'll get back, whatever goes down goes up and vice versa, don't let these analysts scare you, they just try to get your money out of your histerya",
"If we agree with the street forecast for the earnings picture and assume the earnings as the available cash for shareholders, with a discount rate of levered equity 11,5% (rf=2.5% and beta of 1.5) then to value NVDA at $140 the perpetual growth rate would be 3.5% which is lower than economy growth rate (2% inflation + 2% real growth). To value the company at $50 the growth rate would need to be -20%, or the street forecasts to be cut in half and a perpetual growth rate of 0%",
"You state that inventory jumped to $1.42B from $1.09B in Q2 and $797M in Q1 and that it is at least a two quarter problem, but they revised down revenues for the next quarter in $700M - which is basically the increase of inventories since Q1, so I do not see why this statement from management is so wrong.",

this has been the 50th article on negatively on nvda in a few days thebthedata isn't even that bad. seems more of an attempt to take some power away from tech,
"I've been an NVDA bear throughout the year just like you. However, this research seems biased to me. The jump in inventories is related to a combination of crypto hangover and a major product introduction. Comparison with Pascal launch quarters would have been a valid point here instead of last quarters.""Compared to what would be normal operations, Nvidia has borrowed about $1B of sales from next quarter"". You are referring here to a situation where a huge stockpile of disassembled mining rigs affects sales outlook. This is a temporary setback and not normal operations. Without these factors, growth profile shouldn't be flattish. I'm not a huge fan of manually adjusting target multiples as it always leads to bias overshoots.",
"haha called it- wiggens set the price at 80 and I said why not 50. Now a call for 50 , I say why not 25? The bears might be winning this market cycle, but they don't understand the NVDA thesis or maybe the moats involved. AMD doing well with CPUs - say, vs Intel, doesn't make their GPUs suddently become preformance / watt effecient vs NVDA, and that's the defining competitive metric of data acceleration. Also, while I'll agree there are problems with the RTX launch, gamers don't typically buy the argument that an AMD CPU system gets better with an AMD GPU: I think that theory popped with the Phenom releases of yesteryear. I'm also slightly at odds with the mainstream opinion: I'm still not convinced it was a crypto bubble that popped : I think it was a badly marketed / released Turing launch, which saw customers rushing to buy last gen Pascal cards, which I suspect ( no proof )  NVDA had booked the sales from. I'm getting this idea from some vender Surveys done by Gamers Nexus which pegged the 1080TI as outselling all Turing and lesser Pascal cards combined. There's our problem. Anyway, the article makes no mention of the technical achievement of marrying AI software & RT cores in hardware, or of the AI platforms NVDA is developing today for tomorrow's markets ( IE, Auto).  Anywho, longs still have plenty to look forward to. glta.",

NVDA owns the end-to-end stack powering that secular trend, from metal to high-layer SW. And we are still in the early innings of it.Looking at the facts, we have datacenter at $3.2B annualized and growing at mid double-digits, PRO+Auto at $2B and growing at high teens, gaming at $4.5B (ex-crypto demand) and likely with mid to high single digit growth going forward.I'd say $85B (NVDA's current marketcap) is a fair price to pay for those businesses.After many years, NVDA is looking once again like a BUY.",
"$50 is about 3x book value (pardon me if I introduce a little bit of the fundamentals into the calculus).  So you see the business itself (net of theoretical liquidation value) as only worth about $34.  Just for perspective & since you brought it up as a direct comparison, I think AMD's value beyond liquidation could actually be greater than that  right now (their book value is $1.13/shr,. and they have a lot more shares, not to mention some big dilutions still unrealized due to convertibles which I haven't even figured in).  So you are essentially saying that AMD's business are worth significantly more than Nvidia's in absolute terms, since you simultaneously have the position that AMD is going up from here.Interesting call.  I'm not going to argue it, I jsut thought I'd give that context.  Not sure what else to say, except that maybe to the extent that ""irrational exuberance"" may have taken this too far, it's also pretty normal in corrections for the motivated pessimists to not see soberly either.

I bet there are many buyers who are now hoping for a miracle reversal.

Neurocrine reported $40,466K in collaboration revenue of which $40 million was a milestone payment, which leaves the balance of $466K as royalties.  Assuming a royalty rate of 20% that means revenues for Orilissa were around $2.3 million, which I find very disappointing.  Some are speculating that there are formulary issues with the new drug as they are far cheaper (and less effective) treatments for endometriosis.

"The FDA, Doctors, and Insurance:       Christiana, I retired from Big Pharma. I spent a 26 years dealing with this industry, mush of it selling and training on heart drugs such as streptokinase, Lasix, Altace, and Cardizem, I learned a few things to my dismay.       Doctors, even cardiologist, don’t keep up with current literature. They have all been told retrospective fish oil studies show fish oil doesn’t work. Companies selling the LDL drugs now on the market will be sure to remind them of that study.      If the FDA should not extend  cardioprotective labeling benefits Big Pharma competition will be sure to remind doctors, ""it’s just another fish oil.”  Yes, there will be doctors that will try it and judge for themselves, but it will never get the market penetration it deserves.      Insurance will never give Vascepa teir 1 pricing without the mortality benefits labeling. Doctors need to know they can write it without prior authorization. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Doctors don’t want more paper work and this may be required to be done for each and every refill, dependent on what each company requires.      That being said I believe Vascepa will get the labeling. The FDA is committed in that they signed off on the clinical trial design and the use of mineral oil being used as the placebo. They were already very aware of the questions concerning “mineral oil” but signed off on it any way. If they tried to reject the labeling they probably would be sued again and they would probably loose again. JUST MY TAKE: Regards, Joel",
"Bulls and bears are missing one important thing in this story. This is a statistical game. FDA will chop and dice the data. They have to be given all the raw data for analysis. There will be surprises, big ones. Given the fact that the ANCHOR trial had the same issues, FDA is NOT going to ignore and discount any of the flags with Vascepa. It is not about mineral oil but that is the start!",

Great article & fantastic points.  I have to say AMRN is really trading on its buyout prospects,

"The FDA (Hamburg) + BP/Hedge funds + minions already screwed AMRN once; if you see how sp reacted (10/7 - 10/11/13) before ANCHOR ADCOM, the fix was in; if the present FDA tries to do it again with the data and facts out now, it would be really f'd up and bordering on evil",
"As much as I'm pulling for Vascepa's success (long AMRN), I think this article is a little overly optimistic. Per twitter, a lot of cardiologists were wary of the mineral oil issue (although even the skeptics acknowledged they believe there was SOME benefit). Their reported compromise with this uncertainty is to only prescribe Vascepa to those who fit the current FDA criteria. I think an FDA rejection of label expansion will severely cut into Amarin's revenue, as well as severely rock the stock price. If by long-term you're thinking 10 years from now, then yes, maybe Amarin may do better than it is currently. However, 2-5 years from now has the potential to be severely impacted.",

"Excellent, well reasoned article which clearly states the case that Vascepa is a win-win for Amarin and investors. The only issue is whether the share price will benefit in the short term. I would agree with the author's thesis completely(as opposed to 99%), if she had included an analysis of the current FDA leadership and whether the political climate is more positive for an accelerated approval. If there is a greater likelihood that expanded labelling will be fast tracked, the stock will appreciate in the short term. If FDA label expansion is delayed, the share price will increase, albeit at a slower pace. The other issue is valuation for a buy out. If FDA label expansion is quick, an offer may come sooner. If delayed, a buy out will be at a higher level and will have to take into account increase sales. In any event, share holders win.",
The insurers will definitely not pay unless FDA approves the label extension.,
Pharmacy benefits managers are trending towards only paying for the exact label,
"Good points, but as I mentioned in another article, the key question is whether insurers will cover off label use.  The cost is still and always an issue.  If coverage becomes widely available, then Amarin will have definitely already won, and the FDA decision on their sNDA will become almost moot.  This is the ultimate goal, and insurers would be foolish not to provide coverage as the benefits of Vascepa will reduce their exposure to much more expensive conditions and their respective treatments (hospitalization, surgery, rehab, etc).  This is really a financial no-brainer for insurers.  Let’s hope they see it this way.",
"Vascepa has one of the best safety records of any drug that I follow. The FDA will review changes in the blood chemistry of the placebo arm, but even the most vocal critics do not claim that all of the positive effects seen with Vascepa in REDUCE-IT could be accounted for by those changes. Because of those considerations, and because similar blood chemistry changes were seen in placebo arms in trials that did not include mineral oil, I think FDA approval is overwhelmingly likely. Sooner or later, someone in this thread will say, ""But it's only fish oil."" It happens with almost every AMRN article. If Vascepa is just fish oil, then penicillin is just fungus piss.",
"""85% of doctors polled have already indicated that they intend to prescribe Vascepa to their high-triglyceride patients regardless of the drug’s official label.""

"It's certainly an interesting moment in the gaming market, which is still for the moment Nvidia's bread & butter.  They have tough comparables coming up for the switch, as well as all these GPU concerns (with even harder comparables there due to crypto), and I think the argument for the price premium for DLSS and RTX is still murky.  My hunch is that latter concern mostly dissipates when they come out with a TSMC 7nm Turing ""21xx"" series early next year -- I'm hopeful that will be a seminal GPU generation, even more than Pascal was -- but even if that's less than 6 months on the calendar that looks a very long way off right now in ""market time.""Unfortunately, to set the table for that 7nm Turing they needed to prime the games pump now by getting the less price conscious/bleeding edge to adopt RTX now.  I'm starting to wonder if we'll even see a 2060, they may just go straight to 2160 at 7nm, and maybe in the meantime cut the 2070 and 2080 prices when they roll out 2180?  Just spitballing, given that it's simultaneously really hard to see a 2060 coming out until at least next year given inventory, or them not announcing 7nm consumer cards at GTc next year, which is relatively early on the calendar for 2019 (March 18).I have hope that Datacenter and auto can ""pick up more of the load"" in supporting the share price before all that can play out, but that is only a hope.",

"""If moviegoers were willing to cough up ~$10 to see Black Panther, a movie that ended up grossing nearly $1.35 billion, imagine how much a subscriber would be willing to pay for Disney+ to see Black Panther 2 on demand.""That's exactly the sort of thinking that would get DIS into trouble. People don't sign up for a streamer to see a movie. If you want to see that title you can rent it on iTunes, Amazon, or Vudu. The ""going rate"" for first-run movie rentals is around $5.99. Or you can simply buy it an watch it as often as you like. DIS currently charges $19.99 for their movies, but sales can bring that down to $14.99 or even $9.99 if you're patient. Expecting people to commit themselves to a monthly subscription requires a constant stream of offerings, not one or two ""big movies"". Building a catalog around ""blockbusters"" will at best result in high subscriber churn as people sign up for a month, watch the latest big movies, then drop until the ""goodie basket"" refills (the way people sign up for HBO to watch the latest season of GoT and then drop it). The bottom line is recycling theatrical offerings won't build a successful streaming service. You need original content that's exclusive to the streaming service that people want to see, and enough of it so that churn is minimized. If you throw in some recycled movies, that's a ""nice to have"" but isn't a deciding factor. The problem with those ""blockbusters"" is that precisely because they made so much money at the box office, most people have probably already seen it, and most of those who'd want to see it again probably already own it.Will Disney+ do this?

I am long MRK and JNJ but realize I may need to sell MRK gradualy in 3-5 yrs to purchase PHIZER as their new products come on line,
I own some shares.  They need more diversification beyond Keytruda to make up for all the products losing patents.,
Merck is on a monster roll. Keytruda has been projected to hit 25 billion a year. The trajectory looks favorable. Plus big pharma will be a good holding in the market volatility,
"Since Oct. 10 of this year, MRK's share price has dipped down about 7% to 10% three times. Therefore, I would wait for MRK, which closed today at $76.35, to pull back again into the low to mid-$70s before opening or adding to a position in MRK. Of course, this is given from the perspective of someone who owns MRK in two accounts, and for about two decades. Anyone who is anxious to buy before the next ex-div. date, Yahoo Finance shows Dec. 13. Also, MRK is 26 cents off a new 52 week high. made today, and after the dips noted in the first sentence above, MRK had a 3 to 5 day run of up days in a row. Today, MRK showed a third day in a row of green arrows up. Momentum being a powerful thing, MRK has been going up and to the right since May 8 on a year-to-date chart. So maybe it won't pull back as much as recent history might indicate. This probably depends on sector rotation and the overall dip in the broader markets, which were hit today by declines in FAANG stocks and their kin.",Merck Has Made All The Right Moves In 2018

"""I believe current prices are not sustainable and it should recover driving DQ stock price to its intrinsic value.""  Why is that? Plus what do you think about the demand side? If China raises solar installation target to 210 GW in 2020, that means only 20-25 GW new capacity annually. DQ is completely undervalued at this price and over-punished by the market, but I don't think ASP will bounce back as you expected.",
thanks for the post,
"I also do not share the view that prices will go back to USD 15 for mono. Still, I think all the new capacities (seems at 180 thousand by my count) in 2019-2020 will just replace the multi polySi as this seems the new industry standard. Still with this much capacities added I would think that current prices are there to stay for 2019. In lack of discipline of the remaining Chinese producers it will likely go down once saturation point for mono is achieved in 2020. Interestingly even if mono falls to 8 per kilo in 2021, Daqo will be quite a profitable operation. I may imagine a return of equity price to USD 35 or even 40 once the news on Chinese regulations is finally out in 1Q19",
"One other issue that's somewhat tangential to ASPs is that I think there are substantial risks related to the funding of Daqo's phase 4A expansion. From the Q3 conference call it seems like they have a bank loan in place to (almost) cover this year's costs, but it's unclear how they'll pay the (larger) amount required in 2019.They may end up diluting shareholders again (as they've done repeatedly in the past) at the worst possible time. Alternatively, they may take on too much debt and over leverage themselves during a glut.",
"I have to say, I'm really surprised by this price target and the author's forecast for polysilicon ASPs (in China) to return to $15. Is the latter forecast based entirely on the cost curve taken from REC's earnings report or is there some other justification? Do you know the source of REC's numbers? Does it include the new capacity coming online now and slated to come online in 2019? I can't help but wonder how accurate/useful this chart is, given that ASPs have remained below $12 in China for 5+ months now.For what it's worth, Daqo themselves are not predicting a return to $15 ASPs. They said they expect $11-12 in Q1 2019, and $12-13 in the second half of 2019. Of course, they have an incentive to talk their own book and have proven to be overly optimistic about ASPs since the 5/31 decision. During their Q2 conference call they said they believed June would be the ASP trough and pricing would recover through the end of the year. In particular, they said they expected mono ASPs in the 95-105 RMB/kg range (that includes VAT) for the rest of the year. Per EnergyTrend, current prices are 80-84 RMB/kg.Given the new low cost capacity coming online and the continuing unwillingness of higher cost producers in China to shut down production, I think there's a good chance poly ASPs actually decline in 2019, rather than recover. Expecting to see economically rational behavior from Chinese solar companies has not historically been a good bet.It's also worth noting that on the Q2 conference call Daqo said they expected 200 kT of high cost poly capacity to be shut down but on the Q3 call have walked that back to 100 kT. I wouldn't consider DQ to be cheap at $24. In fact, barring a significant policy change from China, I expect the share price to fall into the teens over the coming months. In my view, the market is currently pricing DQ as if a turnaround is imminent, but I think that's unlikely. The last major boom-bust cycle in the polysilicon sector took years to play out and I haven't seen much evidence that this time will be different.",
"Thanks for the analysis. Major competitors of DQ are also expanding low-cost capacity though, which may keep prices down and lessen DQ's competitive advantage. Is that a concern?",
good analysis of supply side.any future demand projections,
"unless I am missing something.. or some major accounting fraud, there is no reason for a company in a growth industry, expanding capacity, with GM of 20% even after major product price collapse, to be trading at a P/B of 0.5.... it makes no sense. I am always wondering if I am missing something.",

The data demonstrate an increase in median overall survival in HCT-TMA patients treated with OMS721 compared to a matched historical control (347 days vs. 21 days, respectively, by Kaplan-Meier analysis; p < 0.0001 by log-rank test).""He TRIES to argue that demonstrates superiority for OMS721. Alas, his argument is NOT convincing..At the Webush presentation in AUGUST:www.google.com/......referring to what appears the SAME trial, OMER said:""100-day survival 53% vs 10% (p = 0.0002)""So, on ONE hand, median survival is 347 days while, on the OTHER hand, 100-day survival is 53%.WHAT does this tell us?Once again, it brings out the WEAKNESS of the MEDIAN value. Since we AREN'T given the ACTUAL numbers, he have to DEDUCE what it might mean. So, we have 19 patients and 9 are still alive at 100 days. We COULD imagine a data set like this:(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,347,347,347,347,347,347,347,347,347,347)The median is 347 days. That's EXTREME but it gets the idea across.Now in THIS paper:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.....the median survival time for soliris treated patients was 130 days which at first, might SEEM worse.  But SUPPOSE the data were THIS:(129,129,129,129,129,129,129,129,130,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600)The MEDIAN is 130 but overal the results are arguably SUPERIOR to those of TMS721.The THING is, of course, we DON'T have the ACTUAL data, so we really CAN'T make ANY conclusions based on the MEDIAN -- i.e. we CANNOT TRUST that data in passing judgement on superiority.On the OTHER hand, overall survival was 14 MONTHS for 33% of the patients taking soliris, while for OMS721, it was 50% at 100 DAYS.NOW the question is whether 33% at 14 MONTHS is better or worse than 50% at 100 days? I suppose that's a matter for the reimburser actuaries to decide.Similar analysis applies to THIS paper:ash.confex.com/...""Largest Reported Series of Adults Who Received Treatment with Eculizumab (ECU) for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy(TA-TMA). a Single Center Experience""""Median survival for the entire cohort was 130 days (range 6-833 days...""NOTE the RANGE. It's VERY wide and we have NO NOTION of how those numbers are distributed.AND:""Median follow-up was 4.5 months after initiation of ECU. Eight (53.3%) patients had complete resolution of TA-TMA...""In OTHER words, we DO know that at around 150 days, 53% were still alive. So while OMS721 did almost as WELL as soliris, reimbursers are NOT impressed by ""non-inferior"" UNLESS the drug is CHEAPER and, of course, by the time OMS721 makes it to market, if ever, there will LIKELY be several GENERIC eculizumabs floating around.",

Clinicians are ALREADY using soliris for every TMA problem under the sun!""Of course they are, its an approved drug being used off label (OMS721 cannot be purchased yet, so they use second best ) and considering there is nothing else that can save these people it will be approved for insurance reimbursement. Don't try to think its something special. Anyone with a death sentence would want to try anything regardless of side effects and a doctor would be remiss not to try them as well. And yes it does help some but with many side effects and not with the same #'s as 721 ha shown so far.

Author said The initial results from the Phase 2 trial showed a significant treatment effect in IgAN in reduction of both uACR and Proteinuria.I was unaware beating a placebo by .4% (18% placebo vs 18.4% 721) was deemed significantly positive. Extension data unblinded and uncontrolled therefore meaningless. Comical to claim 721 superiority in ahus compared to soliris when omeros has been mute on the program and soliris is basically a cure. I could go on and on but your thesis lacks facts,
"To add clarity since the registered Oms721 trial doesn't specify. I made the assumption that OMS721 clinical trial looks at allogeneic transplant TMA patients only because of the assumptions used in defining the historical control per management's HSCT data press release from Feb. 2018...""An historical control that best matched the OMS721-treated population was identified from the literature. The literature reference selection criteria were those studies that specified: (1) individual patient data (required for analysis), (2) adult and/or adolescent populations, (3) allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients only, and (4) no or partial response to immunosuppressive regimen modification.""",
I appreciate your insight.  I feel like my knowledge just doubled.,
"@quiteruggedNot sure I understand what you mean by eculizumab treating at the headwaters.  I don't think either OMS721 or eculizumab will be given prophylactically until there is more evidence of benefit.  What is more interesting in the near term is to compare the two in the treatment of HSCT TMA.  The referenced study has a pretty short follow-up period (median 4.5 months).  Long term survival will be the key but hematological data points can provide some pretty good insight into overall effectiveness without looking at long term survival.  8 out of 15 with a complete TMA resolution doesn't scream superiority when comparing to OMS721 data known to this point. 4 of 8  were autologous transplant patients (Total of 5 of the 15 were autologous).  OMS721 clinical trial looks at allogeneic transplant TMA patients only, which is far more common.  It would be interesting to understand the historical prognosis in autologous vs allogeneic transplant TMA.  Could allogeneic provide more complexities and challenges and therefore skew the overall results when comparing to an OMS721 trial?  It seems reasonable to believe they could but I have not looked into this.But back to the question at hand.  I think eculizumab has and will continue to see off-label use in HSCT TMA.  Omeros will have to compete with them to an extent.  However, couldn't the same argument be made for Oms721 receiving benefits from off-label use?  Personally, I believe that is a big reason the EMA is encouraging management to apply for full approval rather than conditional approval.  Conditional approval would create a barrier for off-label use.  Would it provide European doctors an alternative to eculizumab in conditions other than HSCT TMA (i.e. other primary/secondary ahus)?The number of countries without access to eculizumab is large.  The vast majority do not have access.  Even if OMS721 shows equivalent efficacy to eculizumab, I believe there is strong potential for immediately capturing international market share in HSCT TMA or AHUS.  To better understand the immediate market potential I'd look directly at enrollment demographics. Where are the enrolled patients coming from in the OMS721 trial?  Right now I only know the location of one patient and she was the compassionate use case from Italy.  Eculizumab failed in her case.  I'm going to assume a majority of the enrollment is coming outside of the US but probably not like ahus which I'd bet is almost exclusively international patients.",

"From the Omeros website:""MASP-2 is recognized as the effector enzyme, and is required for the function, of the lectin pathway, one of the principal complement activation pathways.""Even ignoring the poor punctuation, I don't know that I agee.Here is the lectin path:www.pnas.org/...That shows that MASP-1 is self-activating and also activates MASP-2 and C4. Also:""Subsequent work, however, separated MASP1 from MASP2 (605102) and showed that MASP1 activates C3 and C2, whereas MASP2 activates C4 and C2.""Now IF MASP-1 can activate C2, C3, C4 of the complement cascade, then that SUGGESTS that it is capable of BYPASSING the MASP-2 blockade to activate the rest of path.THAT then means that blocking MASP-2 may not do much of anything to block complement activation.So I went back and tried to find out whether OMER ever actually MEASURED serum complement levels in their early reserach.

So stop the nonsense with what PBMs will do or not and your claim that OMS 721 has to be superior.And in all your links to the million studies you found, there i nothing about an outcome in adult patients with said disease.But I found one:RESULTS:All 12 patients had severe TMA with neurological and/or renal involvement. Fifty-eight percent were refractory to first-line plasma exchange. At the time of TMA diagnosis, infections were present in 50% of the patients and acute graft-versus-host disease in 33%. Patients were treated with Eculizumab according to the aHUS therapeutic scheme. With a median follow-up of 14 months, hematological response and overall survival were 50% and 33%, respectively. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/...33% after 14 months, so MOS of almost a year is really looking attractive compared to that from a patient's view.",

"Dr. George Crist From his "" Omeros: OMS-721 And HST-TMAs, What Does It All Mean?""  article.Worth the read.img1.wsimg.com/...""To date, Omeros has so far reported 19 HST-TMA patients that have been treatedwith OMS-721. In January, the company updated the survival information for OMS-721 treated patients with a median of 347 days vs. a historical control value of 21days. While the selection of 21 days as the appropriately paired control value iscertainly subject to investigator bias, the survival numbers are fantastic.It’s also worth getting in the weeds a little bit with the treatment parameters.Patients are eligible to receive study drug only in a sub-population of TMA patientswho have a poor prognosis. Specifically, once a patient is classified as having TMA,the immunosuppression regimen is changed first (elimination of Calcineurininhibitors), then if the TMA is persistent after two weeks, only then is the patientable to receive the study drug. The studies that I have reviewed talk about survivalnumbers from HST-TMA in general and are not reflective of persistent TMA twoweeks after CNI withdraw. So, 21 days may, in fact, be a good number. But forgetabout the numbers for a moment and reflect upon the following. The overallmortality for patients in this state should have been close to 75%. Of the 19patients treated, 4 died. One died from disease progression (remember 41% ofpatients die from cancer relapse post-HST), two died from neutropenic sepsis(complications from the HST) and one possibly due to study drug, but realisticallydied because it was too late for effective treatment to occur. The other obvious point here is that the other 15 patients are still alive. 79% survival in thispopulation is beyond good, it’s amazing.A treatment protocol immediately following TMA diagnosis (instead of waiting twoweeks) would likely be even more curative. Better yet, incorporating OMS-721 intothe post-transplant regimen would probably also be of value in terms of preventingGvHD. It would also expand the market for the drug logarithmically. If I wereOmeros, a phase 3 trial for GvHD would be one of my next targets after theapprovals for IgAN and HST-TMA were knocked down. The GvHD data in MBLdeficient patients are too compelling not to chase this. Incidentally, a trial for GvHDwould not need to be limited to HST, it could be for other transplant procedures aswell, especially kidney. I thought it was telling in their January press release that inaddition to giving background on HST-TMA, they also gave background on GvHD.Hinting maybe? Time will tell.""",

"Good summary of what got us to where we are now and the upside that remains. I have a few points/questions:Ahus: You say they will initiate a P3 trial soon at the end of your ahus overview but there is an active P3 study that’s enrolling (slowly) that you mention previously. Also, to my knowledge soliris is pretty remarkable from an efficacy standpoint in ahus. Im not aware of anemia issues once on soliris for extended time. Certainly there are safety advantages to oms721. Anemia in pnh is pretty prevalent with patients on soliris due to extravascular hemolysis.Hsct tma: Are the numbers you/management use regarding the prevalence of hsct misleading since the path to accelerated/full approval is currently focused on “high risk” hsct tma? Maybe there isn’t little difference but I’m under the conservative assumption that it is a sub population of your total. I could be wrong.What are your assumptions estimating a Q3 EMA approval for in hsct tma if they submit in Q1? If accelerated approval then EMA process takes 150 days excluding clock stoppage for responses from the company. I like your Q3 date but is it too optimistic?

Agree with everything you said. I am ultra long OMER.,
Spectacular summation of the situation.  Just an additional note....  It appears Alexion infringed on patents held by Chugai (a 66% owned subsidiary of Roche) in making Alxn1210.  Alxn is a bug compared to Roche even with its massively overvalued cap.  Unless Alexion kisses the ring on its replacement for Soliris there's a real chance it never sees the market.  Less competition for Omeros in aHUS.,
A possibility: Omeros runs the table with 721 and generates in excess of $10B a year. If there is no further dilution it's a possible $1000-$2000/share. Guaranteed? No. Likely (IMO)? Yes. That is a hell of a risk/reward ratio and a good chunk of the Bull thesis. Cures for addiction and cancer add a little bit to these totals.,

"It is easy to understand why SLP gets targeted every year or so by these types of short articles. It has, in my mind, surprisingly little to do with the operating fundamentals of SLP as a company and more to do with the qualities of SLP as a stock that make it ripe for this type of predatory activity. What are these qualities? High insider ownership (with the founder holding around 30% of the shares - a good thing in my mind), low float, a small market cap and the stock hitting 52 week highs make the company ripe for shorts especially in an inflated broader market. How does this work? Once a short position is established, the negative news (often shrouded in half truths and baseless  assertions) can cause some shareholders new to the name to panic and exit their position, depressing shares in the short term due to supply demand liquidity issues. Once a short term depression in price is produced due to the low liquidity and small size of the stock, short sellers cover and make significant near term money and move on.  The same thing happened with another outfit targeting SLP a few years ago - I encourage investors to investigate how that turned out.Long term investors should welcome lower prices on such a quality company. This is little more than a transitory nuisance.I have been Long SLP for many years.",

"@The Owl Thanks again for the very thorough article and for the great discussion it provoked. Could you tell me a sign that would demonstrate to you that your thesis was right or wrong; that CBL is. or is not, making appropriate changes?",
"Here are a few things to consider with CBL:- The biggest price drops have come from dividend cuts. Actual changes to the fundamentals have had a much smaller effect. This indicates that the price is driven more by the dividends over the next 12 months than the potential over the next 3 years. If you don't care about income it could be very mispriced.- Despite the fears of the common stock being wiped out, bonds are only trading at a 20% discount.- Prior to the latest cut, the dividend yield investors demanded was over 20%. Even before the announcement of a potential cut it was around 15%. Now it's 11%, which is much closer to what stable businesses are yielding.This shows that there is confidence that the bottom is near. A small increase in confidence could cause investors to send the price up.Personally I don't pay a lot of attention to that because I look for ways that the business can return capital to me regardless of others' opinions. But if you are concerned this is worth remembering.",

"There is one route CBL can take in order to survive: (1) start paying a stock dividend, to the extent possible to stay within the REIT regs, (2) halt dividends on the preferred and start accumulating them (yes, this will result in pref holders eventually going on the board within 2 years) (3) issue equity...the 43.4mm shares short would cover on an equity deal, and maybe some institutional investors would get long. I know management well, and sadly they have neither the foresight nor ability to do any of the things required for survival.You are probably ok owning the prefs, but you must understand that it’s a risky investment and that you will likely start being paid on an accrual basis within the next two years, after which it will be a hard slog to get paid back in whole. The best you can hope for is becoming part of the new equity stack, but being pref holders, that is unlikely given that it’s the worst security to own when there are real issues. Their ‘23, ‘24 and ‘26 bonds are trading at 80c and they will trade lower as they are about to be primed by at least $500mm of new secured debt (due to the line and term loan renegotiation).There are two ways to play this (if you want to make money): (1) short the stock or (2) buy the fulcrum bonds after they renegotiate their LOC/Term Loans and hope that the company does the right thing by filing (11) within the next two years. This has been obvious since the day they went unsecured. Granted, the stock has been a disaster since then, but it can always go down another 100%. Do you really want to risk your capital based on a stock chart and flimsy math on this website?  I don’t care what retail does as I’m an institutional investor, but I am trying to help people who listen to “the owl” and others on this site.

Add a couple percent in interest rate for the risk factor of malls and this could be very profitable for all sides.Good luck.",

CompoundingWould you please explain to readers what the significance is of Moodys reporting low covenant quality impact on CBL.?Please tell us relevance.  What does a CBL investor do with that info?,
"Reading the latest back and forth about CBL, my sense is that they have levers remaining to pull and odds are their doom is being over-forecast.The issues with Sears, JCP, Macys, et al are very well known to CBL and other retail REITs.  It might turn out to be ironic that CBL et al tier 2/3 mall/strip REITs will look good as the luxury end of things undergoes contraction.  Mr. Market likes irony.There seems to be complacency about premium retail REITs like SPG continuing to dominate the sector.  IMO there is a secular turn going on just underneath the surface.  Look at what is happening with Apple and its XR etc $1K+ latest Iphones phlopping (which will evince as weakening numbers from their tier-1 mall stores -- you heard it here first.)  Heck, think about the reversal of complacency as the FAANG mother-of-bubbles (MOB) continues to deflate: the wealth-reduction impact that is having on high end consumerism.  (Luxury real estate is another MOB deflating.)  The recent fires and wealth destruction in California are another data point.  Last not least, the top ticking implications of Amazon's building 2 new HQ sites, seeing worker strikes in Europe, ...Bottom line, can things get so bad they exceed pessimism built into CBL's current stock price?

"Here's what Investopedia says with regards to covenants:""When an issuer violates a bond covenant, it is considered to be in technical default. A common penalty for violating a bond covenant is the downgrading of a bond's rating, which could make it less attractive to investors and increase the issuer's borrowing costs. For example, Moody's, one of the major credit rating agencies in the United States, rates a bond's covenant quality on a scale of 1 to 5, with five being the worst. This means that a bond with a covenant rating of five is an indication that covenants are being violated consistently. In May 2016, Moody's reported that overall covenant quality in the market declined to 4.56 from 3.8 the previous month.""A temporary violation may be an incremental difficulty, but not necessarily an instant end to the business.",
"While I think the analysis is thoughtful, there are a few mistakes and you don’t point out the biggest issues. (1) the book value analysis is incorrect.  You are not picking up the non-OP minority interest of $79mm. So the BV is 2.09. Also, your second BV calc is wrong because the balance sheet already includes investments of non-controlling affiliates ($275mm on the asset side), and backs out $74mm which is part of the $79mm that you missed in the first BV calc). Page 18 of the supp should make this all clear. So in the second analysis you are adding in $183mm of equity THAT IS ALREADY ACCOUNTED FOR on their balance sheet under the equity method.  So now that we understand that the second BV calc is just wrong, let’s go back to the first one: you are not accounting for $170mm of intangible assets (85c a share).  So their real BV is $1.23/share ($2.09 -$0.85).  I don’t really care that much for a book value based analysis but since you spent so much time on it I at least wanted to correct you. My biggest problems with your analysis are the following:(1) They are close to breaching their second debt covenant on page 25mm. They have $491mm of cushion as of 9/30 before they are in breach of that covenant. However they have $896 in unsecured term loans and lines of credit due within the next three years.  They are currently working to restructure them and make them largely secured secured lines and term loans.  They’re lying and bank lenders may be willing to change the covenant in order to get the refinancing is done but bondholders certainly will not and they have a cushion of $741mm on the same covenant for the bonds.  The company seemed optimistic on the call that they could get this all done and still be in compliance with the Bonn covenants but it is going to be very tight. Also it should not be a surprise that the negotiations have gotten a lot harder over the last six weeks as credit spreads have really blown out. So they face a very difficult near term restructuring which they will likely get done but their new rates will be very high and they will be left with almost no breathing room on their pond covenants.  This is a real problem which is getting worse by the day.(2) NOI, EBITDA, FFO and cash flow are going to come down dramatically and they are retaining no cash flow. They releasing spreads have been -13% which alone will reduce NOI by 2% in 2019. They will continue to have occupancy headwinds, their operating expenses will continue to increase and since they are on fixed CAM, they can no longer pass any of these increases to their tenants. Put it all together, and NOI should be down at least 4.5% next year (15c hit to FFO).  Interest expense will be increasing just from refinancing their line and term loans (at a 3% incremental rate = 13c on a run rate basis).  Their FFO includes at least 17c of non-cash or non-recurring income (straightline rent, gains on outparcels and capitalized interest to name a few).  Then deduct their run rate repair and maintenance (18c based on your R&M number) and you are at $1.13 / share of cash flow before scheduled principal amortization, capex and the dividend.  Annual debt principal amortization is 23c per share (see page 133 of their last 10K) and the dvd is 30c, leaving them with 60c to fund their redevelopment. As you noted they are doing about 58c of development a year which means that they retain not a dollar of cash flow.  So it’s impossible for them to de-lever without selling encumbered assets (hard to sell malls these days and their malls are highly levered with property level debt, so doing this wouldn’t move the needle much).So, while I thought your analysis to be thoughtful, i think that you have made some mistakes and are not thinking about cash flow correctly. You are also really discounting their problems. (1) CBL generates no cash flow. You focus way too much of FFO which is a BS number that doesn’t come close to resembling the companies earning power or cash flow generation. This will only get worse as it’s unlikely that NOI growth will ever be positive again (1) they are signing short term leases with rents that DECREASE over time vs their initial starting face rates (I can walk you through the math but it’s quite easy to come to that conclusion from the numbers in their supp).  (2) they haven’t had pricing power in years and their section of the mall industry isn’t getting better anytime soon. (3) If they are able to avoid default and issue bonds to replace those coming due over the next eight years, the new rates will lead to an annual cash flow decrease of 35c / share, or $69mm.(2) It will be very hard for them to navigate the next year or two without violating several bond covenants. (3) I didn’t address the Sears problem, but as I have illustrated, they don’t have a dollar to spend on fixing that problem. That will lead to many dark anchors, co-tenancy issues and a much greater deterioration of already almost non-existent earnings. (4) There will be a JCP problem. I don’t think I even need to get into this as they clearly have no way of dealing with it.  There will also be many more smaller store closures over the next several years but they will not have the capital to re-tenant. The writing is been on the wall for this company since they first made the decision to become an unsecured borrower about five years ago. It was always just a matter of time and how bad the environment got.In my very strong opinion, there is nothing they can do to avoid bankruptcy within the next several years. The stock might go up or down a little bit in that timeframe but eventually the bondholders will become the equity.  Given how much debt and preferred equity they have I’m doubtful that they will even be able to do a chapter 11 and this will be a chapter 7 liquidation instead. Feel free to try and do a trade this company for a bounce here and there on a short covering rally, but the stock will eventually be a zero. It’s just a matter of when. It will not happen in 2019 but it will certainly happen by 2023 when their first unsecured notes come due. Maybe they will try to do a prepackaged bankruptcy before then but I honestly don’t think that they are smart enough to do that.I’ve been doing this for a very long time, have done a significant amount of research on this. I’m not trying to talk my own book because nobody on SA can move the market. I just happened to come across this today and I was hoping to be able to give all of you some good advice.  This may be a sub three dollar stock but it can still go down 100% and will. Apologies for any typos. I wrote this on my phone.",

WPG pref. are much safer.  Yield 9.6%,
On the 10/30 quarterly report they reported estimated FFO for 2018 to be in the $1.70 to $1.80 per share.   Based on about 172 million shares outstanding that seems like a lot of annualized FFO to service debt and do re development.  So am I missing something here?

Another mall with a better location was rejuvenated and re-tenanted.  It is surviving.  While this article does a good job of presenting fact based arguments for recommending CBL, an analysis of each property would add greatly.Over the past six months I have sold O and SPG and bought nine other retail REITs offering a lower P/FFO.  CBL-PRE and PEI were the most ""risky"" of these.  KIM and VER received the greatest allocations.   Retail REITs comprise 20% of my portfolio.",
"Owl, Thanks for the article.  I love your work.radmanjeff63, I like the idea of turning the empty JCPenny, Macy's Sears into senior living housing if the zoning permits it of course.  I lived walking distance to a tier 1 mall for 7 years and now that I live in a SFR, I only have my driveway and a sidewalk.   If CBL doesn't have the cash to retrofit the space, I'm sure there will be plenty of senior living partners to joint venture. And in 5-10 years, there will be a massive shortage of senior living facilities in the USA.  I like the idea, but probably a lot of heavy lifting and maybe zoning and permitting make it less feasible.",
"The div cut should have been done 2 yrs ago when the Sears and JCPenney implosion was getting out of hand. Speaking of JCP they are the next mall tenant to start closing more stores and trying to make a go out of it by pushing the online shopping experience. Re-purpose the empty holes in these malls with senior living space .Hell they are the only ones going to the malls in the first place it seems some days thats all you see walking along.Now they don't have to worry about driving and add in an Urgicare and you got it covered for the old folks.How about an actual food/grocery store take a big chunk of the space also? Live,eat,shop go to the movies and have it all and no snow or grass to mow!! Plus the temp stays the same year round! They will need that 60 Mill next year so kiss that div good bye and they will keep paying the prefs until they do a pre pack BK in another year or so if all the magic wands don't turn the millions of sq ft into paying its way. Trade Joes has been trying to buy some of the empty mall space in my NY,PA,NJ area and each time somebody outbids them for the property. CBL has too much debt to survive and to little cash to play with the big guys.",
"I bought back in to CBL today with only 1000 shares @ $2.65. That's it!!! Memo to self: NO MORE CBL or WPG, no matter how alluring they may be.",
"The article is definitely contrarian, thought provoking, and provides a well mapped analytical approach to making the investment case for CBL.  I'm really a fan of your process.",
"Actually, as a commercial real estate broker, it's pretty easy to put a market value on CBL's real estate holdings. Retail capitalization rates are currently in the low 6s, but even if you were to use a 7, their EBITDA (Net Operating Income) at a 7% capitalization rate puts there holdings at just under $8 billion. This gives them an equity position after the preferred (could be viewed the same as a second mortgage) of $2.325B (approximately 29%, a reasonable leverage ratio by commercial real estate lender standards) or $11.66 per share. You could subtract a couple points for sales expense but that's liquidation value. Thank you for providing the impetus to do these calculations, I think I will be buying more.",
Dividend will be cut again in 2019 by at least half.,
"@The Owl:I do think CBL can make a successful turnaround and recovery over time. Right now, at $2.71 the yield is 11%. As there are many less risky stocks at that yield, for me, I prefer to wait for a likely lower CBL price closer to $2, which is a 15% yield- better for the risk.",
"Enjoyed your article on CBL.  I consciously put about 5% of my portfolio in deeply discounted, distressed securities and have, to date, waited on this one.  They always go lower than you think and the turnaround activities take, at a minimum, years.  Very balanced article.  You mentioned FTR in your response to Darren.  Have you thrown in the towel on that one?  Thanks.",
Congrats you must of made a lot of money on cbl :/,
"Financial analysis is essential , But what I find missing on Seeking Alpha is that most analysts ( Owl excepted ) have not visited any CBL malls , nor care to . Most of these malls are quite respectable and most of all : Have incredible potential in the right hands . Management does seem to be doing a good job of re-inventing these malls and has the money to do so . Some analysts just seem to want to paint the worst financial picture to presumably run the stock price down . I strongly believe the upside potential of this valuable real estate more than compensates for any perceived downside risk .",
"Thank you for the analysis. I have a few questions:1) Are there any material differences to the preferred series D and E? I have never bought a preferred stock before, so I don't know what to look for. 2) I know what a cumulative preferred means and I understand that these are both cumulative, is that correct?",
"Congrats to the OWL.   This is pretty good financial analysis work.I mostly agree with view the CBL is a pretty good bet to work its way out of this current bind after being cut to junk bond status and lowering the dividend fairly radically.  Also agree that GAAP BV is probably way too conservative in valuing this company.   CBL’s main risk is getting caught in a liquidity squeeze and being unable to invest in re-purposing closing anchors, such as Sears, as rapidly as the market needs dictate.  So far I have seen no sign of a liquidity squeeze here.  Too many folks crying fire in the theater.And mall space for traditional retail in the USA is way overdone.   Retail boxes have generally been overbuilt.   This doesn’t mean the malls controlled by CBL only have value if rented to the typical apparel and shoe traditional retailers----the re-purposing of malls is proving a different and better outcome.One risk, I don’t think that has been addressed is how do most of the largest tenants of CBL view their landlord.   A qualitative review might conclude a different perspective from typical SA analytical work on CBL----which is invariably quantitative.    If anyone has doubts about it----I suggest inquiring how satisfied the largest tenants are with the management quality of CBL malls under the Lebovitz family?  (This would include L Brands, Signet, Foot Locker, Dick’s etc)   Do any of the quant naysayers about CBL such as Brad T  and Boyd actually have any idea?  Boyd’s work is pure quant stuff and while it is possible to produce a bad enough economic scenario to wipe out CBL common holders----the probability seems very remote.  (Been burned by quants before---seen plenty of blindside in this type of analysis.) CBL appears to be spending sufficient maintenance funds.   The big risk here is if these tenants lose confidence that CBL is going to keep investing  in old malls.    It is worth noting that one of the hottest names in apparel retail is H&M which has some 41 stores in CBL malls.  Two years ago, it had 29.   H&M is a coveted tenant by all mall landlords except perhaps the high end-high price fashion operators.   My observation is that H&M leasing more space from CBL is a very good sign.",
"Very thorough and well written article.  Rather than using book value, you may have tried to start with an NAV based valuation, a rather daunting task at this point.  There has never been so much worldwide capital earmarked and allocated to real estate investment making an outright acquisition an option.  Would a 3rd party pay more than the current debt and preferred outstanding to provide equity investors a return above current share price?  A sum of the pieces analysis would likely provide a nice equity reward. Anyone who comes back and says there is no market for this asset class or any other asset class is mistaken.  3rd party would be patient, not be required to pay a dividend, could redevelop quickly. Second point.  You complemented management for making a difficult decision.  You should have turned it around and questioned why NOT one of the CBL family members has bought any shares!!!  Where is their vote of confidence in their ability to execute this complex redevelopment strategy?  I dont care how many shares they own, they have generated enormous dividend income over the years and should be buying shares back themselves. A first step would be to STOP increasing their compensation and work for free or find some new C-suite executives. While I strongly believe they could reap a meaningful higher equity value in a going-private transaction, are they too conflicted? Too stubborn?   Great article. I just think management is the reason the stock price trades so disproportionate to its asset value.  Fundamentals are very tough, some assets aren’t very good, but the company isn’t facing a near term liquidity problem. Portfolio still generates a great deal of cash flow. It’s only a matter of time before an investor steps in to try to force some changes - will mgmt fight this or welcome this event?",
"c. The valuation more than reflects the negatives, creating a highly asymmetric reward/risk profile, and----------------I disagree. By my valuations the stock is worth around $2.

"""Conversion to a C corp"" analysis ignores the fact that as a REIT CBL avoids paying income tax on taxable income used to fund the preferred dividends, whereas a C corp would have to pay income tax on income used to pay preferred dividends.",
"I understand your reasoning but would suggest a mix of bonds and common rather than preferred and common.  Let's take $4,000 as our assumed investment with your 3:1 ratio.  CBL is very high debt, so if 5 years from now it is well on the road to recovery then the common will be a multibagger (4x or more) vs. 60% capital gain + 50% in dividends for the preferred.  If on the other hand CBL goes BK, both the preferred and common are wiped out with say the bonds recovering 80¢ on the dollar.  The bonds currently trade for 80¢ on the dollar yielding 9%.Unfortunately there's no way to past my matrix in a comment but doing the above I come up with bonds and common outperforming preferred and common when the ""good"" scenario is given a 60% chance or less.  Only when the surety of you being right exceeds 60% does the preferred + common make sense.  Given the risk so far, while I agree there is asymmetric return, I don't think you can assume a ""good"" scenario above 60%.  Furthermore were you to assign equal amounts to the two buckets (instead of 3:1), at no point, even 100% surety the outcome will be good, do preferred + common outperform, bonds + common.I encourage you to make your own matrix, as I know you can, and come up with your own conclusion.",
"It’s dividend has been cut over 50%, but the management’s salary have been kept increasing. It’s not fair for stockholders",
"The Owl,Thanks for a balanced objective LT view of things as a counterbalance to the 100% black paint slapped onto CBL by others.   I like that you pointed out CBL will triage their investment targets for optimum return.  The points that the savings from cutting the distro to 0 would not be that much and that a C-corp conversion would be disruptive are also worth pointing out.Now with all that said, there are some other retail REITs in varying degrees of distress -- to cite a few BRX, KIM, PEI, WPG.   And a HY REIT index ETF or two -- again, citing without recommending, KBWY.   My method is to have modest holdings in most of these.robertlgriffin -- It depends on how one defines ""Long term investor"".  My definition is that the biggest determinant of future profit is a low initial price paid.  CBL is either as insanely cheap as it gets or will bust completely.  I bought numerous stocks at comparably crushed levels in past market dump points.  Some have since died and left this earth.  More than those survived and recovered with quite tasty YOC = yield on cost.",
You would think that cutting the dividend would be a plus for the preferred and yet the D and E shares have each tanked about 9% in the 3 weeks since the announcement and are now yielding almost 13% With the common yielding 11% you have to expect further deterioration in the common until it yields about 15% or more.To even call this stock speculative is being very generous,
"""Now what?"" - Delisting.",
just keep buying more to make up for the lowered divy.,
to me the real issue is whether CBL can SURVIVE areal recession.,
I have to congratulate you for taking on the difficult task of predicting the future rather than the more common task of predicting the past!I do wonder whether CBL can keep the dividend low a year from now. It took 2 large sales at a loss just to cut this much.,
Wait until tax loss selling is over. Under $2 if you need to speculate,
What a train wreck! I bought at $9 toward the earlier part of 2017 and feel fortunate to have gotten out at $6 in early November of the same year. I didn't know it had gone so low. May be worth a flyer for a couple thousand bucks. Long term investors need to stay away.,
Thanks for the article as I am a bottom fisher with a tiny bit of my portfolio and have been following this one.   Just because the malls might be a bit dated is not the reason people quit shopping at Sears.  Sears managed to accomplish that on there own.  If the locations are any good they would be prime for re-dev or sale going forward.  Just my opinion.,
Thanks for your insights,
Great article.. I am a big buyer of both classes of prefs and will continue as they cross 13% yield. I’m thinking the hedge funds are in forced liquidation mode to raise cash as there is not reason for this continued fall (in the prefs),
"Nice article but I really do not get your point on comparing repair and maintenance. It can easily be flipped: despite CBL having notoriously older malls, in poorer conditions than SPG, they can’t spend enough to stem the decline of their fixed capital, while SPG doesn’t have to spend nearly the same due to a much better, newer set of properties...","CBL & Associates Properties: The Dividend Has Been Reduced, Now What?"

Not guilty until proven otherwise...right?,
"We'll see how long PG&E's bailout bump lasts.Since PG&E is already a convicted felon after its negligence that led to incinerating people in their homes in San Bruno, I see no reason to be gentle with them. Condemn them under eminent domain, pay the stockholders what it'sworth after liabilities (nothing); and carve them up, turning them into municipal utilities with elected managers. People are dying. This has to stop. Enough is enough!I've lived all over the US. In areas with municipal utilities, the power is reliable and delivered safely (Omaha, NE and San Antonio, TX). In areas where the distribution and generation is corporate-owned, it is less reliable and safe because the corporations only care about the cost-benefit calculation -- not the impacts on society (Houston, TX and Northern California).",

Reading Cal-fires reports of last years fires all created by PG&E is laughable. My opinion since were in court is an arsonist drove up I-5 and tossed butts out his window. Cal-fire states that of the 24 fires, 16 were created by PG&E? I say prove it. If this goes to court it will be decades before it is settled. Probably all the way to the Supreme Court.

"Costs just get dumped onto power customers. Move along, buy some stock, make some money.Under current law, when the utilities have acted prudently, the utility regulator will allow the companies to pass these liability costs onto ratepayers. However, given we’re talking about billions of dollars, the utilities are going to have to finance these payments and the cost of this financing will be part of the total bill passed onto ratepayers.Under SB 901, when the regulator determines that the utility has been “just and reasonable,” the associated liability costs will once again be passed onto California ratepayers in the form of higher electrical bills. However, securitization will allow these costs to be financed over an extended period of time. In other words, the cost of capital for the utilities will be less and, therefore, the bill passed onto ratepayers will be less.ivn.us/...",

Long NWL,
"I got in a little too soon (around $26), then averaged down as the price fell to the $20 range. I took my medicine and trimmed the position as it continued to fall into the teens. But an an average cost basis now of around $22, I believe NWL to be a good intermediate term hold. The dividend yield makes this a more palatable decision.",
"It seems to me that it's an entirely valid investment strategy to invest in a company with poor real-time fundamentals if:1) The share price has appropriately reflected the poor fundamentals of the company.  Here, I am merely saying that an investor who wants to invest in a company with poor fundamentals (for other reasons...obviously...) is best served by investing in one whose stock price has, in some capacity, depreciated to reflect the loss in value due to said poor fundamentals.2) The fundamentals, although objectively poor, or poor compared to similar companies, are A) Being attended to by leadership, and B) relative to itself are improving (likely as a result of A).Not sure why this thread turned into a pissing match, but two things can be simultaneously true here: Warren Buffet wouldn't touch this dog (e.g. NWL has poor fundamentals) and NWL has taken appropriate steps to right the ship and as such, despite their poor fundamentals, has opportunity to run north.As for ""hope"" - everyone hopes.  Until someone can get every trade right and then scale that over 30 years, there will be hope.  Sure there are varying degrees of hope and there are varying degrees of egos who will admit to being hopeful, but everyone hopes.  Hope isn't an argument though (black Baron's point); however, I think there are tangible and real reasons to be hopeful on NWL and I'd be happy to share those if asked - but I will stop here as my comments go on way too long...sorry.  Main point here is that very few NWL investors (Icahn include) invested because of great fundamentals.  Can we at least find common ground there?  No long took a peek at NWL in January and bought because of the amazing fundamentals haha.  I bought it for the turnaround story - which due to tangible reasons - I believe is in it's infancy stageGood luck to all - regardless of strategy, and, should I not end up commenting again, a Happy Thanksgiving to you all!",
Taylor I can't help but wonder if you even understand why the stock has rallied 20 to 25% in the last month or so it's because they raise guidance when I read your articles I'm always disappointed because they're full of technical analysis which I believe makes no sense and fundamental analysis causes the moves and price changes that are reflected in the technical analysis,
I bought in on 08/06/18 and have been underwater everyday since.  I have to say that ending in the green on a day when most equities got trampled is very impressive.,
"Typical comments from value investors on Taylor's articles.I'll present my argument for why NWL does not look appealing in your native tongue. I see a lot of ""hope"" on this board for the future, but will hope turn these fundamentals?

"I think author’s viewpoint is different than most of the Longs commenting here-and he made it extremely clear who this article was catering to -short term traders. So those of you interested in the next 3-18 months, I would say reading this and then arguing the merits of it on your timeline is disingenuous to author’s work.Author-to an extent, I agree with some of what you’re saying. I am long NwL but found myself thinking exactly what I’m sure you thought- when does the music stop? Anyways here’s my analyses-which, isn’t to dispute yours (we are in different timelines) but merely is intended to add my view to the battle of ideas:Given current market conditions I would say the fact we only slid 1.2 today shows the immense amount of buying pressure there is.  I expect to stay between 21 and 24 until one of the following near/medium term scenarios transpires:Bullish 1: announcement of another asset sale (preferably with better than hoped numbers) will prove to investors again that management is executing well on their turn around plan and will draw fresh positive investor attention to NWL. I anticipate a 2-5% pop on any such news with continued but slow uptrendBullish 2: US and China come to a better than anticipated trade deal (or really just any deal at all) here before the tariff hikes in January. I would anticipate a 4-8% jump depending on how good deal Is with uptrend into earningsBullish 3: no developments in China deal, NWL has another excellent earnings next quarter, if there is earnings surprise I would anticipate this leading to as much as a 15-25% jump, but over the course of a longer period, say the next two quarters. I’d further anticipate that NWL will then, providing they stick to their turn around plan (as they have so far)be a $32-35 stock by Q2 2020.Bearish 1: no deal whatsoever with China, and tariff hikes to 25% in January. Although NWL’s share price already has taken a huge beating over the tariffs leading me to believe a fair amount of that is baked into the price, I’d still anticipate a 7-10% slide. Bearish 2: underwhelming earnings combined with an inability to sell off additional assets. I’d anticipate an initial 4-9% slide and then a downtrend from there into the mid teens.I’m sure there are other scenarios, I just tried to play into the 5 catalysts I believe are most likely to happen and as such impact share price between now and say, March of 2019. In other words, there’s infinity scenarios, but preparing for them is stupid.Finally, in order from most confident to least confident I believe the following will occurAnother asset saleGood earnings No deal whatsoever 25% tariffsDeal with ChinaBad earnings.* I don’t view China issue as purely binary *i don’t view these events as mutually exclusive-draw inferences on your own from a double positive catalyst, double negative, or negative positive",

"ggolly,I suspect the low sales for Q3 medical were due to building up inventory for legalization.  If you look at the numbers you will see quite large increases in kilograms harvested vs. same quarter previous year (265% increase) and inventory (+76%), quite good increases in price per gram sold (+24% due to focus on things other than flower), more modest increases in medical customer registrations (34%) and medical sales (33%), and a relatively low increase volume of kilograms sold (+9%).  So there's a huge build in inventory somewhere in the system.  This is completely consistent with a company strategically building inventory with an eye towards the long term business they want to foster rather than sacrificing that for immediate gain.  Mr. Linton repeatedly said he thought the market would be under-supplied going into legalization (which we now know was correct with multiple out-of-stock situations).  He also indicated a high and ongoing spend educating budtenders (another form of marketing, applies to everywhere except Ontario), and a plan to ensure someone who got Tweed product week 1 and liked it would also be able to get it week 2, 3, 4, .......40......80...120 etc.  Another way to put this rationing, or rationalization of inventory flow to ensure customers won stay won.",
"Also, does anyone know is this is a limited partnership?  or regular company?",
The deal is they have no profit and are burning money trying to get the business started up.  This means no P/E ratio to justify a value of the stock shares so its anyone's game at this point.  It's mere speculation that in the future they will make a profit.. Correct me if I am wrong but basically the stock is relatively worthless and a huge gamble until they become profitable.

"Yet another good article on another key NASH player.""NGM282 is a non-tumorigenic variant of human hormone FGF19. NGM282 works by activating FGFR4 to modulate bile acid synthesis and multiple metabolic pathways.""A couple of questions:Does NGM282 only target FGFR4? But based on the Figure 1, NGM282 also target FGFR1c that has impact on fat.All FGF's (23 of them all together) except FGF 7, 10 and 22 also target FGFR1c and FGFR4. One has to wonder if there are positive effects, how one can differentiate the impact on FGFR4/FGFR1c by NGM282 and other FGF's?One comment:Merck apparently has decided to pass NGM282 and chose NGM313 that targets FGFR1c.One can guess that maybe Merck prefers targeting the receptors, rather than the ligands, similar to what they did in the PD 1 versus PD L1 targeting.",

One of the most stupidest word ever.  Clinical trial?  Weed is bio subsistence can’t be patent! Plus TLRY is not pharma dont even onw a lab.   The company is just a resaler of farmers with branding. The beat easy climate to grow weed is at equaltor and hot. Canada is the number one worst place to grow.  You should exam your brain,

'lies ahead',
Dozens of articles have been published about TLRY here on SA and over at TMF and practically to a one every single article explains that among all the bloated over-valued Canadian pot stocks there is none that can touch Tilray for investor idiocy.I guess there's always got to be someone who figures I'll get attention by going the other way and tell you why a $10B company with microscopic sales and major losses is actually a good deal.,
You do know that Tilray limits its float and has very little shares available for the general public which has helped cause the extreme volatility in that stock and also the gross over valuation of the company.  The original investor’s are also locked out from being able to sell their shares until I believe December of this year.  I’m not positive on the exact date they can start unloading their shares but when they do - I don’t want to be holding that stock.  They are also not even half the company that Canopy or Aurora is.  Their last earnings report was less then impressive as was Canopies.  I’ve been knee deep in these stocks for three years now and I’ve made a lot of money.  I’m very bullish on the industry and think the US will legalize on a Federal level sooner then you think.  As for Tilray...I’d be really careful with that one at least until the original investigators can sell...then I may take a look at them but not now.,
"Tilray is overvalued by almost any more compared to its competitors. The reason the stock is so expensive is more than half its shares are in lockup until January. As to volatility TLRY has traded as high as $300 and IPOed at $16, all within a couple of months.I hold TLRY and plan to get out before January. I'll get back in after lockup and the inevitable downward adjustment.This is a rather shallow analysis.",

"24joseph - that's exactly right.  I was hopeful that Minogue's subtle caution during the quarterly conference call might be heard by the investment community, but it wasn't.  The primary investigators are clearly still optimistic that the endpoints will show the success they presume, but since it isn't obvious right now, the stock took a 30% beating (ouch).  Unfortunately, it may take 18-24 months for that to become obvious to the market.  In the meantime, all we can hope for is continued operational excellence and no further adverse events.  Minogue's gotta be choking on this share price destruction though.",
I believe this may have been beyond the company’s control. The primary investigators thought they had conquered cancer when in fact the results were underwhelming and labeled “exploratory” after the fact. As a clinician I can safely say this technology is truly disruptive without competition for at least 3-5 years with excellent management. The stock will come back. It is an earnings driven story.,

"Happy holidays everyone.I'm doing a bit of math today looking at historical contribution margin and EPS numbers for $SLCA.  I'm just using what I believe to be some conservative estimates below and trying to figure out if the end of the world is actually coming for $SLCA.MAJOR POSITIVES> There is more sand being sold now vs. 2016 and the margins seem to be better and will hold up better, even with awful NWS pricing because of the in-basin balance.> Last-mile logistics with Sandbox helpMAJOR CHALLENGES> Lease rental payments and minimum purchase commitments are approximately 3.75x and 3x higher, respectively in 2019 vs. 2018.  This seems to be a huge drag.> Interest expense due to higher debt load is 3.5x higher vs 2017.  This is a huge drag as well.As of 9/30/18, total liabilities stood at  $1,919,174,000.  Compare this to $799,930,000 at YE 2016.  Assets stood at $3,288,655 as of 9/30/18.  Compare this to $2,073,220,000 at YE 2016.Diluted shares outstanding as of 9/30/18 were 77,859,000 vs. 65,037,000 at YE 2016.  There is approximately $184,000,000 in authorized share repurchases on the table.  At the current share price, that money could retire approximately 18M shares, or an astonishing 23% of the float.Even though total contribution margin in 2019 may be 72% of 2018, higher obligations will eat into everything.  If current market conditions persist, my best case scenario EPS estimate for 2019 rests between $0.50 and $0.63.  My worst case scenario is $0.20.There are many ways to calculate fair value, but if we bracket out a P/E multiple of 15, we could obviously see the share price decline much further from the current $10 today.In summary, it seems like $SLCA is in a much better place now vs. 2016, with a better understanding of the overall business, more contracted volumes, a hugely successful and growing industrial & specialty segment, diversification into logistics and movement to in-basin as a majority of mined proppant.PROPPANT SEGMENT Contribution Margin (pricing decreases; volume stagnant)2014 - $256,137,0002015 - $88,928,0002016 - $11,445,0002017 - $301,972,0002018 - $331,591,000 (ESTIMATE of $303,591,000 through 9/30/18 + $28,000,000 Q4)2019 - $140,000,000 (ESTIMATE based on $14/ton x 10M tons which is 20% lower volume and no margin improvement vs. Q4 '18 estimates)INDUSTRIAL & SPECIALTY SEGMENT Contribution Margin (pricing increases with slight volume increases)2014 - $56,983,0002015 - $61,102,0002016 - $70,137,0002017 - $88,781,0002018 - $140,000,000 (ESTIMATE of $110,528,000 through 9/30/18 + $30,000,000 Q4)2019 - $200,000,000 (ESTIMATE based on Q3 '18 run rate of $48,697,000 and more volume and even better margin going forward)TOTAL CONTRIBUTION MARGIN2014 - $313,120,0002015 - $150,030,0002016 - $81,582,0002017 - $390,753,0002018 - $471,591,000 (ESTIMATE)2019 - $340,000,000 (ESTIMATE)EPS (diluted)2014 - $2.242015 - $0.222016 - ($0.63)2017 - $1.772018 - $1.10 (ESTIMATE)2019 - $0.50 (ESTIMATE)DISCLAIMER: I wrote this comment myself and was only compensated by my intrigue and self-learning.

Many forecasts of CGC seem to view this as a Canadian and slightly US market positioned company with figures to match. Someone correct me if I am off on a limb but I think the cannabis market is in legalization mode globally. If not for medicinal then for recreation and medicinal. CGC among a few others have global positions and a global plan. North America is only a part of the total sales potential. When more countries progress the sales potential also grows. Estimating the complete potential including the swallowing up companies that will falter in the future adding to the total sales potential. What is the outlook when factoring in the whole plan? Seems analysts have prematurely stagnated the growth outlook for several globally positioned Cannabis stocks. FUD seems to be winning at the moment for the entire financial system. I do own some CGC and will keep adding. The 3 and 5 year looks tremendous as they use the war chest to plunder.,

i have nothing against the authors conclusions... just commenting that this has been rehashed numerous times over numerous articles....  no value added here,
WTI has rebounded slightly but is still almost a dollar below $47.30–the line below which 2019 pay outs are ZERO. Could be a disastrous month for the share price.Disclosure: short BPT via long term puts.,
"At tonight’s WTI, BPT will stop payments in Jan 2020 and total payouts will be about $2 on a $25 investment.  If the WTI drops below $47.30 and stays there, BPT’s final pay out will be Jan 2019–less than 3 weeks away and that’s less than WTI has dropped in the last three trading days. Who would have thought it in October when WTI was $75? I didn’t. I would have bought a lot more puts than I did.  If the WTI keeps dropping this week I will hedge my BPT puts with USO calls.

"According to the Wall Street Journal and consulting firm R.S. Energy Group, true breakeven prices that incorporate costs such as land acquisition come out to about $51 per barrel in the Permian, $57 per barrel in the Eagle Ford, and $64 in the Bakken.",
"I am not sure what BPT shares will be worth at termination. (I think about zero, but they are rather cagey). I am sure that 1) the event is more than two years out and 2) the share value at dissolution should be at least $10 (to get the intrinsic value up to half the current share price) if it’s going to influence our current investment decisions. I doubt it could be that high. 3) If one projects the share at dissolution to be, say, $1.00, and if the shares are in the pink sheets at a few cents, then BPT could be a great spectacular buy at that time.  Bottom line: dissolution price should have no effect on decisions now, but close to trust dissolution, fortune may favor the prepared mind.",
"""Did you talk to the trustee""@patricklirish As I said in a prior comment, yes.",
"I have a few observations,  First, I found this article very interesting and not simply another review of the BPT 10K which I hope everyone is familiar with by now.  Much of it does not apply to me personally, since I am invested via my IRA which prohibits margin, but the article does raise a general approach which I will probably try to implement.Second is the general situation of BPT after the oil price debacle of the last few weeks.  We must not forget the basics.WTI tonight is $50.42, a dramatic drop from the $75 of a few weeks ago.The implications for BPT shareholders are equally dramatic.  If the WTI oil price averages at this level going forward:       The Trust will cease making payments in Q1 of 2020--a bit over a year from now.      The 4th quarter this year may pay a dollar.  2019 would see total payout of $0.76--or 19 cents a quarter.         Total return for a buy and hold BPT shareholder would be $1.76--for a loss of 93% on today's close of $25.23.        If oil continues its fall so that it averages  WTI $47.40 (a smaller drop than it suffered just today), the trust stops payments in Q1 2019--about 4 months from now.        Oil could rise and stave off disaster--or not. I don't know what oils will do. At this point, BPT shareholders are staring into the abyss though.         Three: I doubt very much that BPT royalties survive the dissolution of the Trust and so the final value of the trust will be very minimal.  But during the two years between stopping payments and dissolution, shares (or call options if they are traded) could be a very lucrative and cheap gamble on an oil price spike. I will decide on that if and when BPT ceases payments, but it is a speculation that we should all have in the back of our minds. Disclosure: short position via some put options.Have a great holiday weekend!",
"Also Robert, your comment, ""The trust ‘owns’ an oil field in Alaska, and its operator pays a royalty of 16.4% on the first 90,000 barrels of daily crude oil production at WTI "",is interesting because most doomsayers believe that the trust DOES NOT ‘owns’ an oil field in Alaska...'",
"Your analysis is flawed because:'which is why the reserves assume that royalties (thus economic production of oil) cease after 2019 based on the 12-month average WTI price at the time of $51.34 per barrel. In fact, when not counting production, proven reserves doubled in 2017 already due to the increased WTI.' is not true. The trust terminates after 8 consecutive qtrs, or 2 yrs, without paying a dividend, but if it pays a qtrly dividend within that 2 year, the 2 year period starts again,  an so on. Also upon termination,  the trust units will be sold. There is not a reversion clause.",

"Great article, welcome to SA...I have a few things to say as an Upwork freelancer and client. (I also own the stock as of today) Upwork is the only platform where premium freelancers can consistently (freelancers don't want to starve between gigs) get paid what they feel they are worth. ($100/hr, $200/hr, etc). This is the consensus among freelancers.Most other freelance platforms do not have clients willing to pay premium rates. Platforms who have those kinds of clients do not have nearly as many as Upwork. (Toptal, working not working).About those fees...Nobody likes fees and they never will. But it's fair. Furthermore, you suggest freelancers will go outside Upwork with the clients to avoid fees. Yes, many do. However, in the long run both freelancers and clients benefit from staying on Upwork more than if they go outside Upwork.The only way Upwork can become successful is if they bring in more clients. Freelancers go where the clients go. Clients go to the platforms that meet their needs. (Key word is NEEDS) As you said, freelancing is fragmented. That's because there's different kinds of clients. Clients who don't want to pay ""a lot"" of money for services go to Fiverr. Clients who want premium quality freelancers go to Upwork.Upwork's growth, and success, is guaranteed. It's only a matter of time.PS: The copywriter in me cannot resist pointing out the error at the beginning of your article (see the repeat of the editor's note)",Upwork: Exciting IPO With Question Marks

"Did Shell's plan include oil dropping 7% in price and its own shares dropping almost 5% in price in just one day?  I don't care what their plans are/were, this company is worthless in the world where oil prices will continue to fall and they keep finding more oil to drive prices down further.  Eventually, oil will stabilize in the low $40s or in the $30s and it will not longer be economical to keep drilling.  Then, oil will climb to the mid-$40s.  But, Shell as an oil major will never see any appreciation again.  It is finished and its only value will be if it can somehow manage to scrape up enough money to pay its dividend.  That is likely to be cut also as oil falls in the $30s.",

"@The Value Portfolio Hi,Great article, thank you for that. I was wondering if you did try to value the company. And how would you value it today. So how large do you think is the margin of safety if I buy today? Thank you in advance for answering,retire_in_50 (hopefully)",
"Yes, I have called Shell garbage in the past, but only because there will never be any appreciation in its share price that is meaningful in the those 15 years of which you write.  However, I have come to realize that getting 5-6% from bank CDs is a long way off and will, most likely, never occur.  So, the Shell dividend is a good proxy except that it lacks the safety of a CD.  Unfortunately for Shell shareholders, the risk of share price depreciation is far greater than the chance of any appreciation.  I know you don't care if your shares fall in price because you see it as an opportunity to pile up more shares of a company that will likely only fall further as oil prices and earnings plummet as a result.  For your information, some of us don't want any more shares.  We have enough and would like to see them appreciate rather than depreciate.  Yet, I realize there are others, like you, who only want a bunch more shares regardless of how much each is worth.  Somehow, the number of shares you have is more important than the value of those shares.  As said earlier, Shell's success in increasing its production of carbon based energy sources will only help insure that its share price will never increase as the world is inundated with oil and surrounded by natural gas fumes.  I will continue to ""sing my song"" until Shell shuts me up.  Unlike you, I don't believe the share price will ever climb.  Not because it is a bad company.  It is a very good company that does its business well. It is just in an industry that makes it near impossible to have the kind of earnings increases to propel the share price forward.  As you said, it is very stable and that is the unfortunate part.  Too bad it can't get a little unstable and earn some big time money.  But, I will take the dividend; and maybe someday it will get to $65 and If I don't need the dividend any more then, I will be able to sell at a higher price than it is trading for today.  $65 is only a buck and a half more than today's price, but after 8 to 10 years of dividends at $0.94 per share, I may welcome selling out.",
"JS, we’ve heard your song before.Buy backs, increasing revenues via global demand, asset sales, and inflation will drive the stock higher. Just wait until the dividends start rising again. And then their is NG/LNG and Asia. Banks are a long way off from paying 5-6% again, so let RDS sit there. We’re into dividend flow and safety, and when it dips, great, adding more for an effective YOC (Yield on Cost) increase.Many prescient investors (like the corporations they invest in) have no issue with stability and a 15 year time frame. We have been in certain companies for decades, generationally. Exxon comes to mind in the energy sector. Since 1965, and mostly reinvested in its glory days. Frankly my family went from having to tape its carpet in huge strips in our apartment to some blessed comfort across the many years.Garbage?

"Oil prices up today and natural gas down a little, but, of course, RDS.B falls again.  There is no news or developments that can move this share price upward.  Even all the successful projects mentioned in the article will merely contribute to the glut of carbon based energy sources that will result in Shell cutting its own throat by increasing supply and decreasing prices.  I don't care if they are into oil or LNG or pure natural gas, this company's Q3/18 report will be the best traders wlll see in years from Shell.  All this new production will insure that the dividend will be paid, but there will never be any serious price appreciation in the shares.  Maybe $65 on an intraday trade once or twice a year for the next 15 years.  But, collect the dividend and prepare to never see any appreciation with a significant risk of seeing that share price fall while you collect the dividend.",

($150.59/ 62.50)I've been fair in stating that (yes) both stocks have taken their hit in the last 12 months but if anyone can give me an argument that proves that BABA has been the better investment, let's see it!!!!!

"I agree with the others and as I've stated in the past, I think PRO-140 is really quite promising especially for the HIV indication. While it may find success in other areas, if for some reason the HIV combo therapy isn't approved then I probably won't wait around to see the results of the trials in other indications such as cancer. I think if they can get there from a financing standpoint then both combo & monotherapy will be approved.",
Thanks.,
"Yes, both Merck and GILD drugs are below 80%. Another problem is the lower compliance rate in the US of 55% versus the 77% rate in Africa. Pro-140 at 700mg should have been 100% if two of the patients did not boosted their T cells , one with a flu shot and the other had a cold. Mono success is all but guaranteed given the observed relationship between dosage and response. Other than finance uncertainty, the company is very much de-risked compare to a lot of companies out there.",

The company is anticipating the FDA will allow a pivotal monotherapy trial for label expansion for PRO 140.""Not familiar with the HIV space. What are the responders rates of the current SOC, less than 80%? How sustainable for these rates? Also, what are the responders rates for the PRO 140 combinations, less or more than the mono? If the combo is approved first, its efficacy has to be at least on par with the SOC. The mono results may take a long time and its success is not guaranteed.",

While they are relatively in need of funding, I am impressed by their addition of good indications, and being open to merger for growth, using stock equity instead of cash. CytoDyn has a team with a good sense for business development. Perhaps their once a week injectable PRO-140 will be effective against metastasis of prostate cancer too, the primary cancer killer of men. That is a large (and so far unmet) indication since most men go on to die once prostate cancer spreads beyond the prostate.

"This stock is an absolute disaster! When I read the comments of fellow investors who are caught like me holding this stock and are still optimistic, it is difficult to read. I listened to the earnings call and the lame answers to the analyst’s questions, and just became Ill. Not only were the answers lame, but the analysts were lamer with the softball questions they asked of management. Not one asked if the management thought they had any credibility left with investors. This is the third time they have come up with weak reasons for their mismanagement, you do remember? •	3 Quarters Ago - We had a major customer readjust their delivery schedule which caused us to miss out numbers. That customer was Amazon, which switched to another supplier. Someone had inside information at the time, as many were selling the stock short and the stock tanked. Then 10 days later they come out with a press release with the story of the customer adjustments! The stock tanks again. •	2 Quarters Ago - We did not have enough workers in China because of the Chinese New Year! Like the Chinese New Year does not happen every year and any management worth anything should have been prepared for this! This was the reason given for missing that quarter’s numbers, stock tanks!•	Most Recent Quarter - Now they say they had a small percentage of failures with a major customer (Facebook) which caused them to miss their sales forecasts. How does a SMALL percentage of failures result in missing the total forecast shipping numbers by 30-35%!!! The Facebook contract was a letter of intent, no binding obligation. In the electronics industry, this is a joke. I suggest that my fellow investors also read the Black Mumba report that came out a month ago on SA which presents a critical analysis of the situation. It is dead on. At this point I am just plain pissed. We have a stock position that we have little hope of recovery. In case you do not know, there are currently 3-4 law firms preparing to file a class action law suit against AAOI for false and misleading information that have caused investors to buy stock based on the information (Me) and lose money on this stock. The Law Firm names are under SA information.",

I thought the problem at AAOI was with one customer and then only a fraction of the units sold?? Thats what they said when this issue first was announced. The 5G build out will help the optical sector but its probably a year or more away before things really heat up. IF you can wait that long, this might be a good entry point but I would wait until the downtrend stops and a solid base forms before cost averaging in.",

"@author you wrote a nicely positive assessment of INTC, based largely on several variants of what I call ""valuation hokus-pokus"". You saw from feedback here, how believable your numbers are.Only real tangible valuation statement you made, IMHO, was the high (dividend yield + share reduction ""yield"") combined.  whta you failed to address at all, were how strong or weak the factors are, which support revenue grwth and profitability in the future , i.e. the main factors that count. Those of course include the risk factors as well.I happen to believe that the lack of a CEO plays virtually no role, with Murthy being the de-facto COO of the company, and doing a GREAT job at it. A lot of (previous) dead wood is gone in top management circles, so who really needs a CEO? Only people missing one, perhaps, won't speak out due to #MeToo movement stigmatization.And Intel's unfortunate steps taken in 10 nm development, will cease to matter eventually, when the rules change once again for a REAL 7nm process node, not one in name only. I am confident that INTC will be in the forefront of process development again in th e future.The myth of a supposed SC process leader is dead anyway, in this day and age of mightty SC fabs.

"Why do you focus so much on revenue instead of operating income? Isn't income/OIBDAR the more important metric for the stock? Revenue paints a misleading picture because WIN is transitioning from low margin businesses to higher margin businesses. Thus, revenue can flatline or even decline while income increases. That said, I do like your emphasis on FCF. That's the most important metric. FCF has stabilized this year and WIN believes it will grow next year. If they are able to get FCF on a growth path, that would be huge.",

I would switch, but the only alternative is the currently terrible satellite service. Maybe if Spacex launches their service and it has reasonable speeds/costs, we would switch.

With Growth of 17 something, PEG is now below 1. Talk of PG etc trading at 20 PE. And soon we are going to roll into 2019. So Forward PE will not be forward anymore.2. Digital advertising is cheaper than T.V. Scope for room there. More value for the buck as well.3. Rest of the World has more scope for growth. That is not going to straight line anytime soon. And ARPUs there will rise with a growing middle income class. However 2+ billion MAU out of a population of 7.7 billion seems to be a lot.4. Feed is transitioning to Stories. But management seems to think that Stories with be able to monetize at the same level of Feed years from now. So is this just short term pain?5. Whatsapp, IM not monetized yet. I don't know how much Instagram has been monetized yet. Anyone any idea? Oculus and Smart speakers, I don't know how popular they will be.6. Costs as a % of revenue I am sure will come down over time as they utilize more AI. 7. FB will keep inventing. See FB Watch, Dating etc. Maybe some kind of an e-commerce platform also comes up?

"It looks to me the new regulations have something to do with the expensive real-estate in China. RYB and others either have to spend millions to buy the property in the high-class areas or lease it and maybe share the profits. The government wants to be the landlord and at the same time be able to control the fees the kindergartens can charge. I recently asked from a management company why they have a kindergarten that has been ready for 2 years but nobody is using it. No clear answer. I think it is some kind of permit issue where the government is forcing the owner to either charge lower rent from a kindergarten or sell the place to the gov so they can do so. Without the permit, the landlord cannot open the doors.I don't live close to a RYB anymore, but when I talked to them last time couple of months ago they said that a lot of remodeling work has been done in all RYBs, and they have more foreign teachers. All the kindergartens have up to 100 CCTV cameras that are also monitored by the government and the parents can come and take a look at them at any time. The management likes the cameras because it protects them from the parents too. It turns out they have always been in favor of them because the kids can say whatever and people believe them. In many cases, those ""little emperors"" have been so spoiled that they have invented stories to ""punish"" their teachers when they did not get their way as at home.Getting good quality CCTV cameras is not cheap, and they need to pull CAT6 cables everywhere. When I helped my friend to take some furniture to one of the local ""generic"" kindergartens, I noticed they had a CCTV system but it was not good quality and didn't have 2 cameras per room. He said:""I wouldn't bring my kid here, the teachers are not as well trained as in our kindergarten and as you can see the CCTV is not good, who knows what they do. Parents are very sensitive to things like that"".",

Earlier in the cycle, sure ... but we're about to hit an inflection point.And I agree that we're about to see imvexxy revenues go up considerably. While it may or may not be as explosive in terms of growth or initial trajectory as Vagifem ... I believe revenues will go up considerably and consistently and the overall trajectory will likely follow that of Vagifem. I am not aware if they (vagifem and imvexxy) are competing & extremely similar products or not, but if they are I'd expect eventually that one of these products (probably imvexxy) would start to gain market share over the other. Particularly as imvexxy gains traction in the market, I would expect to see it gaining market share over whatever products it is competing with. I think that's probably reasonably likely anyway.P.S.

Shorts are in control until revenue starts coming in all likelihood. Also overhang of insider sales is another ammunition for them.

It's all about the execution and Imvexxy has proven so far they are accomplishing what they said they would. Still early but continued execution and early success of Bijuva combined with the perceived insider selling pressure being over makes 2019 very promising and shorts in an unattractive position.,
Thanks for the article. Every once in a while  a stock comes along that seems to make no sense why the stock is being boughten or sold or shorted. I believe TXMD is such a stock. With three drugs approved this year and sales beginning to explode it make no sense why analysts and investors are maintaining such a huge short position on a stock. I just have to scratch my head and wonder. For those maintaining a long position in TXMD I believe they will be greatly rewarded in 2019.,
"Thank you for your insight. very informative.  i was about to dumped and buy more auph n vktx  But, this article provided me not to ignored the potential of this stock for 2019. I'm buying more today since is still below 5.HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE",
Remember the Funds can't buy TXMD till it trades over $5 for 30+ days. There can be some Tax loss selling. That said TXMD is well positioned for serious growth in 2019 and for investors with patience a substantial reward could be over the horizon.,
"@biologics thank you for this article but please rewrite the portion where you say the company is expecting 12 to $13 per script. those were the figures currently due to coupons and the 90-day window with insurances yes. Once everything is set in place with insurers and so forth the net revenue per per script is significantly higher than that. I don't know the number off the top of my head and have to listen to the presentation and conference call again. but I want to say it was 60% of wac and the wac was in the hundred and $150 range. anyways please look into this and rewrite and rephrase that portion of your article accordingly, as people will see that dollar amount as the amount they expect to make when everything is fully established and that's a terrible margin. thank you",

"The chief problem with this business model is that these companies thought they had to scale quickly.  Had they remained smaller businesses in a handful of large markets, they would have economies of scale.   By attempting to go nationwide, they serve many markets where they lose money on every sale.   As far as an industry's viability is concerned, until the industry has been through one recession, it remains unproven.   These guys are failing in good times.

"Great analysis.  One thing worth mentioning in the numbers projection is how well Southwest will fare compared to it's peers after this current business cycle.

Because of this I believe their stable ROIC to be higher than 10% in the long run.",

"I'd say most airlines are a buy at their current levels, especially as a hedge to lowering oil prices as someone who holds some oil and oil-related equities.I'm long multiple of them and will remain long likely for decades, as I expect electric vehicles will reign in during these next few decades and with that comes lower oil prices, and with that comes higher margins for planes. There's other reasons, including general valuation, but there's some macro factors like the above I expect to come into play as well.",

what is your view on ALK as a long term investment?  Is investing in ALK dead money? Thanks,
"I once invested in Southwest, but I no longer fly except when necessary. I don't think that the current growth in jet flights is sustainable from an environmental impact perspective. The new NextGen FAA flight paths are EXTREMELY low and create both noise and pollution over communities that were not previously impacted by Southwest flights- as far out as 10 miles and even in some communities 25 miles. The flights 10 miles from BWI are at 1000-1500 feet altitude arriving, and under 6,000 feet departing. This causes noise pollution on the order of 65-70 decibels over 100 times per day in communities that were previously not impacted, and a large increase in ultrafine particle emissions in the arrival overflight paths. While FAA has greenwashed this impact for the airline industry for the time being, it will eventually be dealt with by congress, and if not, through the Supreme Court. Arizona sued the FAA and won, and other communities are considering legal action, including Maryland which sued the FAA and said that they will go to the Supreme Court if necessary to protect residents. There were over 83,000 noise complaints to BWI in the past two months alone, up from just hundreds before the NextGen flight paths. Now we all know that these low altitude direct paths are saving billions for Southwest and other airlines (and I'm not financial expert but I guess this would make their books look pretty good). When reckoning time comes and they have to go back to more reasonable flight paths, fuel costs will go up. Southwest is still great compared to other airlines and I'm sure that they will still make a profit. But it just might not be as much as they are making now at the expense of millions of victims who live around major large airports, who are impacted by FAA's NextGen environmental disaster. I just thought that you should know too, if you are supporting this industry, it is like supporting the cigarette industry. Some people don't have a problem with it, but I know that there are many people who would rather put their money somewhere that it is not going to be part of harming others unnecessarily.",
Great write up,
"Mr.Barnett,Wonderful article!  As a long time Southwest investor I share your feeling the the company is intrinsically worth a higher price.  One of the many reasons I feel so optimistic is the ripening of their ""international"" strategy which has the promise of raising their RevASM significantly over time.  (I used quotes above because I include their upcoming opening of flights to Hawaii in that strategy.)",
Delta seems more plausible since Berkshire in their latest 13f filing trimmed its stake in LUV but added to Delta,
"Southwest finally dug out of its ole for early retirement of 737 classics last fall and is now about 3%.ahead of last fall in number of planes.Southwest announced a focus on international expansion, but in its most recent adds, has a lot of domestic added/increased routes.  Predictably, some routes are between existing focus cities with no competition: Nashville-Burbank, Nashville-San Jose. Then they are building their presence in Nashville with non stop routes, Nashville-Norfolk, Nashville-Omaha and Nashville-Seattle and increased frequencies to Boston, Detroit; Las Vegas, Minneapolis/St. Paul, San Diego, St. Louis.  Other routes announced include San Diego-Omaha, San Francisco-Ontario, Austin, Texas-Raleigh/Durham,  After all the international talk, Southwest is only adding Baltimore/Washington-Grand Cayman and Houston Hobby-Punta Cana.Competitively, Southwest's new/expanded routes go against more existing Delta routes:Delta - BNA-BOS, BNA-MSP, BNA-SEA, BNA-DTW, AUS-RDUAmerican - BNA-LASAlaska - BNA-SEA, BNA-SAN,JetBlue - BNA-BOS,United - SFO-ONT, Houston-Punta CanaFrontier - AUS-RDUIncreased Nashville frequenciesBoston (Delta, JetBlue)); Detroit (Delta); Las Vegas (American); Minneapolis/St. Paul (Delta); San Diego (Alaska); St. Louis (4, up from 3).",

A buyout target for W Buffet ?,Southwest Airlines: Intrinsically Cheap But Is Now The Time To Buy?
"As I write this, diesel is $1.01 more than regular unleaded at a nearby Pilot Travel Center. I can remember the day, not so long ago, when diesel was always cheaper than regular.  Seems as though the refiners may be milking their cash cow and if this is the case, Knight-Swift as well as all trucking firms, will not see any relief in their fuel costs anytime soon. Actually, even if the refiners are not keeping diesel prices artificially high, the differential is still damaging the industry and pushing it toward electrification.Electrification, something I am all in favor of, not that it matters, means huge investment by the industry, Knight-Swift included assuming it wants to be ahead of the curve to help ensure the merger works.  Electrification also means massive write-downs of existing assets - unless E&Y is the CPA firm.As another commenter mentioned, shortage of drivers is a serious issue. The problem is so acute in fact the industry is looking at and in some places has already deployed, autonomous tractors. I'm also in favor of autonomous tractors, not that it matters, but like electrification, the transition will be long, fraught peril (expense, regulation, liability), and resisted by driver unions.Then there is Jeff Bezos.  Since Amazon has already entered the air freight business, what's keeping it from becoming a competitor, probably electrified and autonomous, to Knight-Swift?",

Well, there are around 3,300 to 6,000 new cases in the United States per year. . . .Still, with a similar price to regorafenib (around $17,000 per month), the company could possibly have a ceiling sales figure of $56 million per month, which would require treating 3,300 patients per month.""If there are 3300 - 6000 new cases per year, that would be 3300 - 6000 patients per YEAR, not month, right? If they treated 3300 per month Y/Y, that would be 37, 000 cases per year.",
Zach in your report you mention approx 3000/5000 GIST patients and already 2 drugs are available and Blueprint is way off before they have any possible FDA approval The thing I want to mention is that they are not going to get 3000 patients to use this drug so your estimate of + 50 million sales figure is inaccurate,

"The big problem for Amazon is that to subscribe to Prime you need to go to the Amazon India site, which is only in English and, as of September 2018, Hindi, regardless of what local-language content it may offer (which is very little right now, be it video, books, etc).Only the minority English-speakers (10% of the population) will be heading to Amazon to shop on a regular basis. Hindi speakers may start to gravitate to the site now, but Amazon dismissed local languages for so long it may well pay the price now.In any case Amazon simply doesn't have enough local language content to make Prime worth the money. Most of the Amazon subscribers will be getting Amazon Video as a bonus, not as the reason to sign up. The numbers cited are Amazon Prime subscribers who happen to have access to video.If we adopted this nonsensical measuring tactic in the US Amazon would be the biggest video player in the States.",

"Well, I don’t agree, and it is hard to follow anyone when they blatantly botch a simple quote that they acknowledge is well known, “the quote the author was trying to quote was Warren Buffett famously says that investors should be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.”  Instead he says wrongly that Buffett says be greedy when others are greedy, which is absurd and utterly the opposite that Buffett is trying to communicate.   Simple fact is price paid determines risk taken and future return.  Thus Buffett likes to say, “you pay a mighty high price to invest in a rosy environment.”  So as a value investor the FANG stocks are highly coveted for their great fundamentals, but shunned for their high prices by greedy eager investors that don’t understand that price paid is still important even on great incredible companies.  Facebook has issues, every great opportunity has issues and it is why there is an opportunity and I for one will be scaling into this one and if I am early and it continues to decline I will continue buying as long as I see the company maintaining its user base.  Buffett likes to say and I practice stocks and the stock market are not here to guide you, but to serve you.  Don’t look at the stock price to tell you what to do.  Keep your eye on the company and what they are doing to guide you.  Zuckerberg for anyone that knows Facebook, knows they guy stole the idea.  He is smart but greedy and ethically challenged in my opinion.  Thus, if regulators came in or politicians look to discipline him the SEC could be their answer and Facebook would absolutely pop up in value if its two share class structure were reverted to an all one share class structure.  Zuckerberg should go enjoy his mountain of wealth and leave the company for others to run.  He does after all need to buy his way into heaven and needs to get cracking ASAP,.

It's a pile of garbage that I'll never use, but I as much as I wish it was dead, much like smoking despite me owning tobacco companies such as $BTI, and fracking despite me owning oil/fracking companies such as $HCLP it just isn't dying. Google and Facebook are plagues on the planet and are nightmarish, but I own both of them because quite frankly nightmarish behavior dominates in capitalism so they will dominate and continue to do so. Almost everyone but freaks like myself still use facebook, even college students, and the ones who don't are all over instagram. Their moat, the data-collection terror that they do, will never be trumped. They will continue to own social media and there's essentially no chance of them being replaced, especially as regulation ramps. Smaller companies will never be able to compete with them, if they even could in the last few years which is clear in my view that they could not.Instagram? Nobody and I mean nobody seems to not have a use-case for it. How will they monetize it? It may be difficult, but if wechat and other platforms can be I'm sure they'll manage here. There's so many possibilities with how many brands are advertising and shilling their products on there, the targeting and long-lasting grabbing of viewers is exceptional, it's only a matter of time before smaller companies start using it to gain followers rather than paying for other brand accounts and influencers to shill them. Even if they don't manage and they're incompetent the data-collection instagram gives is absolutely phenomenal, especially because of how careless people are with the data on instagram and how invasive it is in nature. Facebook people think of privacy, instagram they simply do not. I see Google, as well as Facebook, as arguably the most despicable companies that had the largest negative impact on the world, particularly the western world, especially America, and I fully agree with the video you posted. The thing is social media shares the same similarities with video games and all the other damaging things in modern society, and it's not as simple as people realizing social media makes them unhappy and not using it anymore.The vast majority of folks are addicted to it and more-so have their entire world and especially social view based around it. The culture it's instilled and the isolation it causes isn't going away anytime soon and because of this people will continue to grasp back onto other platforms and obsess about them. Gone are the days of teens after school just being genuine human beings are having fun outside. Gone are the days of parents actually being present with their children. Gone are the days of adults talking and helpers strangers in public. These problems will continue to get worse because there's functionally no way to change this degradation of society aside from a huge shift in social situations, which can generally only be accomplished through a drastic shift in goals, which in modern society would mean a world war, alien contact, or something absurdly awful like a biological weapon being released. I say this as a younger guy who's isolated mostly due to this social media nonsense as my peers, those younger and older than me as well, are all caught up in this nonsense. The only folks who aren't are farmers, extremists (antifa), or homeless or borderline homeless individuals, and recently immigrated folks who barely speak English. Oh, and absolute dirty hippies, and I say that as a dirty hippie.I'm long $FB because undoubtedly western culture is consumed by social media and there's no escaping it. The problems it has caused aren't going to go away anytime soon. The problems gaming has caused will only get worse. Isolation and a lack of human connection will only get worse.I hope $FB and $GOOGL and $HCLP and $BTI, all of those wretched companies go directly to 0, because they're plagues on this earth, but I know that unfortunately that won't be happening. Fracking will only increase from here. Smoking will not go away, and my mother will die from her smoking, as will millions more because they don't care to quit. I know youtube will not be replaced and people will still use google from here on out, especially because everyone, even myself, use google analytics and give them all the data in the world. I know facebook will continue to haunt the lives of huge swarfs of society and very few people will ever escape from the grasp of social media and technology.I'm long $FB because of macro reasons, not fundamentals.",

Only to see the shares drop over 7 percent today.  When is someone going to report on the CNBC and SNAP conflict of interest?  Maybe the SEC and DOJ should investigate that.

"None of their other products generate meaningful revenue nor do they have high user adoption.

"It seems very illogical to me setting an absolute purchase price target on a stock like Apple and not buying it when it gets close, especially if your intent is to be a long term investor in the company.  For instance, a number of investors have set an entry point of 185 and the stock is at 193 after having reached 188.  185 to 188 is three ponts. In purchasing 100 shares 3 points represent  300 dollars on a purchase of 19,000 dollars.  This is insignificant for a stock you believe will rise a lot higher over time.And if the stock does not reach your target by a small amount, what are you willing tp pay up to in order to own a stock that you ultimately expect to reach a lot higher..I am just like everyone else in setting a price target I would like to own a particular stock at.  It often never reaches my hoped for price while coming close on several occasions in a short period of time.  I then have to bite the bullet and pay what is a little higher price for what I expect will be a significant gain.  If I am wrong on how low the price falls I may buy more if I am comfortable with my long range projection or not or take my loss.  Reality is I do not care if I bought Apple at 185 or 188 if I think it will rise to 250 or more.",
"Apple earnings and cash flow have increased at about 10% a year over the last 5 years. Apple stock, over the same time period, has gone up 161% which is about 21%/year. In the long run, stock prices should not rise faster than earnings growth. Even if earnings continue to grow at 10%/year, you cannot expect the stock price to grow at 20+%. My guess is that earnings will continue to grow at or near the 10% rate over the next 5 years, but I don't expect the stock price to grow at 21%. More likely, it will grow at about the same rate as earnings, around 10%. With the 1.5% dividend on top of that, still not a bad return.",

Pls let it go below 185,
"Apple is very unlikely to fall below 190.  The profit-taking has slowed down and big organizations including Apple and Berkshire Hathaway are buying up millions of shares as fast as they become available.  In other words, this is the lowest prices for Apple shares that we are likely to see in the coming year.  More important, there are three unprecedented opportunities for significant upticks in AAPL share prices in the coming three quarters.  First, an announcement by the Trump administration of a truce in the trade war between China and the U.S. should spur a large jump in the stock market and particularly AAPL.  Both sides are hurting and the two regimes are getting worried as GDP’s are trending downward and businesses are placing enormous pressure on the leadership to stop the tariffs, especially if they are accomplishing nothing.  With the GOP losing control of the House of Representatives and the declining popularity of Trump, there are few things he can do to improve his popularity more than to announce a face-saving deal that would de-escalate the tariff tit for tat.  Second, Apple is likely to announce a blowout Q1’19 quarter.  There is enormous pent up demand from people holding old iPhones, iPads, and Macs, looking to buy upgrades.  In China, over 100 million people bought iPhone 6’s in 2015 and held off buying iPhones in 2016 and 2017.  It is no fluke that Apple iPhones is outselling all other smartphones in China this quarter.  Likewise, iPad sales are taking off.  For the first time in many years, iPads are offering significantly greater capabilities for lower prices.  The 2018 base iPads are faster, have better screens, and are Pencil-capable for only $350, while the new iPad Pros are faster than 90% of laptops.  Ohio State University is buying iPads this year for all its 60,000 students and other universities and medical centers are following suit for their students, faculty, and staff.  The Watch 4 is no longer just an extension of the iPhone but has become a standalone cellular health monitoring device. For the first time in a decade, iMacs and MacBooks have become significantly better and people are upgrading.  These will add up to double-digit increases of Apple revenues and profit this coming quarter.Third, Apple will likely announce new products in February 2019, including probably AR-capable glasses (iSight?), second generation Airpods (perhaps hearing aid capable), and a new upgradable Mac Pro that will be the fastest desktop Mac ever.  In the meantime, people will be constructing computers out of stacked Mac-Minis.  At $1000 per compact aluminum box containing an i5 quad core CPU running at 3.6 GHz with 8Gb RAM, 128 Gb SSD, communicating via T2 controller encrypted Thunderbolt and GHz Ethernet ports, a stack of 10 Mac Minis will provide battle-ready super computer performance for any task.  Each of these announcements should drive Apple shares higher.Apple is doing what they should be doing, executing on their plans.  In the past year, they have significantly upgraded their main product lines (iPhone XRS&M, a base iPad and 2 iPad Pros, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini), added a brand new product line (HomePod), upgraded and monetized services to the 1.2 billion users, regained their dominance of the music market (60 million paid subscribers to Apple Music), and engendered greater loyalty to their products and services than any other company.  They have carefully husbanded their investments in research and development for new products (AI-glasses, CarPlay, Apple Car, and video content development).  They are successfully navigating the treacherous political landscape and gaining market share in China, the only U.S. company to do so in the largest internet market in the world.  Finally, they have steered clear of controversies and mismanagement issues that have plagued some of their peers, including Facebook’s current downward spiral due to their failures to protect their customer privacy and Google’s mismanagement of gender issues.",

I bought Apple 15 years ago. I’ve watched it go up and I watched it go down severely as well. Right now I own a bunch of it and have watched it go down from 233 to where were at now. Yes it is painful but if I’m going to have confidence in the company Apple is the company that I’m going to have confidence in.The reality is They have the best products that are fun to use and that really deal with every day life. I love my new Apple Watch and I have an iPad Pro as well three IMACs... i’m also on my fourth iPhone. Why I say this is because Apple is a commitment as an investor. I realize I bought this and it is basically almost a lifetime commitment. I’m not a kid anymore and when it hits 300 hopefully one day next in the not-too-distant future I will then think about selling some and spending some time on the Costa Del sole enjoying myself and what Apple brought  to me,

"Arguments over AAPL’s valuation aside the main threat to the stock is its broad inclusion in ETFs. When the next bear market arrives people may not want to sell the stock specifically but they will put severe downward pressure on it when they sell their ETFs.

The number of passive vehicles in existence today versus the GFC is orders of magnitude higher and AAPL is one of these most widely represented stocks in these vehicles, the irony being that AAPL could be one of the worst performing stocks in a major drawdown.",

"Damon, allow me to disagree with your analysis. Absent going through all the detail, let's take a look at the forward EPS numbers given by management. They are projecting $3,66 eps for 2019. A solid industrial firm should be valued around 15-16 times earnings or $55 to $58.50 a share. At today's price slightly above $69, EMR is 20% overvalued. Of course, you can own it at this price, but this will depress long term total returns. The last three years have dividend increases around 1% a year. EMR is getting the dividend payout ratio down by simply not increasing it and they do not have a plan to ""aggressively increase it"" as you state. In conclusion, EMR is stable, with limited upside the next few years, and overvalued today. I own EMR at a cost under $49 a share. As I mage my holding to increase the dividend payout each year, I am considering selling EMR (monetizing my unrealized gain) and redeploying the funds into a stronger dividend grower. Cheers",

"I personally think that everyone is being too conservative on the water side. I'm happy with 25X to FCF, for the water side of the business, because:1) It is growing, fast. There should be no argument here.2) There is sustainable demand, those companies which need water need it transported locally, otherwise, transporting water can cost-prohibitive. 3) Several of the companies you highlight in your table have strong cash flows from operations but have heavy CapEx needs too. Ultimately, many of them have no free cash flow or very little. With Intrepid, CFO literally falls into FCF (for the water business)4) Intrepid's balance sheet is a lot cleaner than many of the companies which are listed.Ultimately, I think it is worth 25X to free cash flow. Having said that, I've been wrong before and will be wrong again. But these are my thoughts.",
"I think you're right to be at least a bit skeptical of the long term prospects of the water business. I guess in my mind the value-add has been to provide short-term liquidity until the potash pricing improves. If water income stops in even 3 years, but potash pricing is closer to historical levels, business would still be worth a good bit more than today",
"I am optimistic on the prospects of the water business and I think that the segment has the potential to double in the next 12/18 months. A multiple of 20x sounds aggressive but for sure I wouldn’t use 5x neither. I am also very optimistic on the prospects of the oil business. The demand of oil will continue to rise for a couple of decades at least. I am also cool with the Potash, however it has a limit: the agriculture commodities prices are not great. Inflation will pick up in the next decade to deflate a world with too much debt, and this is a good hedge to inflation. My only concern or question is how the change of government from Republican to Democrats in New Mexico will impact the rules and regulations of the water business?",
What's great is that the water contract at nearly $4M per quarter covers most of the SG&A. The large improvements in potash pricing will show up nicely on the bottom line and in terms of cash flows.,
Thanks for the article. A higher multiple may be appropriate for a growing business if applied to trailing cash flows. IPI is using 1/3 of water rights. The growth constraint right now is primarily getting government approvals to sell the waters because there is a backlog of requests and challenges building up and also the regulators have to learn about the dynamic movement of the O&G firms' need for water vs a more stable (in terms of geography) say agricultural use of water.,
"Great article! Im a little bit upset that I didnt myself read into enough detail on the financials to discover that potentially major contingency. I find your reasoning in valuation of the water business sound. For purposes of actually attempting to buy a bargain (which to me is required if im going to invest in stock of a 500mil cyclical commodity company at potentially a peak in the economic cycle), 150-200m valuation of that segment sounds appropriate.so the question remains... Is it worth paying another 300mil for the legacy business?My viewpoint is that unless your target timeframe is atleast 10 years... probably not. IPI has made me a lot of money in the past 3 years, even though ive been in and out of the stock 5-6 times.

I believe Google China and Facebook China follow the trade deal. BIDU is risky.,
"The problem with all Chinese Equities is that China is a closed economy; they don't allow cash or capital to leave the country. Their balance of payments is close to zero with the threat of getting worse if the trade war increases, and they need dollars. If a stock is worth the present value of it's future cashflows, and China does not allow for cash to leave any of these companies, the companies are uninvestable. For Baidu, Google spends 5 times more in R&D than Baidu makes in profit in a year. Googles product is superior and has a superior brand to Baidus even within China. The trade war will eventually have to resolve itself, at which point, Google will probably be allowed in China. If we look at a scenario where Baidu has a much lower chinese market share and account for the fact that China doesn't allow cash to leave the country, it's hard to value the stock.I say this as a buyer in the 230 and a seller in the 200's when my investment thesis migrated to this one.",
"I only agree partially. It's a highly profitable business with a large market share. People are simply used to Baidu and will not be easy persuaded to switch to a different provider (economic moat).The problem is that the margins are falling, as the company is trying to diversify its bets.

"Wow, pretty embarrassing that a Bret Jensen sponsored forum would push a worthless equity like RESN.  Did you guys do any real DD, or did you just get paid for this shill piece?  RESN is a pump scheme just like CLIR, WATT, etc.  Same team that pumped WATT.  MDB Capital helps it go public. Same SA writers pump the stock. Same results.  4.5 years since the IPO.  No revenue (this is not a trial stage biotech, this is a tech firm making a filter for goodness sake!).  Stock was crushed in 2015 after company had to announce that it's only customer (supposedly Skyworks) had rejected it's design and was severing their relationship (never confirmed by Skyworks btw).  Since then, still no revenues, no customers, nothing but a steady stream of PR pieces suggesting new design wins and new product samplings, all with unnamed customers signing agreements at undisclosed terms, with revenue just around the corner since 2015.  Brought on an ex-WATT sales guy as CEO in 2016 (much better PR stream lol).  Only analysts that cover the name are those that have lead equity raises (Needham, National Securities, etc).  Classic sell-side payola.  Check out the pumper SA articles in 2014/15 (the next Skyworks lol!).  Or maybe the infamous ""teardowns"" in 2017 and 2018 claiming RESN filters were in Samsung phones (really? where's the revenue?).  I could go on and on.

"Thanks for the article, informative as always.   It is good to see the A330 sales especially, but I always keep track of the A350 and another month with no A350 orders has to be a concern,  It was a weak month for Boeing and they still managed an old version 777 and 6 787s.  (OK the 18 A330s probably compensate, but the A350 both in terms of production and sales, does bother me a bit).  Probably the most telling  part (and best part for Airbus) was the upgrade of the 125 planes to A321s.  It is a segment owned by Airbus at the moment, and it seems that Boeing is stuck in a bad place with making a new plane for the segment, as it necessarily will also rob some sales from the 787 to a model that will have to have a lower profit margin.  (Although I have been an advocate of the '797', I am no longer sure, as the 787 is pulling in lots of cash, based mostly on your reports, and they still can sell all the 737s that they can make, with very limited development costs.  Not sure spending 10 billion to rock the boat and take away Airbus's one area of dominance would be a sound business move or be an Airbus-ish pride move)One last thing.

"Just now saw first television commerical on TNT. 7:55 CST, 20181118.",
"I don't think BO will happen after FDA approval of sNDA for Vascepa. IMHO it will happen before that. The first serious bidder with reasonable price offer for AMRN will get the highly valuable prize before FDA decision or even before FDA submission. It will be competition among BPs with cash cows & who realize the market potential of Vascepa. Concern about approval of sNDA is no longer an issue after ANCHOR & RIT trials. So no reason to wait if there is competition. The big question is will the sNDA be broader than initially requested for indication of Vascepa (any patient with trig>150 plus 1 cardiovascular risk factor, with or without statin). This market will definitely be much, much bigger.",
"As a practicing board certified internist with 30 plus years of experience, I suspect that Vascepa will be increasingly and routinely added to most statin using patients or statin intolerant patients to further lower CV risk. Would also be very surprised if Amarin is not shortly bought out by big Pharma and combined with any of the current statins which incidentally are now all generic. This is a no brainer IMO.",
"The $10B question is whether insurance will cover Vascepa in off-label application.  Some have claimed that their prescriptions were submitted with the NEJM article and that led to off label approval (or the study/article was submitted after denial and it was subsequently approved).  I've also read where someone with Express Scripts was denied off label coverage.  This will be very important to follow.  If ultimately most insurers decide to accept the study as validation and cover Vascepa for off-label application, then the sNDA may well become moot and the FDA uncertainty will be a non-issue.  Now THAT would be something!",
"Possible mechanism: EPA intercolates into the small dense LDL monolayer, inhibiting free radical propagation, and subsequent oxidized small dense LDL. Oxidized small dense LDL can’t be taken up by the LDL receptors in the liver and is taken up by scavenger pathways on blood vessels setting off inflammatory cascades and subsequent plaque formation. EPA is just the right size to fit. DHA cannot. Vascepa is 96 to 98 percent EPA.   Omega 3 ethyl esters have EPA and DHA. DHA can’t fit in the lipid monolayer. Also with DHA you get a bump in LDL and EPA you don’t.",

"The Adcom panel was composed entirely of cardiologist, and each of the members had 10-12 grants supported by BP.  AMRN presenters received a rude reception on the part of some Adcom members.  The moderator held out until the very end of the meeting to bring the up, entirely out of the blue, of mineral oil possibility affecting the the Anchor trial results. A PubMed literature search using keywords ""mineral oil"" and "" LDL-C"" and various permutations yielded no reports, none whatsoever, of an association with this long-used compound and LDL-C.  That is, the entire worldwide medical literature. IMO, the concept was an entirely fictitious creation of the moderator, and allowed a touche moment for her in front of her male colleagues.The FDA then used this bogus theory to require a 3-year follow-up outcome study, this  intended to be cost prohibitive  a small cap. AMRN survived. That same week, a NEJM editorial by one of the Adcom members regarding recent approval of PCSK-9 inhibitors stated specifically that they would not require the follow-up study. This in spite of the fact that that class had known adverse side effects, some serious.Based on the description of some possible side effects of mineral oil placebo described, specifically, (put delicately) leakage, one might have expected a higher dropout rate of the placebo patients, but don't know if this was reported.Clearly, BP did not want this large market drug approved for a small cap biopharma with no BP big brother to protect it. The FDA dances to BP's tune.",
Whether this drug makes it or not is up to the Medical Community!  Hoping it does get used is not just greedy but insane.  Medical professionals have the ability to judge data and determine whether any pharma product benefits the patient long term. Investors are very emotional not rational in most cases.,
"Great article, but I wonder the long term effects of using headlines like these that grab attention, but without reading the article it comes off as negative for Amarin. This flood of stories putting into doubt the trial outcome will likely affect patient care, so I urge responsibility. Potential patients will see a wall of negativity when they search for this lifesaving drug. While this plays into the hands of BP, people could literally die from the misleading headlines and news surrounding Vascepa.",

They view this old, recycled news as another opportunity to trash the drug and the stock.

Amarin has indicated all along that Vascepa has been positively impacting other inflammatory markers  for CV disease, in addition to the TG effect.  So yes, there are other positive benefits from the drug.",

If true, just like with Sunrun and their philanthropic endeavors helping with low-end installations in CA, expect to see *certain* hedge funds supporting the stock.In my view, the real fuel that will take all of solar through the finish line is going to be the ABS market. Juts like financing exploded in the housing market in the last 2 decades through PLMBS -which ended badly in 08- we are seeing the first few strong indications that ABS players are liking the securitization of solar loans, mostly if not all residential installations, with high grading by Moodys in spite of their short history. This will instill confidence in institutional players wanting to lay down big dollars for long periods of time on safe, fixed-interest securities. These solar loans are somewhat equivalent to mortgages but of shorter duration and for smaller amounts. Sunpower, Sunrun and Vivint have collateralized a very large amount of loans this year, much more than Dividend and other financing-only outlets.  This financial fuel will push the entire market to grow residential installations quickly.

"An interesting technical question maybe someone can answer. For grid tied systems which require the 240v sinewave from the grid to operate, once all inverters are fully synced and operating, how does an inverter know if the grid goes down? The AC sinewave produced by the other synced up inverters should look identical to the grid sinewave to each inverter. So how does any inverter know if the grid goes down?",

Sorry hate typing on my phone fat fingers.John boy you have a fair chance to be correct the big savings on installation is to do this yourself.That is exactly what I found in the years prior to buying my own equipment and doing this job myself and saving the labor cost in 2015 when I installed my system best guess now I am looking at a seven year payback.I suspect that is way shorter now as equipment prices have dropped and efficiency of panels and wattage has gone up ie less equipment to purchase.Do not be intimidated you can do this.I have tried to run Manvel Maverick Solar as a support company for homeowners to go thru the process and install equipment their selves.I think of this like so many companies that advertise Build it your self for your own home ie will guide you thru the process sell equipment between wholesale and retail and support construction superintendent.Best Regards Manvel Maverick Solar,

"As a serious Enphase long, (one of my biggest positions) I greatly appreciate the research and effort that went into this excellent article, I understand better now that the shorts, who are typically very smart money, are placing big bets on the component shortages continuing to hamstring Enphase's growth and profit prospects. They see no need to cover until well into 2019. But it is clear to me from all of the reading I have done that their new tech behind the IQ7 and IQ8 could really be game changers in a huge way, which includes their incredible reliability and their ever decreasing costs as they use less and less parts in each generation. And they have done millions of hours of field testing as well. That's why they can offer a 25 year warranty.The margins on the IQ8 should continue to get better.So now it's a waiting game to see if Badri's efforts to find better suppliers and build new lines in Mexico will all happen in time. I have no doubt already that the demand is there and will explode next year with the IQ8 is out, it's all about supply.As an investor, I really appreciate how this tech could really make the world a better place for millions. I am convinced that it will lead to an energy revolution, not just in the US but in many developing nations without grids. If they can meet demand next year, the profits will follow.",

Grok - very nice comment.,
"Hi Fuzzy Panda,Thought your article was a useful contrarian view on SSTI. When I own a stock, I always read the contrarian analyses to see if I missed crucial factors. But there are some perspectives that I thought detracted from your thesis. One perspective is your conclusion depends to a large degree on SSTI's technology being static (eg the performance of shot detection in April of 2016 is roughly the same as today). But the reality is SSTI appears to have come a long ways in improving their speed and accuracy. By way of example, in their Investor's Day Presentation they describe the implementation of an ‘ensemble classifier’ including a Resnet convolutional neural network image classifier and an improved Naïve Bayes probabilistic classifier. From the verbal portion of the presentation that sounded like a material improvement in the technology, particularly with helicopter noise. They also state their classification accuracy improved by more than 30%.SSTI's technology has improved from better sensors and sensor placement, and especially from better AI based shot sound analysis. When deploying to new cities,they do test firing of various types of guns in multiple locations to test the accuracy of the shot detection.They also have the benefit of 99,000 shot instances per year. All that data improves the training and accuracy of their machine learning algorithms.The fact that SSTI missed the 4 shots in April 2016 is not terribly surprising given that the accuracy of their detection was 80% or less at the time. They sent out 99,000 alerts in 2017, and 2016 should be similar to that. With 80% accuracy at the time they obviously would have to have some false negatives. It also does not surprise me that the judge, looking at the accuracy level and lack of detection of the shots, would be skeptical about the technology. One nice thing about our legal system is the bar for evidence is supposed to be high. What would be useful is a comprehensive analysis of all the cases where SSTI shot detection was used in trials and whether it was admitted or excluded. If there are a lot of cases and you plot them on a time line, would we see a pattern where the SSTI data becomes more acceptable to the judges over time as the technology improved? What percentage of the time is SSTI shot detection admitted into a trial? A single trial, while interesting, does not really tell us how credible SSTI data is in criminal cases as a whole.My sense is SSTI shot detection in criminal trials is a minor factor in the overall value proposition of the service. If SSTI shot detection was never used in trials, to what degree would that affect the value of the service to its customers?Your discussion of valuation was useful. SSTI's market cap is $351.7m. Their revenue guide for next year is $45m to $47m. Much of their revenue is existing deferred revenue or recurring revenue and highly predictable. The guidance midpoint of $46m gives us a 2019 price to sales ratio of 7.6. They should be profitable in Q4 2018 and profits should go up in 2019.In terms of revenue growth rate, revenue went up 30% in 2015, 38% in 2016, 49% in 2017, 49% YTD through Q3 2017, and 54% for Q3 2018 over the prior year (from Investor's Day presentation). They have steadily improving margins as the business scales. If we assume revenue growth continues at a 40% to 50% CAGR and that EPS scales faster than revenues, is a 2019 P/S ratio of 7.6 reasonable? That is the key question, imho. I should also mention they have no debt and a pile of cash on the balance sheet.It is also the case that revenue growth could accelerate further as the technology improves and gains traction. There is huge pressure on mayors, police chiefs, and city councils to do something about gun violence. Gun violence happens every day and is widely trumpeted by the press. This is a powerful motivator for cities to adopt SSTI and comes with zero marketing cost.One piece of data that I find compelling is the huge growth of SSTI in the most sophisticated policing jurisdictions - Chicago and New York. My view is that we are going to see a consensus form among the community of cities that SSTI-like technology is going to become standard, similar to CCD cameras and license plate readers. There is also a huge potential international market and SSTI may be starting to get some traction there. Toronto is planning on deploying the technology, which is encouraging. Management is very optimistic about Latin America.Finally, it seems to me that SSTI is a perfect fit to the emerging smart city strategies. Their technology is being embedded in street lights from GE and Verizon, and they now have agreements where Verizon is going to sell their technology. It is not difficult to envision a time where a shot will be detected and cameras will focus within a second or two on the location and drones will automatically be dispatched to the crime scene. SSTI also now has their Missions product where the shot data will inform the predictive policing service. Missions is a natural cross sell to SSTI's existing customer base.It is also worth noting that SSTI has no competitors as far as I know and they have 32 patents on their technology and a very large shot database with which to train machine learning algorithms. With the caveat that I have not read the patents, those things seem to me to constitute a moat for SSTI. A second moat is they are rapidly locking up the major cities and it is becoming progressively harder for a competitor to displace them.Bottom line is that we could very well see growth accelerate going forward.It seems to me SSTI would be highly valuable to a smart city vendor, or companies like AAXN. I would be surprised if they are not a potential acquisition candidate.Your point on the lack of an independent 3rd party validation of their accuracy claims is a good point. I really wish management would address that. It also disappointed me that management did not explain the lawsuit settlement in their earnings conference call, particularly the details around the 5th shot which was at the core of the lawsuit. Anyway, just my 2 cents.Grok42",

"they dont market it to be used as accusatory instrument,the short case makes no sense expect for the high valuation",
"Hey FuzzyPanda, judges make different personal determinations all the time. This judge does not necessarily speak for all of New York. The same way one judge (an elected official in Illinois) can decide that standardized field sobriety tests are hocus pocus in a DUI investigation. That determination, regardless of the standardization via the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, might mean a lost dui case but plenty of other judges put a ton of credence into that type of evidence. I know the example isn’t exactly the same but it is a parallel. If you listen in on some of the radio scanner traffic in Chicago, a lot of times when people call in shots-fired, the cops ask the dispatch if shotspotter picked it up. That’s truthfully because they believe in the accuracy of shotspotter and they are less prone to believe the call is bonafide (there’s a ton of calls of shots fired that are fabricated). They’ll still investigate the call but if there’s a shotspotter event, they flood the area sometimes minutes before a call comes out. If there’s a shotspotter plus a phone call, it’s super likely at least shell casings will be recovered. Yes, shotspotter misses some instances and they do have misfires of their own but the misfires at least are precautionary.",
"Okay, upon reading the case here are some thoughts:1. The case is disturbing if someone changed a shot to frame someone2. It is a positive for the technology though, since the technology correctly identified the shots. Sounds like they need a process around changes.3. Since court evidence is not the primary use case, it seems this judge helped SSTI since, in the future, they won't be dragged into these fights.4. The main use case is finding where the shots are going on and getting people to check it out visually.",

"New power management announcements are in my opinion very good ones.

"I'm a little late to the discussion here, but my lateness did give me the opportunity to read a lot of comments.In reply to almost all of those comments - on GE's finances, on spin-offs, on bonds, on Culp's appearing ill at east in the interview, on former GE CEOs, etc. - those comments, and Wall Street, and former CEOs, bonds, spin-offs, cash flow, etc., all focus on financial analysis.  Culp is not a finance guy.  He's an operations guy.  Most people don't ""get"" what he's going to do.  Look at the Danaher Business System.  That's similar to what he's going to bring to GE.  No cash flow in a given operation?  There will be in 18-24 months, and it will increase each year after that, too.  Customers unhappy, getting ready to jump ship?  Give Culp 12-18 months and the customers will be much happier, and that level of satisfaction will be a baseline for going forward.Culp is not a financial engineer.  He's an operations guy.  He is working 18-hours a day, 7-days a week, with staff he has brought in who know how to do what he wants to do, to make GE manufacturing and services more efficient and effective.  There will be GE managers who will resist.  He expects that.  They'll get a chance to get on-board, and if they don't, they're gone.  I expect most GE employees will welcome purposeful changes to operations, especially the people on the floor who every day see things that can and should be improved, made more effiicenty and effective.  They're going to be all over Culp's changes because they want a job, and they know if things don't improve, their job is gone.  So, they're motivated.Culp doesn't like to talk to a financial audience (CNBC, Wall Street, most shareholders) because that audience doesn't speak his language - they won't understand what he's going to do, and he can't explain it in 30 seconds, so he hems and haws and trys to get through a financial discussion without alienating too many financial types (Wall Street analysts).Take a look at John Deere in the past few years.  They regularly beat forecasts due to ""cost reductions"".  What is that?  Firing people?  Using cheaper parts?  Cutting back on heat?  No - it's systematically and purposefully increasing efficiency and effectiveness.  You don't do that with a spreadsheet - you get out on the floor and in offices and engage people in the process of improving efficiency and effectiveness.That's what Alan Mulally did at Boeing - got 373 assembly from 30 days to 3.  That's why Ford brought him in at Ford.  Then he left, and Ford went nowhere after that.  There are too many financial types as CEOs.  Mulally was an engineer who made his name improving operational efficiency/effectiveness at Boeing.  Not a finance guy.It will take 12-18-24 months to begin to see, then take note, then be impressed, with the improved operational effectiveness efficiency of GE operations.  The improvements we see in 24 months will not be the end - it will be the baseline for going forward.You'll see some positive signs in 12 months, some instances of good news in 18, confirmation of a broad turnaournd in 24.  Give Culp time - you'll be glad you did.",
"Unfortunate that the transcript misquoted the quote by John Wooden.  Transcript says ""Be quick but don't hurt.""  Mr. Culp actually said ""Be quick but don't hurry"".

"WG,I appreciate your take on this. GE has been quite an adventure for me. I first bought shares on March 4, 2009 at $6.44. I had been watching the stock for quite some time, but never pulled the trigger. On that day Bill Gross came out and said ""GE is not AIG"" which of course had already blown up. I felt then that at that price the market was starting to anticipate bankruptcy. That purchase made me feel so smart several years later. Once the dividend reached $0.24/quarter I'm looking at 15% yield on cost plus large capital gains. In the years hence I added more at various times when it went ""on sale"" (you know this drill....buy when it's 20% off highs, etc.). So of course my overall cost basis went up. Added some more few times in the last year. Never sold. What a humbling experience. Every new low I keep thinking that if sell now it will be a mistake. I'll just do something worse. Then it just keeps going lower. OUCHI also watched the interview after the fact. I actually liked his style, although I can see why some may not. I must admit however that I do disagree with such a firm distinction between liquidity and leverage. To me they are without a doubt joined at the hip. Too much leverage under the right scenarios can in fact cause a liquidity crisis and there are literally countless examples of this that I have seen over the last 37 years.

"William, you are right, the future of GE stock is very much dependent on Tusa’s statements and also correct in saying his calls have been right on over the last two years.. I have been critical of the Immelt decusions going  back to the spin out of Synchrony, the Alstom Acquisition , the stock buy backs the BHI deal and the lack of organizational focus and business plan for the IofT. This goes back to 2015. I keep asking: does anyone know what Tusa’s position was on the above decisions? I do know that most of those activities  and decisions were heralded as beneficial by the financial community and stated as creating “.value.” for the shareholders. The idea that one can sell off profitable businesses in which there is a large fielded base, great name recognition and competitive products and still grow profit seems contradictory on its face. I agree with the necessity to cut costs, streamline management and the monetizing of the BHGE holdings. Eventually, however,  retained businesses have to be operationally managed correctly for viable businesses to be sustained.  Salient questions about the ability of management teams in power and oil and gas to accomplish sound operational management remain. Along with the decisions Culp has made, I view the organizational announcement about the organizational change in power as a sign that he recognizes that power management has been unfocused, that the Alstom’s poison pill must be corrected and that the gas turbine fielded base is an area that has potential. Conversely it appears to me that the operational management in healthcare and for that matter Transportation is doing well and I don’t agree with the disposal of health care.

"@WG Investment Research I thought that the Baker Hughes deal was put together with GE committing to spin off Baker Hughes to GE shareholders.  If it is now going to be a secondary offering of only a portion of the shares, I believe, at a minimum, that is a breach of trust with the shareholders of both companies.  I, also, would be concerned about GE continuing to hold a majority of the Baker Hughes shares.  GE put its own management into a company which needed management with specialized skills in the oil industry.  The price of the Baker Hughes stock has never recovered the way it should have.  I believe that these actions add to management's credibility problem.Just a thought or two.",

"I'm quite fed up of the criticism of Angeliki Frangou (AF) which you find in various shipping oriented stock forums, and now also in this article.AF has done a great job with NMM. My main complaint when it comes to the AF criticism is that it comes from retail investors like myself, who seem to only focus on immediate returns through the stock price or through sky-high dividends. If you were in the shoes of AF most of you would probably do more or less the same as her. Focus on the economy of your firms and avoid bankruptcy. It's naïve to think that dividends or stock price movements to benefit retail investors are high on the priority list.And of course she will look into how she can use NMM to save NM. Any company and owner would do that. That's one of the main reasons for why you split your holdings into a conglomerate of companies. Secure that your whole business don't go bankrupt in case of incidents with some of your assets. And if one of your assets is in trouble, see if the other assets can help out the one in trouble. And why complain? NMM gives a good yield, is doing very well, and it's just a matter of time before the stock price goes up again. But some doesn't seem to accept that things take time, and that a business owner may have other more important priorities to keep a complete business alive.",

Frangou has screwed shareholders so many times nobody with any history with the company trusts her. The stock price is a direct reflection of her.,

The dividend and to kick out AF.I am under the impression that we all will make money if the company does well, stays afloat now that the BDI is low and wait until the BDO goes to 2000-3000.This is when the company is in safe waters, money starts flowing in. Longer Charter rates at high rates are a normal thing and the asset values are high.This is when the dividend will increase and when the overall value of the company will increase resulting in an increase of the share price.I think AF is doing a good job making sure we even have a company when the BDO reaches higher levels. Because if they pay out dividends now and not reserve cash what will happen in a prolonged bad market?They pay down debt, Reserve cash and secure the company, yet they are bad managers. This makes no sense to me.If this was like GE that we saw Af sell our vessels to her own private company yes, but the lady has all her stakes with us so why all this hate?We all need to relax and have patience and pray for better rates.",

"The problem with NMM is that it is Angelika's bank account.  Surely I am not the only person here who has awakened one morning to wonder ""where did my $10,000 go"".  The essential problem here is 10 of 10 indicators of egregious insider trading - specifically with the timing of issuance of new stock diluting the investment of those not in the know.I'm always wondering - do people really believe that they are protected by the police while they are sipping lattes at a sidewalk bistro?  I am also wondering if prosecution of Martha Stewart's infraction (lying) is a fair indicator of the sharpness of SEC's teeth and the reach of their effectiveness.So if you do like I did and evaluate NMM based on the classic indicators, you might be a redneck.  In fact you might be a redneck if you wonder why you even bother reading the classic disclaimer statements.NMM's ""front"" is that of a shipping company; but the real business is a very well managed confidence game.  Angeliki Franjou lured investors with what amounts to a PONZI with promises supported by share prices  driven by new investors seeking outrageous dividends.  Meanwhile the ""no hedge"" left NMM running on fumes until the bottom dropped out of the BDI and left thousands wondering ""what the hell just happened.""  Meanwhile one year in the shipping industry is one year of age added to a fleet of gigantic money pits worth only the difference between lease rate and operation with depreciation tacked on for good measure.  Now when the number goes negative, it is like being extorted (I'll call your wife) by a street  hooker with a Brooklyn accent.  I once had a doctor explain to me how to tighten the Sphincter muscles.  Oh my goodness - people will watch and be puzzled.I have learned a big lesson, but hell - I may be wrong.

This IPO failure removed a chance for NMM to ' realize' value in NMCI and the potential 'drop down' from their long-term fixed containerships to NMCI in exchange for cash. On a separate note, the failure to realize value from NMCI is a reason why we feel our NAV valuation is secondary to our FCF method.I did not see the news this failed.

"DTF Capital, I think you may be double counting the containerships in you NAV?  I assume they are already in your value of current fleet, then later you add $150M for their sale to NMCI.  Hence double counting.  If that isn't correct, I think you need to reword that section a bit as it reads that way to me.Also until proven otherwise, I think we have to assume AF will try to use NMM to save NM to whatever extent she can, and apply a discount for that.  To what extent that will be possible, and how ""above board"" any such life preserver thrown by NMM is, being a big question mark.  I for one don't have a problem with NMM helping save its parent (ship drop-downs, etc.)  PROVIDED any help is done at fair market arm's length pricing.  With AF, that cannot be assumed.  Ironically, NMM may be much more valuable with NM in bankruptcy or Mrs. Frangou otherwise out of the picture.Disclosure - long NMM",
"Thanks for the work dtf.  This past week has seen many well written/ researched articles about nmm and the Navios empire.  As a consolation to my own investment choices it is somewhat comforting to find that many others have been ""fooled"" by AF.  All of the recent articles come to the same conclusion: although there have been some wise decisions, in the whole, AF has been a toxic manager that has destroyed large amounts of investor capital.  The real question, especially where NMM is concerned, is why do we keep allowing this to happen?The terms of the initial NMM ipo state 95% of profits are to be distributed to unit holders.  Is there not some legal recourse available to force this?  Are we all just happy to stand back and allow AF to systematically destroy our investment further?  I don't pretend to be a legal expert..but..if Norm could force AF to come to her senses perhaps we NMM holders should consider this as well....trader",
"Two comments,  first the debt overhang is a bigger issue.  With 67m of FCF you would still depend on rolling the debt.  Further you would need to roll it st a time when most are predicting a recession.  So arguable the future financial in 2020 will look way worse.  Second NM tried to “steal” cap structure preference from the preferred  back in 2017.  Basically trying to make them zombie preferred.  That is grossly unethical and the MGMT now has a stigma of trying to screw over shareholders.  AF and GEORGE Economeau must have gone to same school of corporate management.  Once It’s clear what NM will do to manage there upcoming debt maturities and to the extent NMM is free of machinations it will trade according to fundamentals.  I think you guys got 2 more years of depressed prices.  I have NM-H and rue the fact that I didn’t sell at 17 in 2017.",

I also think there is a ton of hidden/embedded value that the market hasn't caught onto yet, but I've already shared my views on that so I'll just leave it there.The moves in all of these mega cap tech stocks are incredible though, whoever has been selling lately has absolutely no concern for price, so it's impossible to try and buy on underlying fundamentals (it's not just etf selling either, if it was everything would be down roughly the same percentage).  When $750B companies move 3,4,5% a day with regularity, someone is just blowing out of positions, and it's most likely not their money or they wouldn't be selling large blocks in an already weak tape in an illiquid holiday market. There is a lot of value across all sorts of different sectors and industries right now, and when you can buy GOOGL at the same forward multiple as Proctor & Gamble, it's obvious there are some dislocations in the market that can't last forever, but it's impossible to know when it will break.

How many more quarters the Fed will increase rates? The air is getting very thin up there. In my opinion we will see a change in pattern next year.

While I don’t think I’m qualified to speak on behalf of the cardiac results, I can speak to the RA results. Very intriguing. Keep in mind that there are now very effective therapies for TNF failures, mainly trying a different TNF inhibitor, rituximab, and even better, Jak inhibitors. And the half of the story on Jak inhibitors hasn’t even been written yet as now we are going to begin targeting specific Jaks and even Tyk2. So, I think the TNF failure market is quickly being parceled. However, maybe there’s something to get MSCs injected and have them increase their effectiveness over months. I wonder how durable this response it too. I think the biggest knock of MSCs is the apparent lack of a mechanism of action. Science loves mechanisms and we’re missing one here. And it may be a very complex one (beyond secretion of TGF-b). Maybe I’m the one missing one though. What is their current thinking in terms of mechanism?",

Most are...If investors (and they did in the 1970s) pay up for conglomerates, then equity value could be created so long as a high P/E parent purchases lower P/E companies.  Also, conglomerates can create value if the business units are synergistic and play-off of each other's core competencies.   Conglomerates could also work if they're simple, meaning we have 3 companies combined, not 30.  An example would be Corning (GLW) which has superficially different businesses but they utilize Corning's skills in ceramics/glass.  So we have Fiber Optics, LCD Displays, Gorilla Glass, Catalytic Converters, Lab Glass, etc..",
I'm just here to read the same regurgitated comments from the AMZA trolls.,
"As a former employee of both Westinghouse and GE, the difference then was engineering and manufacturing competence.westinghouse products just weren’t has good. In the business in which I was employed in Westinghouse GE was the industry leader because, frankly, their products were better designed and matched by a much more repeatable, less  prone to rejects manufacturing product. As time went by Westinghouse couldn’t compete and sold the business. I have commented often that the deemphasis in engineering and manufacturing in favor of financial engineering started in the ?Welch era and doubled down by Immelt has more to do with the current mess in GE than any intrinsic, inevitable age related factor,",
Westinghouse Electric was a large but smaller company than GE in the 20th century that competed heavily with GE. From at least the mid 1970's to the 1980's' Westinghouse effectively disintegrated completely as a business organization in that time span.  Currently GE has started on the same disintegration path with no clear idea (to me) when it will end  This is from an investor born and raised (a long time ago) in Schenectady. Thank you for this wonderful article.  I hope everyone reads it because there are so many other large business entities (examples) who have disintegrated like Westinghouse.  Your article on GE has certainly helped my thinking process.,
"The common thread between gas turbines, jet engines, transportation and healthcare stems from the fact that they all involve the generation of energy. The original basis for much of the businesses GE was traditionally in was the generation of electricity and the products that used it. Where GE departed from this idea was in the acquisitions of NBC or entering into plastics, going so far as to buy lumber yards to sell their plastic building products.  The healthcare business evolved largely from the X-ray product and basic engineering knowledge is required in thermodynamics, electro magnetism and materials to deal with the the energy and temperature regimes found in engines, turbines and cat scans and MRIs, The problems for GE today stem principly from one bad decision after another starting with the Alstom’s acquisition and the share buy backs. Those moves perhaps might be traced to very didasterous personnel policies, a deemphasis on manufacturing and engineering in favor of financial engineering initiated by Welch and doubled down on by Immelt.",
"Good article.  RE: ""Conglomeration was, is and always will be a bad idea: I never understood the allure of conglomerates,....""I must chime in about the conglomeration fad in the late 1960s / early 1970s when I worked at Domino Sugar (aka American Sugar Refining Company) in Baltimore. About that time Domino bought Duff Norton, a tiny firm making chain hoists. Yes, chain hoists. The company also owned Milwaukee tool for a while. Neither had any connection to the sugar business. Our corporate whiz kid CEO, Bobby Quittmeyer, gushed that our stodgy old sugar company was now a conglomerate as if he achieved something special. WTF? (Granddad buys a Corvette but he's still a granddad, not a kid again.) Of course, as a conglomerate the company name had to change as befits a Wall Street darling, so Bobby Q hired an outside firm to refine our image. For the princely sum of $50k some analyst changed our name from American Sugar Refining Company to AMSTAR and gave us a logo reminiscent of Postal Service and AMTRAK logos. But along came high fructose corn syrup and very quickly AMSTAR's cane sugar business became a pittance of its former self and had to close refineries in Boston, Brooklyn and Philadelphia, leaving only Baltimore and New Orleans. The company has traded hands in the past 30 years like a cheap Christmas fruitcake that gets endlessly re-gifted.   Ah success.Conglomeration was the rage on Wall St, the thinking was that good managers could manage anything so why not diversify into other businesses and manage them to your lasting glory.The conglomeration craze is over, for case histories of a genre run amok look at:- Gulf & Western ( en.wikipedia.org/... )- LTV ( en.wikipedia.org/... )- AMSTAR ( en.wikipedia.org/... )Who knows what will happen to GE. Disparate business segments are probably better off as separate firms. I don't see much benefit to keeping wind turbines, jet engines and hospital MRI gear all in the same corporate family.

"Better to save comparisons with the Bataan Death March to survivors and family.  GE never fought against such long odds.  GE did not voluntarily exhaust their last vestige of humanity to be shot and then gutted or stomped to death.  GE made dumb choices when they were rolling in the dough.  There is no appropriate analogy for GE. The word ""squander"" comes to mind however.",
Using the metaphor of comparing the Bataan Death March to investing in GE is blasphemy! Have you no respect for those who gave their lives so the nitwits like you (and me) could invest in a free market?,
"Don’t agree that all of GE products are old and declining. Engines are at the leading edge, the gas turbines among the leaders and the healthcare products amongst the leaders. Even the locomotives are the most efficient in the world, Further the software and  logistics pipelines in support of many of these products are among the best. The systems that engines has to provide preventive maintenance to each individual engine in its unique operating environment is the best in the world. I also don’t agree that because a company has been in a given business for generations, it should leave that business. My GE example is large appliances. True there is plenty of competition , but the market is large, won’t go away in the foreseeable future and the supposed oncoming large IofTmarket place is seen as encompassing large appliances, The Chinese buyers concluded that retention of the GE logo was important if they were to succeed in realizing a good investment. The pity is that the great financial engineers who have run GE over the last 25 years didn’t value the logo, the tremendous name recognition and the potential of the large fielded base to generate revenue and incomeas highly as the Chinese, nor did they connect the software IofT thrust on which close to 5B investment was spent with the large appliance business. GE power has been very badly affected by the purchase of  Alstom and the top management turnover and inexperience. In fact in my view the most disastrous development in GE that is traceable to Jack Welch and doubled down by Immelt was the manager is a manager philosophy and the deemphasis on engineering. The former has been responsible for creating a senior management structure that generally did not grow up in the businesses they led and the latter replaced the legacy emphasis on engineering and manufacturing with financial engineering. The idea that took hold was if a new technology was needed it could be bought and that acquisitions were the preferred way of growing rather than internal development. The stand out exception was the engine business where the management promoted from within, developed new products internally for the most part and developed the best maintenance support system in the world,By the way, I venture to advance the idea that software is the modern equivalent of producing an expensive product with relatively less investment and so is the service business. Making physical product takes much more initial investment, and generally requires much more complex development and more conviction by management to be successful.",

Smaller newer renewables companies have an advantage in less overhead and (now) better good-will value.My guess (and it is only a guess, made just for fun) is that IF GE doesn't really screw up right now, you are looking at a best case scenario that the stock price will hover within a +- $2.00 range of where it is now for quite a long period, with a ho-hum dividend and eventually, will start to rise (say in 5 years).

The financial services business should be sold/wound down.  Given the complexity, may be a set of transactions.  The remaining business would have consist of three turbine businesses: aircraft engines (includes aircraft and marine gas turbines), power turbines (gas and steam turbines), renewable energy (windmill and hydro turbines).  I like the nascent move to spit the steam and gas turbine parts of the power business also.  So 4 divisions would be fine.  Major cuts of course should be made at corporate headquarters. Gut central research (no more CRD...let R&D happen at the businesses).  Kill corporate and six sigma organizations.  Get rid of corporate marketing roles or any similar functional excellence silliness.

GE excels in aviation and medical. The power division is being revamped. Partnerships have been made with BH and in the rail business. This is going to take time.

"WILMINGTON, North Carolina—November 13, 2018—GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) and its PRISM technology have been selected by Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA) to support the U.S. Department of Energy’s Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) program which seeks to utilize fast neutron spectrum technology to support accelerated development of fuels and materials for U.S. advanced reactors.The project is focused on advancing the reactor design and developing cost estimates for a new fast neutron spectrum irradiation capability. The results of the project will help inform a DOE decision about whether to construct a sodium-cooled fast test reactor that could become operational as early as 2026. GEH and Bechtel National Inc. will advance the design and cost estimates for the VTR based on GEH’s PRISM technology.   “The VTR is a vital and strategic project for the U.S. and its promising advanced reactor industry, and we applaud the administration and Congress for making this technology a priority,” said Jay Wileman, GEH President and CEO. “Our VTR project team combines GEH’s strength as a nuclear plant vendor, service provider and nuclear fuel fabricator with Bechtel’s strength in nuclear project management, engineering, procurement and construction. The mature PRISM technology is ideally suited to meet the VTR mission needs.”“The U.S. currently has no capability to test these fuels and materials,” said Peggy McCullough, a Bechtel senior vice president and general manager of Bechtel’s Nuclear, Security, and Operations business line. “Advanced reactors hold great promise but their components need the proper testing before they can be licensed and used in energy-producing reactors. That’s what the Versatile Test Reactor will provide. It’s extremely important for the science community, industry, regulators, and the future of nuclear energy research.”Building on the proven principles of the EBR-II, an integral sodium-cooled fast reactor prototype that was operated successfully for more than 30 years by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) in Idaho, PRISM is the only sodium-cooled reactor to have successfully completed the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) preapplication review process.

"Buenos Aires, November 15, 2018 - YPF Luz has signed an agreement with GE Renewable Energy for the construction of Los Teros Wind Farm, located in Azul, Province of Buenos Aires.The construction will begin in November. The project will employ around 150 people during the construction phase and an investment of US $144 million is expected.Los Teros, which will feature 32 GE wind turbines of 3.83 MW, will have an installed capacity of 122 MW, an estimated capacity factor* of ~57% and an extremely high efficiency level. This project will establish Azul as a location with excellent natural conditions for wind power.The objective of YPF Luz in developing this project is to provide renewable, efficient and reliable energy to customers through the Wholesale Electricity Market (MATER). YPF Luz has already signed contracts to supply Toyota and Coca-Cola FEMSA with renewable energy from Los Teros.Los Teros will be the first wind farm that GE will build in the country, through a turnkey contract that includes the installation of wind turbines and the construction of a substation to connect the 132 kV line between Tandil and Olavarría. The Wind Farm will be constructed over an area of 2450 hectares, 45 km from Azul.The wind energy produced in Los Teros may enable the reduction of 5.5 million tons of CO2 emissions in 20 years, when compared to the impact of having the same energy produced by a thermal power plant, which is equivalent to the saving of 58.000 m3 of Diesel, or 98 million m3 of natural gas.For both companies, this is one additional step to contribute to the adoption of a more diversified and sustainable energy mix, an area where Argentina is a recognized leader on the continent. The country has a goal of having 20% of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2025.""We celebrate the beginning of a new Project to the Renewable energy development which will be undoubtedly an important contribution to the country's sustainable development"" affirmed Martín Mandarano, CEO of YPF Luz. He also added: ""We are proud to be able to promote this renewable project together with GE, a world leader in energy technology and strategic partner in Argentina.""Vikas Anand, General Manager for GE's Onshore Wind Business in the Americas said ""We are excited to be partnering with YPF Luz to help them achieve their renewable energy goals.

"PARIS—14 November 2018—The GE (NYSE: GE) consortium, established by GE Power and CIE Sociedad Anonima, has been chosen by Itaipu Binacional to provide electrical equipment for the early stages of the modernization project of the Itaipu Dam.Located at the border between Brazil and Paraguay, reaching nearly 200 meters high and 8 kilometers long, the Itaipu Dam has a total power generation capacity of 14 gigawatts, enough to meet 75 percent of total Paraguay electricity needs and about 15 percent of Brazil at the same time.Having produced more than 2.5 billion megawatt-hours (MWh) of power since 1984, Itaipu Dam is the largest hydro plant in the world in cumulated power and the second in terms of installed power. Recently, Itaipu Binacional has announced a 10-year program to modernize the plant, replacing obsolete equipment installed 30 years ago by more advanced technologies and machinery.The three-year contract between the GE consortium and Itaipu Binacional will focus on the electrical modernization of the 24 overhead cranes, essential to lift the heavy equipment—such as hydro turbines—for the modernization. The lifting equipment, dating from 1984, has a lifting capacity from 10 up to 1,000 tons. For this mission, GE will provide AC motors, low-voltage drives and programmable logical controllers and encoders, which will help extend the cranes’ lifetime for another 20 years. This upgrade will be the first step of the global modernization project.“Regarded as a great source of national pride, the Itaipu hydroelectric plant has produced more electricity than any other hydro infrastructure in the world. In 2016, it also set a new world record for annual energy generation with the production of 103.1 million MWh,” said Mauro José Corbellini, executive techinical director, Itaipu Binacional. “The modernization of this monumental site will breathe new life into the decades-old infrastructure, and the partnership with GE is the first crucial step to start the journey.”“We are excited to be part of this vast modernization project, helping Itaipu Dam to improve its supply of energy and maintain its key role in clean energy generation for both Paraguay and Brazil. Our electrical equipment will help the 24 overhead cranes and gantries to operate effectively and safely, enabling them to bring together key plant equipment with precision and efficiency,” said Gagan Sood, CEO of Industry, Power and Wind segment, GE’s Power Conversion business.“The one decade-long modernization project will help the Itaipu hydro plant to continue to provide colossal energy output. Electrification is our strength to perpetuate our commitment to develop hydroelectric energy as an efficient, viable and sustainable power resource, either via new builds or upgrades,” said Azeez Mohammed, president and CEO, GE’s Power Conversion business.",
"Aswath,really good article. Brings back good memories. I bought GE in the mid '90's and ran well with Jack. Had forgotten the shock I got along with 2 of my friends that also owned GE when it was announced GE was 48% financial. Should have sold then.Did get out 2 years ago. You covered everything except the DOJ and SEC investigations that I think will really hurt and bring GE down.This is all so sad;they were a great company.",
Thank You Professor Aswath Damodaran! a great education this evening! JD,
"The lessons of GE are to know what you are buying or own and to pay attention to what is going on.The author feels compelled to blame Jack Welch and he is minimally correct. Welch did venture into financial services. He also presented GE as entirely industrial hiding the financial side. However Welch did not start the issues and in fact GE had gotten out of its small home mortgage operation in 2000 prior to Immelt taking over. It was Immelt that bought WMC Mortgage, ventured off into CDOs and an SIV, bought Consumer debt at its peak and bought massive RE holdings at the peak and sold Long term care insurance. Eight years after taking the helm he drove GE off the cliff to be rescued by the government. I dont really care who gets the blame but many seem to want to assign blame to Welch. What I will say is that this investor stayed tuned and understood GE. Selling GE shares around Labor day 2007 for $40+ per share and bought back at $7 in March 2009. I sold again several years ago around $18. For at least 5 years I have been commenting here on SA with concerns about GE. I dont know what happens but I suspect the US Govt doesnt want GE to go belly up. My guess would be that billions of additional shares get issued to a Buffett or Peltz and GE Capital gets hived off in some manner. Issues like this usually end in a bang and I would advise waiting for 2 decades of secrets to finally all come rolling out and a capital raise to occur. Like a party investors should arrive fashionably late if at all.",

"Totally agree with Dr. Damodoran's viewpoint, agree that GE should survive and thrive. Conglomeration is a bad idea, unfortunately its not dead yet, AMZN is also slowly becoming a conglomerate, from online retail to media to package delivery to grocery to neighborhood digital pay convenience stores to 4 star AMZN product stores, to who knows what else...quintessential conglomerated growth...   Simplicity definitely not, and probably someday as complex and tangled like GE is today.  Its taking on WMT, TGT, WBA, UPS, etc.   My view is that FB will give it good competition in the years ahead, after its current data security events, its already got a 1B plus audience (still growing), and the business model monetization is not based on subscriptions, rather on ad revenue, and NO DEBT.  Fb will have online retail next then data mining service as to our consumption behavior, then online international payment/transfer services (whattsapp), etc.  lets see what happens. GE is going through an upgrade.  It should survive and thrive in the long run, I anticipate 2023 to 2025 around $25 to $30 stock price.",

"""Conglomeration was, is and always will be a bad idea: I never understood the allure of conglomerates, even in their heyday.""Good read, I enjoyed it.In the case of the above quote, I would generally agree, but not in GE's case.. . . From the first foray into the lightbulb, then electrical generation, making home appliances & electronics to create a market for electricity, Edison's pioneering work in moving pictures evolving into Television and the foundation of NBC in the 1920s, they were around for the Wright's first flight, and on and on - to the point of creating GEC to finance the industrial operations and the needs of its larger customers.This company's growth was both organic, as well as reflected the Gilded Age and eclectic mind of its founder - holding fast to its ideals and vision for almost a century, until going off the rails with Welch's expansion of GEC and ruination of the company's culture.GE was a piece of the country's history, the like of which we will never see again.As bearish as I am on the company, what has happened is sad, but the consequence of decades of mismanagement bereft of values.",

Its really sad what has happened to GE. But unfortunately it’s going to get a lot worse for common stock holders. You’re better off just buying the debt if you believe in a turn around. But a turn around still will likely include common holders being wiped :(What’s scary is this has happened during a boom. Should the economy fall into a recession during the next 3 years GE’s demise will be accelerated.So sad that this once great company has been melted into the ground by Immelt 😣,

"I disagree with much of this article.  First of all the statement that nothing is growing is false.  Aviation is growing 10% a year for revenues and earnings.  Renewables are also growing revenues at that pace.The valuations shown reveal little analysis by the author and was slapped together with no analysis or support. A valuation of $52 billion for aviation is beyond laughable.  I wrote an article two days ago valuing GE sum of the parts.  Aviation based on aerospace comps is worth about $126 billion, a PE of 26.  Aviation has extremely predictable and growing revenues.  Investors love both.  It is the crown jewel and worth more than the rest combined.A valuation of -$24 billion for GE Capital is just as laughable and shows a complete lack of understanding what makes up the business.  Almost alll that $51 billion in debt is financing jet engines and gas turbines.  The customers are airlines and utilities, all very strong right now.  The issue is long term care which they have added $14 billion in reserves.  That is way more than Genworth which has the same stuff.  A value of $0 is more appropriate and probably conservative.Power at $73 billion is just as laughsble in the other direction,  Power is what has driven them down the past two years and is currently unprofitable. It may be in secular decline. I came up with $13 billion.Oil and gas should have been simple, Baker Hughes is publicly traded.  Its worth about $16 billion.Healthcare is flat but has a lot of promise.  I have seen media estimates of $60 billion.  I got $50 billion.  $28 billion is also laughable.The whole comcept that because the company is 128 years old its past its peak also shows a lack of analysis.  Is John Deere past its peak?  Its older.GE is worth about $16.30 sum of the parts.  Discount that 15 or 20% for being a conglomerate.  I used 15% because if all the sales and spinoffs happen, GE will be mostly aviation.(Edited)",

"Not on the same page here. When Sirius receives an increase in royalty fees, their sales and marketing, for now, has the pricing power to pass it on to the subscribers. When Spotify receives an increase in royalty fees, if it does not pass them on to its subscribers then it eats the extra fee. Spotify is already showing sign of trouble in making it in North America. They are discounting, increasing trial periods, handing out free Google Home Minis, starting a family plan that does not break even. This is not what they need to be doing. Broadcasting is not a very high profit business here for anyone. Sirius is the only one to be successful far and you could recite the reasons. Captive audience in auto, large section 801(b) savings for undertaking the danger and risk of broadcasting by satellite, Marketing magic in passing on fee increases to subscribers, NOLOS.The digital broadcasters always have the right to deal directly with the record labels. If they don't like what the record labels are asking, for songs not on demand, the broadcasters can get the statutory rate. For the on-demand broadcasts (narrowcasts?) they have to negotiate that with the record labels. Of this I am sure.Pandora chose for its premium subscriptions to to take the rates negotiated with the record labels for songs broadcast, on-demand or not. This seems a little odd at first blush since the labels you would not think are going to offer them equal or less rates on regular broadcast.On the low ethics side of this, if Pandora deals directly with record labels, the five percent fee that would go to SoundExchange goes to record labels instead. Also, if the royalty funds are distributed right to the record label, then it is their responsibility to pay the performers and they might not put in as much effort as SoundExchange to find the artists. Also on the devious side, if Soundexchange receives the money but can't find the artist for two or maybe three years, then I'll bet you think the money goes into the generally kitty and is distributed to needy artists who have been found. Wrong! The money goes back to the record labels to do with as they please.The official reason that Pandora chose to negotiate all broadcast license fees with the record labels, and this I read in one place and can't verify, is that they negotiated a minimum amount of royalties for Pandora to meet for a whole year. If they exceeded the minimum they would get a lower rate. They didn't meet the minimum and were accordingly punished.I was expecting a bounce today, but this? I don't like to see large moves in any direction. Would have preferred a couple more weeks or months of quiet correction.",
"The point is that $36 for six months seems to be their breaking point. So, in answer to your question, Sirius can - and will - do this because it is an extra $72 per year. It's incremental revenue and the incremental margin vs. no subscription makes it worthwhile.Yes, that is insightful. Part of the reason that Spotify has so much trouble becoming profitable - it gets a new bill for royalties with every new subscriber.There are many other YouTube videos. One got the price down to $5.00/month for six months but hated the hosts so I think he didn't renew. Another thinks that $5.00 is still too expensive ""for radio"" and they should fire the hosts and get lots of new listeners and make a profit.Probably worse in a way are the videos and comments on other videos that describe how Sirius takes a very harsh and threatening stance if your subscription auto-renewed and you did not pay (they did send me at least one email a month in advance to warn me of the upcoming auto-renew). To them if you hit your renewal date and have not opted out then you are renewed and you owe them no excuses. Like SXM suggests, better to write them a check or use a gift card than give them a credit card number.But I and others were sure that if you canceled early you were given a refund for unused days. Maybe what they mean above is that they pursue you for the time between auto-renew and your cancelation.Or maybe many who receive unexpected auto-renew bills just ignore them, and the amount due just keeps growing.",
"The SiriusXM auto-renew blues is now going viral on YouTube. For some people like Toyota buyers they will charge $99/year for the take-up. Everyone else full price. Or maybe all are getting the $99/year charge for take-up, but with sneaky auto-renew at full price. With this guy it went from full to $99/year to $5.00/month. with the $5.00/month renewable again and again as long as you don't wait until you get the full bill first. He thinks that $5 a month for all access is still too high.Anyway, I still don't understand how all this can not be a major problem for Sirius going down the road. If they have been really relying on enough old people to pay full and not notice it, Soon a very substantial majority will kow of the discounts and will be pissed.www.youtube.com/...",

"Interesting. Sinatra and his daughter cherished the song ""Nancy with the Laughing Face"" and it always seemed odd to me that Phil Silvers wrote the lyrics. Here's the story.""While Burke was out of their writer's bungalow, Phil Silvers, the comedian, a friend to both, entered and suggested to Jimmy that they write a song for Johnny's wife, Bessie, who was soon to celebrate a birthday. Silvers provided the lyrics, later revised by Van Heusen and Burke.""""At the party they sang 'Bessie... with the laughing face.' It was such a hit that they used it at other female birthday events. When they sang it as 'Nancy... with the laughing face' at little Nancy Sinatra's birthday party, Frank broke down and cried, thinking it had been written especially for his daughter; the trio wisely didn't correct him.""When Nancy refers to the song on her Sirius show, she never tells the story about who it was written for.Sinatra must really have something special musically if I'm so drawn to his music. Personally, I would have every reason to dislike him. Dislike the arrogance and nastiness of his ugly side and dislike all the success and friends and lovers out of envy.Since we were talking about Nicky Hopkins, I was trying to send you the file of his ""Edward, the Mad Shirt Grinder,"" the studio version of which was on obscure Quicksilver Messenger Service album Shady Grove. Everything is just so confusing with Apple, Microsoft, Adobe. Life would have been easier if everything had been Apple and all worked together first try. But that's not our economy.It's up on YouTube if you want to check it out. It's six and a half fairly stately minutes of musicianship followed by three minutes of insane piano led jam. If you don't like rock jams led by guitars then I don't suppose that you would like this either.",
"That rude remark was in persona, of course. He used that word ""chump"" a lot. I never use it.Sinatra was great to his friends and ugly to his (perceived) enemies. His ugly side is never viewed on Sirius' Sinatra channel. Not surprising, since his daughter Nancy is in control of the channel. Jim Webb found himself in Las Vegas and went to the Sands to see Sinatra. Sinatra had recorded a number of his early songs and really admired ""Didn't We Almost Make It."" At that time he was still a kid and Sinatra was like a god to him. Sinatra was all over him that day. Dinner on Sinatra. Sat with Webb and listened to him play the piano for an hour. Full of compliments.  To be treated by Sinatra as an equal.... Later called Webb to ask him if he could record just the middle part of ""MacArthur Park."" What was he going to say, No?Lots of well known people have stories like that. They were nobody compared to him yet he treated them as his oldest friends.On the other hand, when shooting the film ""Pal Joey,"" with Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak, he is said to have been very nasty to Novak.",
"I was going to record it. But it was right after I had recorded ""Something"" by John, no by Harrison. Nancy begged me not to record it.

So far we would have to say that it hasn't caused any major grief for Sirius.All those music services that you mention are just that: music: Lots of people like to listen to talk, political and sports, in their autos. I've heard that some even like news or business news as their primary home radio. You could find these stations over regular radio, although not as many, and with more time allocated to ads, but it's so much easier with SiriusXM integrated into your car's entertainment and media services.As for music, let me go back to what Meyer says over and over when given the chance: Sirius' principal competitors in music are not the streaming jukebox stations but FM hosted music stations. Here is a short but pithy article that I think hits on the differences well:www.digitaltrends.com/...For decades, SiriusXM has put big money into recruiting top radio talent to host its programs, and that investment has paid off big time. The list of celebrity personalities that grace the satellite airwaves is overwhelming. From talk show legends like Howard Stern (love him or hate him), to sports legends like Bill Walton and Tony Hawk, to legendary rock critics like Dave Marsh, the company has made a point of hiring some of the most important commentators for each individual station it broadcasts.He left out Cousin Brucie.The negatives for Sirius versus the streamers and FM, again as Meyer says over and over again, people do not want to pay for radio. And they really don't want to pay $300 a year for radio. If Sirius were demanding $300 dollars a year from all subscribers then I think that would become a big problem. But the available and relentless discounting that Sirius engages in I'm sure has kept many a subscriber who called Sirius with the clear intention of canceling.One more negative specific to Echo is that the current home Echo doesn't support Sirius as well as it supports the other music services. Name of song and artist not given, only the Sirius channel name. No support for any on-demand programming. Sirius on-demand includes a vast library of past interviews and informal in-studio performances. It also allows a certain degree of time shifting for most channels. If you missed the morning show on the NFL Channel, which most days is hosted in part by the Giants' radio announcers and thus includes more Giants' talk, when you get home you can load the morning show and listen to it. If you want to listen to Nancy Sinatra's weekly three hour show but miss the first hour, you can go back and listen to the show from the beginning.If Sirius and Amazon intend to be serious partners, they will have to improve the interface.Do you think that this comment will get me my 48th follower?",

"Sirius XM Is One Of The Stocks The World's Best Investors Are Buying Right Now !!!!!Sean Williams (Sirius XM Holdings): Although it's not a stock that'll make front-page news often, if ever, Sirius XM Holdings, the only satellite radio provider, has been the apple of some prominent investors' eyes of late.Following 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in mid-November, multibillionaires James Simons, the founder of famous quant fund Renaissance Technologies, and Kenneth Griffin, who runs Citadel Advisors, have been acquiring shares of Sirius XM. And do I fault them for their purchases? Not one bit.You see, Sirius XM has a handful of competitive advantages that give it a somewhat impenetrable moat. Perhaps the biggest difference between Sirius and, say, terrestrial or online radio is that its competitors are acutely reliant on advertising to drive revenue. The thing is, advertising ebbs and flows with the health of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, Sirius XM generated only $46.2 million from advertising in the third quarter out of $1.47 billion total sales. Even if its ad-pricing power were to weaken or ad demand were to slow, the impact would hardly be noticeable. To expand on this point, Sirius XM generates most of its revenue from subscriptions and royalties. Consumers are far less likely to cancel locked-in subscriptions than advertisers are to pull back on marketing during times of economic turbulence. It's yet another feather in Sirius XM's cap.It's also worth mentioning that Sirius XM has a relatively fixed-cost model. Whereas talent-acquisition costs can vary, its satellite network expenses are pretty much the same, regardless of how many subscribers it adds each quarter or year. This creates a scenario in which Sirius XM should be able to expand, or at worst maintain, its operating margins as time passes.Consider this one of those instances when investors should be paying close attention to what the big money is doing with Sirius XM.",

"I know you don't want to hear this, but the truth hurts !!!!!Sirius XM Holdings Outpaced Other Consumer Discretionary Stocks This Year.For those looking to find strong Consumer Discretionary stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Is Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) one of those stocks right now? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Consumer Discretionary sector should help us answer this question.Sirius XM Holdings is one of 258 individual stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #11 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups, measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group.The Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions. The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. SIRI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SIRI's full-year earnings has moved 4.26% higher within the past quarter. This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock's earnings outlook is more positive.According to our latest data, SIRI has moved about 12.69% on a year-to-date basis. At the same time, Consumer Discretionary stocks have lost an average of 3.89%. This means that Sirius XM Holdings is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns.Looking more specifically, SIRI belongs to the Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which includes 24 individual stocks and currently sits at #53 in the Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks in this group have gained about 10.74% so far this year, so SIRI is performing better this group in terms of year-to-date returns.",

"¡Hola! @Crunching Numbers So by buying the tracker I can pay $4.20 for a Sirius share. That sounds good. What if two weeks later I decide to sell it for the non-discounted rate?  ""I'd like $6.30 for each share please. I bought at a discount."" What if my purchaser doesn't honor the discount that I managed? It is quite possible that when I wanted to sell, the tracking shares wouldn't fetch any more than their discounted value. How many years has it been since the question of the discount first came up along with publicity over the tracking shares and speculation reigned over the way in which Liberty would narrow that discount?It is certainly tempting. Face it, Berkshire Hathaway is a powerful name. What percentage of Sirius would it be fair to say that Berkshire owned when including Sirius and trackers all together? Thirteen percent?For almost a decade now, reassessment of residential homes has been a leading growth industry on Long Island. It seemed like almost everyone who filed a grievance had their taxes lowered. But the reassessments were not based on reality. With the last reassessment of my home, the value came in about $80,000 under the Fair Market Value. If everyone who filed was getting this fictitious value placed on their homes, then who was making up for the lost property taxes from the reassessments?I see that it was all settled last week. Nassau County informed us of what we were supposed to know, that a general reassessment had taken place to go into effect next year. Under this reassessment the assessed value of my place leapt up to about $60,000 more than its Fair Market Value.If the county would like to purchase the property for its assessed value, or even ten percent lower, I'd be happy to comply.",

"Ratatattat - “...Can you please provide some insight on how buybacks work.”How they work is simple. The company uses a portion of the cash that the business generates to buy back shares as opposed to using that cash to reinvest in things like additional R&D, more Sales people, or acquisitions. The long term impact of the buybacks are just as simple. Consider that if there are only 10 shares outstanding and you own 1 of them, you own a 10% stake in the business. If the company buys back 1 of those shares and you still own 1, you know have an 11% stake in the business. Rather than just handing you cash back in the form of a dividend, the company is basically giving you a larger portion of ownership in the business.",

Buy now, relax and prosper, this is as close to a n-brainer as we're likely to see.",
Apple is a long term investment in my book. AAPL is a now buy.,
"@Sean Chandler, I agree with you.  There has been no change in the fundamentals of the company at all and AAPL stock fell by nearly 20% (if one considered its peak at 234) since its earnings report that beat on not just guided but expected revenues and profit.  Many people believe that Apple gave “weak” guidance for Q1’19.  I strongly disagree with that assessment.  Their guidance range included the optimistic revenue estimates of analysts at $91 billion.  It is true that the lower end of the guidance was $89 billion but that is reasonable and appropriate.  Many factors outside of Apple’s control may reduce its revenues.  Chief amongst them is a President who has promised to place 10% tariffs on “all” Chinese imports into China, which of course includes Apple products made in China.  The U.S. dollar value is rising, which will reduce revenues and earnings expressed in dollars.  I think that Apple cannot and should not be giving guidance that does not take these risks into consideration.  Apple share values fell by nearly 10% based on rumors that Apple is reducing the number of iPhones it is manufacturing based on the amount that supply chain companies are making.  As Tim Cook has repeatedly said, earnings reports have repeatedly shown every year, the amounts earned by Apple suppliers does not predict Apple sales.  These types of “soft” reports are meaningless and depend on many factors including how many devices Apple has made and plan to make.  They could easily go up and down by 20%.Why do people ignore the positive hard data?  For example, in the earnings report, Apple pointed out that their Q4’18 China sales increased 16% over Q4’17.  This is great news because over 30% of Apple’s revenues may be coming from China in the coming quarter.   There was just a report (news.softpedia.com/...) that Apple iPhones were the top selling smartphone in China during China’s Black Friday.  This means that sales of Apple products in China are beating Huawei, Xiaomi, OnePlus, and other Chinese manufacturers in their own country!Finally, reports and reviews of Apple two recently announced iPad Pro’s are absolutely glowing.  In fact, it would be very good for Apple if its iPad revenues grew by double digits and iPhone revenues slipped to single digits this coming year.  Apple share prices should not be so dependent on the performance of single product, such that rumors about supply chain could cause the stock shares to fall 15-20%.",
"Maybe the ""analyst"" rumours are being spread by the Chinese competitors using trolling and fake news. Just as the Russians did in the elections. Maybe Trump is right that the biggest threat of technological warfare through spreading fake news is now the Chinese! He is a specialist in at least recognising such opportunities...Anyway, I note that some of the suppliers to Apple who apparently have had orders curtailed are also suppliers to some of the largest Chinese phone manufacturers. How do we know one of them have not curtailed their production plans and that is the real issue? If they're clever enough, their consultants and trolls can reverse the story. Maybe the Chinese are also using Definers along with Facebook!",

"@jess perkins - nope. All that time I let emotion deny me buying back in (for more than I'd sold at). Don't follow me... haha. And that from someone who holds AMD - as Pooh said when he launched Piglet into the beehive by accident: ""Well, I don't remember thinking that through.""",
All I know is that APPLE has been consistently rising. It’s pretty hard to believe a company who lives in the leading edge (not bleeding edge) of technology that has a great profitability can fail in the near 25 year future. I only own two stocks APPLE @$88 and NVIDIA @$63. It hard to know which one is better or should be held the longest. Will be slowly cashing out in 5 years for retirement purposes. It should help me live comfortably for 30 years. I love both stocks. Disappointed I didn’t buy both one year earlier because my position would have been triple. I call them both the beach ball stocks. Have you ever tried to hold a beach ball underwater? It always pops back up!!!!,
"@douglascoates - I’m guessing your bought back in somewhere along the line and did not tell us.  :)  Wish I had started that early, but I’m still buying.  Guessing over 90% (if not more) of these posts on SA are buyers.",
"@williamandmary2 - dead right, that's where my money is. I've been a true fan of Apple since early 90s and remain so. Very good mid to longer term but opportunities around $180 near term.Great co's don't exist in a vacuum, and the broad market sentiment and trends are really quite negative.Apple can't shock with really good news for a few qtrs going forward, so it'll drift lower.btw, I'm the guy who bought at $10 when Steve went back in and iPod just launched, sold happily at $25. With share splits factored in, maybe I'd be up a mill plus by now. So don't follow me, I am lost :)",
"Problem is the haters who have no clue on the technology or the market. Apple get over 90% of the gross margin in all categories they compete in. They have the best processor in mobile, and full control of OS.Their competition that uses Android, cannot differentiate their products, and can command little or no margin. You can dump Apple because you believe the consumers will stop spending. But, to dump them on margin, profitability, or technology grounds is really dumb.",
Apple is a cheap stock right now and will probably get cheaper before it gets more expensive a share. :-),

Why you bought more apple shares? Is because you are a SMART MAN THATS WHY!,
You are assuming everything stays constant. The smart money says we are going into a recession and Apple will be a big victim.  Nothing else you say matters.  High priced gadgets into a recession is a disaster.  The current earnings can likely go back to $5 annually. That’s where everyone is blind.  Buybacks and cash hords don’t matter in a business that hit peak earnings.,
Good thing that Apple services is killing it. I think most investors presumed peak handset/unit sales when they bought.,

Good value and with the technicals at my back.What could possibly go wrong....   hmmmm....  let's not think about that  :)",

I have owned Apple stock for 13 years now. After the split I really had a bunch of chairs that I have just not touched it and don’t plan on for a few years. . My target price is close to $300 before I cash out..It may not happen soon but hopefully within the next five years it will.

It just doesn't seem to work out like they say and those of us who are LTBH investors make out just fine.  I'm surprised that so many of the analysts stay employed with all their wrong calls.

I think the point here is valuation and time to market risk. They have the cash to complete.

List on a Canadian exchange asap through a reverse merger to save time (see Harvest Health & Harvest Enterprises).5. Apply to list on NYSE/Nasdaq.6. Cash out asap. 7. Become fabulously wealthy.

With a population of about 24k that puts the funds raised from this at about 4 million.  I'm assuming the SRA covers a much wider area so the amount of funds that would have been raised by this would be much larger....but it was suspended.Without putting the lines underground (at great expense that would have to be passed on to the ratepayers) I don't see how any organization can guarantee fire safe delivery of power to these remote areas.Plus putting the lines underground probably would not guarantee that there would not be issues as these areas are filled with critters that love chewing on insulation and generally making a mess.Yeah its not an easy problem to fix.,
"@macbolanTo your point: yeah, tough spot.  Delivering electricity is inherently dangerous.But that is exactly part of what could get PCG in the soup this time.  Just a few months ago, they announced a program where they WILL cut power under certain conditions as a preventative measure.  Huge media campaign announcing it.  They did cut power a few times, then had problem restoring all of it timely.   A lot of public outcry, according to the media.What went on this time?  (It is possible that these were major transmission lines that can't be rerouted?)   Whole point is, they acknowledged extreme danger and a plan to combat it.  For some reason that plan wasn't implemented this time.  Was it they couldn't do anything or made a poor decision because of fear of bad PR and did not do anything.On another front, fire crews were on the scene quickly when the fire is small.  (There is aerial footage).  Call for lots of help.  Clearly it did not get there in time.A few years ago California instituted a special property tax on parcels in wildland fire areas to beef up protection.   Where did the money go?   Because of poor schedule management, many firefighters routinely make as much in overtime as the do in regular pay.  Have they actually SIGNIFICANTLY increased staffing on Red Flag days?  My guess is no, because these disastrous events recur.  The money is probably still being spent on reaction instead of being proactive.   Obviously they can't keep all fires small...  but it is strange that such large swathes are wiped out without a stand being made in at least one area.(It took hours to evacuate just a few miles with people caught in traffic jams.  Conversely, that is enough time for a massive response).",

Agreed that no investment case exists here, and bankruptcy looms large.Chapter 11 off the table for awhile, revolver draw covers maturing debt and pays the bills.

Moody's guesses 2017 fire liabilities at $10B, hard to imagine the politically acceptable number for 2018 as zero.  Horrible human tragedy.Enron collapse and enormous debt loads cost Gray Davis a shot at the White House.  Incoming Governor Newsom needs to find a razor's edge, which is very sharp.  Chapter 11 could be middle path, big haircuts for debt and share holders, order restored for balance sheet, mitigate rate shocks, cover existing lawsuits, and allow the governor to show strong leadership.Unavoidable enormous share dilution at some point, reorganized governance to limit liabilities, management shakeup.

This is very well done. I plan to soon release a detailed report drawing similar conclusions. Additionally it provides an analysis of many of cvna’s metrics vs industry competitors that I think will serve to further reinforce how far afield cvna is from industry norms.,

Theft that CVNA's asset backed paper performs so well in the ABS market (once yields, very low delinquency) makes its paper appealing = more demand.

"As a doc with a lot of experience with both epic and cerner, I strongly disagree with the statement that cerner has a big moat.  Epic is vastly superior and pretty much everyone n healthcare knows it at this point. Where cerner is winning contracts is systems that are too cheap to pony up for epic or too small for epic to bother... though the latter is changing as epic achieves market saturation. Cerner probably retain its niche as second best and more affordable for The foreseeable further, but I would not put my money behind it. I expect little growth and likely some decline.",
How do you feel the change in executive management will impact Cerner?,
"Afraid the ongoing consolidation of hospital driven Healthcare delivery will be a major headwind, at least in the US. University systems and large regionals are becoming almost exclusively EPIC.  As they continue to grow, and dominate the ambulatory care market, they are rapidly outpacing Cerner.  Especially from a clinical perspective, Cerner used to be the choice.  Apparently EPIC is better at extending across multiple hospitals and across the continuim of care which has allowed them to leapfrog and extend their lead.  Note this is US, not international, at least at this point.Enough licencing and service revenue to serve them well for a long time but concerned only growth will be inflation of these fees not net-new installs.",

Very timely note. I was speaking with friends about Apple and the correction. I said the only big miss I can lay at Apple's feet is in gaming. I expected Apple TV to be the Trojan horse into dominating gaming but that's just not happened. Why all the emphasis on Metal and AR? Do you really think the iPAD is the future of Apple's gaming strategy? Maybe in the near term but I don't see them acting like this is market they want to disrupt. I hope we start seeing some leaks about the next product category. IMO it is going to be about gaming based on an AR product.,

"Excellent article.  In my opinion, expense of the iPad is not an issue for hard core gamers.

The fact that the iPad Pro can now connect to a large screen through the USB-C port and gaming consoles are already available through Bluetooth, neither of those should be an obstacle to buying the iPad.  Finally, it doesn’t hurt that the iPad is good of many other functions and tasks besides gaming.

"You argue that gaining will go to streaming which is definitely correct. But then you are arguing that a $800+ tablet is for gaming. No, it is the exact opposite.

My thought exactly!Make the announcement knowing the price would decline & bring on the share buybacks!Genius!$$$$,
Thanks for the perspective from the gaming side as I am not a gamer but I do find that the performance on the Pro model just makes it the fastest device I have and the form factor makes it easy to go everywhere. I find the obsession with number of units sales as a poor indicator of business success and I can not help but think that all this recent hype has it’s source in media manipulators. I would not be surprised if Apple itself did not have this a strategy to lower share price but stock buybacks and then at the end of year they will have such high margins the stock will got to it’s projected $250 level. Look at the Asian competitors who have much higher unit numbers recently than Apple and yet their financials are a disaster without combining all their other products...like TVs!,

Idk if you’re aware? But most ppl play it on their phones. Apple isn’t stupid. The newest gaming console is the phone because you can play it anywhere. Portable gaming is the future. That’s why they’re capitalizing on it and they’re going to have many grab it for gaming. You don’t have to drag your finger across the entire screen. No one does so on their phones. You simply use your thumb. If they’re making it a gaming machine? You better believe they’re going to create something that grabs ppl,
"Games have always been a huge portion of the app store and if you look at what serious gamers spend on their ""gaming rigs"", the iPad Pro is modestly priced by comparison.Adding AR capabilities plus facial recognition certainly opens up new possibilities for game design, as well as addiction.

Factual article and lots of comments that sound a bit irrational / emotional with emphasis on past performance. My take is that the high growth is not going to continue going forward due as the author points out to growing market saturation ... and competition... and less features and capabilities differentiation.

The recent drop and lower PE testify to this I'd say.Draw a regression thought Buy&hold''s returns and it's downward sloping.This does not mean is not a good stock,
"My main takeaway from the article has nothing to do with Apple.  It is this: ""The stock has dropped a stunning 17% from its 2018 highs"". The total return of Apple is still up 15% year to date, and this author believes that a 17% drop from its all time high is stunning. My bet is this author was not investing in 2008, let alone 2000.  I did, and let me tell you, a 17% drop from all time highs is not stunning. Since the Fed, ECB, BOJ, and PBC began flooding the market with liquidity almost 10 years ago, there is a generation of investors that think stocks like Apple, Amazon, Netflix are entitled to go up 30%-50% plus per year every year.

I believe the key for Apple is the total sales per unit calculated as a sum of the unit price, the expected lifetime of services, and the tangential sales generated. How many iPads and iWatches get sold because of the original iPhone sale. I'm not smart enough to make this calculation but I expect the folks at Apple are.Meanwhile you have an army of the most talented marketing teams and engineering teams always seeking to make incremental advances and playing around to find that next new thing.If I was a conspiracy theorist I would think these drops in stock price are actually being ""manufactured"" by the big trading firms.

The problem with your multiple on future earnings is just that.  Future earnings likely to be lower than estimates.

Despite a wider variety of goods, including video games with screens that spill out onto the mall floor - the store is usually empty, with a few sad-faced clerks standing around talking to each other.

"Apple will of course remain profitable.  Most of the comments on this article seem very determined to not see apple for what it has become.  Apple has become a marketing company rather than a product/engineering company.  They sell high priced hardware because they can.  Why they can command higher prices is not completely clear but must have something to do with the superior user experience they can deliver by controlling both hardware and software.On the hardware side,  products are nice but certainly not the best.  So it's the software the gives them the edge.  At least on the mac side, the software quality is declining noticably.  As regards apple services,  I don't use any apple service and that is a deliberate choice.  So the momentum behind apple can keep it as a good investment for some time to come while management bleeds the vitality out of the company.  Thats fine for investors, for those who care about products apple is becoming increasingly irrelevant.All the real software and hardware engineering talent is going elsewhere.  If I were a top CS kid coming out of university today,  Apple would be the last place I'd hope to land.",

"Although I think you are correct, the worry is that continual ASP increases will be unsustainable at much more than inflation which won’t grow revenue much.Having said that, there is still the growth in services and in wearables that so for has not been sufficiently priced into Apple.

"In evaluating Apple, I prefer price to cash flow which is about 12 right now.  Ex-cash, the number is probably just over 10.  But adjusting for capital spending, the effective free cash flow is 8% of the share price.  If a total earnings growth rate is 5% (mostly with services and ancillary products) the total return would be about 13%.  That seems quite good for a lower than average risk investment.Long Apple.

"Another article by someone who doesn't understand AAPL and just wants to join the bandwagon of bashing AAPL after the stock already dropped by nearly 20%. It's easy to bash a beaten down stock but then again that's what all analysts do anyways. If a stock goes up, all analysts upgrade it, if a stock drops, all analysts downgrade it. Rinse and repeat. Analysts said that AAPL was a ""sell"" when it was $85 a few years ago and they were saying to ""buy"" AAPL when it was $230 a few weeks ago. Anyone who listens to analysts will lose their money as they tell people to buy at the peak and sell at the bottom. Nothing to see here.",

"Another big problem with Davids analysis here is that his focus on ROIC is being tricked by the dramatic reductions in shareholders equity, due to the stock repurchase plans.  This is simply unsustainable, and cash balances are dropping rapidly.  The company will either need to use debt financing to continue on this path, or reduce the amount of money they are using to pump the stock price.   If you blindly use ROIC, then reducing shareholder equity to near zero would lead to infinitely higher ROIC, but of course, it would also not really be increasing the value of the company at all.Another point from the 10-K is that they will need to add lease obligations to the balance sheet due to accounting rules that must be applied starting in fiscal 2019.  That probably is not a positive as it increases the liabilities and just makes some ratios look worse.  This is just an accounting issue, and not really a change in the performance of the company, but it does impact ratios that investors look at in a negative way.  Off balance sheet liabilities always make a company look leaner and less risky in a downturn.One other key point. Last quarter the revenues were helped by 22 million by an extra week in the quarter, so this quarter will see a commensurate drop in revenues for one less week.  That will make the numbers look less attractive this quarter.",
"His analysis of this retailer misses some important info. Please Seeking Alpha, dont erase this message as it is important that investors see the facts below.Just took a quick look at this one and I see the CEO has been liquidating shares in the company, sold another 100K shares in late August, leaving her only 143K shares. She had a high of 400K shares in March of this year and has been selling AS FAST AS SHE CAN!!!  That is a huge red flag.  She has basically walked away with 30 million dollars this year, all of which was options she cashed in.  Dont you think that gave her an incentive to support the stock price?Look at the changes in the balance sheet.  Cash fell by 50% year over year.  Inventories have ballooned 50 million year over year. Liabilities have dramatically increased. But the company didnt lose money, so where did all that money go?Repurchase of shares. In the 26 weeks ending August 4, the amount of stock repurchases has been 187 million.   While net income was 36 million.  How is that sustainable?So the CEO has basically been using the company's cash to repurchase tons of shares in the company, while at the same time she has been liquidating the shares SHE owns.  Hmmm.  Sounds like a short term plan to me.And why am I seeing that the results from the last quarter are unaudited?   Doesnt this raise a red flag?This is a retailer selling at a P/E of 30, EVEN AFTER the CEO used all that company cash to juice up the earnings per share number by reducing shares outstanding (to offset the shares she herself was selling).  In the past year The Children's Place has grown, but how much of the growth is attributable to ecommerce sales through Amazon?  That is a channel with very low profit margins and no real sustainable brand loyalty.   I would say it deserves an extremely low earnings multiple.This is yet again, another example of a company with very high institutional ownership, that is using lots of share repurchases and a one-time tax benefit from the tax law changes to make things look a little better than they are.   The earnings multiple is just too high.",Cutting Through The Noise To Find A Retail Gem

NVDA CUDA is closed source while AMD GPU are open source.  So techies want to tweek a NVDA GPU for AI they have to pay a team of NVDA CUDA experts to do this.

So my question now is why would AI client want to spend MORE for a GPU that requires them to beg (and pay) for help tweeking the GPU when they can spend less and get open source code help?,

"One thing about H. pylori infection is that they are like HCV, once you cure it, you don't need to treat it anymore.  Therefore, one wonders how much revenue one can generate from it.",
"Hi Zach - nice article on a lesser known aspect of Red Hill.I think that Red Hill's first anti-cancer medicine would actually probably be Talicia, a combination therapy designed to fight H. Pylori bacteria, which can cause stomach cancer and / or ulcers. Their first phase 3 trial of Talicia showed an 89% cure rate (with very low p value), better than standard of care (SOC) which was estimated at 70% initially, and suspected to be dropping over the years since due to increasing prevalence of drug resistance to the SOC drugs. Their second (confirmatory) phase 3 trial is due to report results before the end of the year (next month and half).  If we assume the second phase 3 trial is also successful, then they should be filing for approval with the FDA in Q1 of 2019. They have QIDP designation (essentially like Fast Track but for qualified infectious disease products) which should guarantee the FDA acts on it within 6 months - so possible approval near beginning of Q4 2019 (and then an 8 year exclusivity period for Red Hill).Now, since cash may be running out (or at least low) by Q4 2019, they will likely try to do a cash raise before then, maybe with the announcement of positive Talicia results here in Q4 of 2018, or with the announcement of the application to the FDA. The cash raise may provide a cheaper entry point, depending also of course on whether and how much it pops with favorable Talicia trial results. It should also be noted that they probably won't need to raise as much as most biotech companies trying to move from mostly R&D to profitable enterprises while continuing to develop their pipeline. The reasons are 1) they have a strong focus on the gastro-intestinal space, and the clinics that focus on that area are fewer in number than say cancer centers.  All their existing products (4, licensed from other firms) are in that space, plus of course their Talicia for H. Pylori (if approved). Because of this focus, they probably don't need as large of a sales force as other companies attempting to market their first developed drug. 2) Red Hill also already has a US sales force calling on these centers and selling their existing drugs - so those costs are already incorporated into their current cash burn (and the sales organization may be approaching break even, the losses or burn rate is mostly due to ongoing clinical trials for opaganib, Talicia, Crohn's Disease, etc.). But since they already have a sales force, and those costs are already included in the $10M burn rate, the costs of giving the salesmen an additional unique drug to sell into the same clinics should be rather minimal, and might be less than the savings from no longer needing to run Talicia / H. Pylori trials (meaning burn rate might go down due to being past Talicia trials even before the Talicia sales start up).Anyway, gastric cancer can be nasty, and H. Pylori is one key cause of that kind of cancer. Existing treatments for H. Pylori infection may have a greater than 30% failure rate, mostly due to the bacteria having acquired drug resistance to SOC. Red Hill's new treatment, if the confirmatory phase 3 trial is successful and the drug is approved, will probably be Red Hill's first anti-cancer treatment, with a more-likely-than-not approval within a year. Opaganib is much earlier stage.",

The word stock can be singular or plural in this usage.The Warren Buffet quote is a paraphrase by you because it's ""come"" not ""came"" and the word ""distinct"" does not adequately express his point. ""come up with distinctly different figures"" would be more appropriate.The Peter Lynch quote needs a colon (although I think it should be a semi-colon) before ""they think the price will rise"", according to a quick search.Lastly I would imagine almost everyone has big winners and otherwise and to single out a few rather than give a complete list of all recommendations does not prove anything and if anything diminishes one's credibility.

Since Juul accounts for the lion share of e-ciggs and is absolutely on fire sales wise the FDA would look very heavy handed going after them if they didnt look tough on big tobacco.If you think the big tobacco players didnt have anything to do with Juul pulling flavors indirectly though the FDA you are fooling yourself.30 year veteran of wholesale and retail businesses that sell tobacco products(among many other things)",
brexit is causing funds and ETFs to flee anything related to british exposure.  so I think bti is getting unfairly punished since less than 5% of their rev comes from great Britain.I also think that a weak pound is good for this company which has come down a lot since the first half of year. they were predicting a 6% currency drag.

Zero % would be that the ban does not occur or if Menthol smokers all switch to another BTI product.  5-10% is my guess to the yearly revenue loss in 5 years time.  BTI is paying nearly 8% divi right now and will likely continue to pay it even if revenues decline 5-10%.  It looks to me as if the Market is pricing a total loss of revenue from Menthol and there is that Brexit thing hang around, too.  For US investors, the strong dollar is a factor.

"How will this ban affect the creation of new nicotine users?Most people who already smoke cigarettes will continue to smoke other cigarettes, even if their favourite brand disappears.But menthol cigarettes is portrayed as a gateway drug, making it easier for inexperienced smokers to pick up the habit of smoking.Many heavy smokers switch to menthol cigarettes when the heavy breathing, coughing and sore throats start to be to taxing. I have known quite a few people who have switched to menthol, instead of stopping smoking, although here in Sweden it is much more common that they start using smokeless tobacco products, mostly our traditional moist snuff. (And the ban of sale of menthol cigarettes was in effect in Sweden last year.)If this ban has the intended effect and cause old cigarette consumers to disappear faster than new ones is created, then, in the long run, this ban will have a larger effect than 25% less sales for BAT, and even cause less sales for tobacco companies that doesn't market or produce any menthol cigarettes, or even cigarettes at all. Although, it might have the opposite effect. The sales of moist snuff (""snus"" in Swedish), was banned in Finland some years ago and after it was banned, the number of users went up, even outside the ethnic groups in Finland that have traditionally used non-smoking tobacco products (Swedo-Finns, Finnish Russians and Finnish Tartars). This is made easier since in Finland, it is pretty much risk free to smuggle ""snus"" from Sweden, sell it on the black market or even use it in public. Production of Finnish ""snus"" brands have moved to Sweden and Russia.",

As an insight it's worth way more than a dozen analyst reports (SFC excepted of course !).Unlike a lot of AMD followers they don't come across as obsessing about Intel - they have their own vision and roadmap, and pursue that with real commitment.I don't much listen to what the INTL guys say here these days - I don't believe much of it, I am convinced there are hired 'social media' teams working INTL on these forums, and there's a fair bit of bull floating around. For all that, INTL just comes across as a bit of a giant tanker that takes a while to change course.All this talk of AMD taking share is not where AMDs head is at really. I think their game is to win customers with excellent products and value. Taking share is just a bi-product of that.www.anandtech.com/...",

I think they are positioning their DC GPUs better. Smaller, cheaper, but capable of working in mGPU environments for HPC and virtualization and thus be more powerful overall. Those markets aren't at the kind of risk that @Akram's Razor has pointed out in the AI market from ASICs that NVDA will have problems with.Maybe AMD has a better idea of what GPUs are best at and should focus on, in tandem with CPUs, rather than trying to push GPU everywhere as NVDA does.",
The CEO is the X factor for AMD. It’s a steal at these prices.,
"INTC is HUGE and has a HUGE skew of products most of which AMD doesn't compete with (for now).  NVDA is HUGE and has really really really expensive Turing GPU for little processing gain and no gamer optimization for Ray Tracing.  AMD does CPU and GPU and so much more.  AMD, NVDA and INTC are all competing in an EXPANDING TAM for AI and Cloud.  The key metric to use for the next 2 years to distinguish who comes out ahead in this competition is not total CPU sales or total GPU sales but who is acquiring the higher percentage of this expanding TAM.  Old technology makes money today as an example, INTC is moving some 14nm wafer production back to 22nm to meet wafer demand. Three, five or even seven years from now the TAM customers acquired today will be the customers buying in the future.  INTC and NVDA over charged TAM while they were monopolistic suppliers. These TAM customers have a vested interest in making sure AMD succeeds.  It was amazing to me that AMD Cloud computing will save customers 10% who decide to use AWS Cloud computing service.

"Please be careful investing in AMD. Very risky stock that has had two years of FUTURE optimism priced in. Details below.I. On Intel's (INTC) ""failure"" to move to 10nm• Intel is shipping its 10nm chips in Lenovo and NUC computers right now. A patent firm tore one down and wrote a 20 page paper on it, and proclaimed it at least as good as competitors anticipated 7nm. www.techinsights.com/...• Intel has reorganized its TMG (chip manufacturing) arm to make sure no hint of a delay ever happens again www.oregonlive.com/...II. On AMD's (AMD) anticipated Rome 7nm server chips• On 11/6/18, AMD tested how one 64-core Rome chip can do vs. two 28-core Intel 8180 Xeon chips, and the performance was equal (Rome finished the C-Ray benchmark in 28 seconds, the two Xeons did it in 30 seconds). But this shows you that AMD is still more than 2 years behind Intel in per-core performance -- because Rome won't be released until mid-2019 and the Xeon 8180s were released mid-2017. So 64 mid-2019 AMD cores are equal to 56 (2x28) mid-2017 Intel cores. www.servethehome.com/...• Incidentally, Lisa Su knew exactly how much power the Rome chip pulled on the above demo, but she refused to disclose that information.• The Rome chip has a gigantic and wasteful 14nm die in the middle that does zero processing but sucks power. It's only there to act as interconnect. Poor design. www.anandtech.com/...• Intel's 28-core Cascade Lake beat AMD's 7nm Rome for the 2019 35 PFLOPS supercomputer: ""We took a look at AMD Epyc, both Naples and certainly Rome but with the combination of price, schedules, and performance, we felt like Cascade Lake was the way to get the best value right now."" www.nextplatform.com/...• AMD's anticipated 7nm producer, Global Foundries, just said they wouldn't proceed with AMD's fab. On that same day, their top ""senior vice president and general manager of the Computing and Graphics Business Group""Jim Anderson left. Why would you leave a rising company? www.pcworld.com/... AMD is now tied to one supplier, TSMC, which is not a good negotiating position.III. On AMD's latest Epyc chips. • These are a power disaster. The red bars on this graph are wasted energy. The reason it's so inefficient is that Infinity Fabric is power hungry. This is a problem because Infinity Fabric is AMD's way of implementing a bunch of cores on one chip. twitter.com/...• AMD is still two years behind Intel in terms of per-core performance. For example, earlier this year, AMD bragged about overclocking its latest chip to 6ghz across all eight cores. wccftech.com/... Intel's latest 9900k was just overclocked to 7.6ghz across all eight cores. www.youtube.com/... IV. On the recent stock price increases. AMD has not lifted revenue, earnings, market share or other guidance since its 2Q call. In other words, the price increase since then is not based on material new information.• Remember FOMO. static.seekingalpha.com/...• Cowen upgraded AMD to $30 based on $1.75 EPS and $10 billion revenue, which is aggressive and unlikely. AMD is almost at $30 now on pennies of EPS and much less revenue. www.streetinsider.com/...• Bank of America upgraded AMD to $35 based on $2 of EPS. www.reddit.com/...• AMD will probably have $0.12 (12 cents) of EPS the next two quarters. finance.yahoo.com/...• Some think the analysts have secret information that the public doesn't know, but that's impossible. AMD would violate SEC Regulation FD by doing that, and there's no reason to give analysts secret information that you withhold from investors. www.investopedia.com/...• Some of the upgrades are clearly unserious. Hans Mosesmann (success rate of 57%, the same as flipping a coin www.tipranks.com/... upgraded AMD to $30 on August 23, and then upgraded it again to $40 on September 11 (three weeks later) with nothing new in his report. www.cnbc.com/... and www.marketwatch.com/...V. AMD is run poorly, because the repeatedly fail to capitalize on opportunity• Demand for chips is skyrocketing in 2018. Intel capitalized on this and grew revenue from $62.8 billion in 2017 to $70 billion in 2018 (the $70 billion number is a current estimate and could easily go higher). www.intc.com/...• Notice Intel grew revenue by at least $7 billion as a result of the 2018 chip boom. AMD's entire 2018 revenue will not be $7 billion.• The 2018 chip boom was a wonderful opportunity for AMD to really grow. They claimed to have outstanding chips available, and should have capitalized by growing revenue by billions. But they did not. The benefit of the 2018 chip boom all went to Intel.• While Lisa Su and AMD are giving interviews to Jim Cramer, Intel is out there capitalizing on every morsel of opportunity, as a well run company should.VI. On AMD's cash cow (graphics). It just lost to NVDA which revolutionized GPUs by implementing ray tracing on popular games. No serious gamer can see this video and not want an NVDA RTX, which is completely sold out on preorders. www.youtube.com/...• Incidentally, Intel dominates GPU in terms of market share (via its in-CPU graphics processors) www.extremetech.com/...VII. On the future and innovation. Intel continues to plug away . . . AI, FPGA, driverless, 5g/wireless, advanced memory, quantum (yes really www.youtube.com/... ). If the past is any guide, when Intel makes money on these others will jump on board with ""me too"" but by then Intel will be onto the next thing.• FPGA.

AMD has lost key personnel like Raja Khoduri, Jim Keller, Greg Stoner, Jim Anderson and others.• Best Workplaces. www.greatplacetowork.net/...• Fortune Best Companies to Work For archive.fortune.com/...• Working Mother Best Companies www.workingmother.com/...IX. On political and trade risk. AMD has huge political and market share risk due to a JV that allows Chinese companies to sell Epyc clones. The history is below.• In August 2015, the U.S. barred Intel (and implicitly AMD) from selling high-end server chips to a few (but not all) Chinese customers due to national security concerns. Intel complied. www.pcworld.com/...• A few months later, China went to Lisa Su to get basically the same chip from AMD via a complicated joint venture that complied with the letter of the law -- because the chip would not be sold by a U.S. company but would rather be sold by the Chinese JV (so no need to ask the U.S. for permission to export it to Chinese customers). www.forbes.com/...• A month ago, China started producing these Epyc server chip clones. As this article explains, they have a different name but are EXACTLY Epyc chips. www.tomshardware.com/...• The U.S. government is due to publish a report on Chinese theft of U.S. semiconductor IP that could name and shame AMD. ""ASSESSMENT OF THE U.S. INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY"" www.reddit.com/...• Based on the timing, it's clear the ONLY reason this JV was set up was to circumvent the government's ban.• These chips will be in the hands of those very customers the U.S. government said couldn't have them.• They will be taking market share from Epyc and only paying AMD a tiny royalty, instead of the large margins it would have made on Epyc.",

"This is a joke! You're using potential revenue numbers for the datacenter from Intel. Intel sold multiple low core CPUs for very high margin. AMD will  be selling single processors with tons of cores for a discounted price. AMD's marketshare revenue of the datacenter won't be anywhere near Intel's. You're using the wrong numbers. Additionally AMD is far from a bargain and is still a HIGH RISK STOCK. If Intel was to come out and say they will be releasing a competitive 64core chiplet design by end of 2019 or early 2020 AMD would plummet. The stock is sitting currently on a PE of 60+ That means people are grossly over-projecting profits that have yet to come. X86 demand in Q3 is the highest it's ever been and Intel is guiding up for Q4.

Anyone have an estimate for 1Q and 2Q Rev for ADMP from Novartis alone?,
Well written article on ADMP but the share price today has dropped to only $2.06 a share ( 26/3/19 ),
Again all bad news and situation have been priced in. The only thing we can do is to wait for good news arrival. Maybe Dr carlo is to retire...who knowsDefinitely add if see sell-off,
Glad to see sandoz price the symjepi at a sixteen percent discount to teva and mylans products. I firmly believe sandoz was waiting on the teva pricing before launching the symjepi. It seemed to me that they were looking for pricing stability in the market before the launch. Imo This is on track to launch now that sandoz has stated proving and launch timing. Notice I'm saying sandoz snd not ADMP. I am going by their timeline. Good luck to all,
"It’s not that bad. What’s a few more months when you’ve waited forever. Sure dilution is imminent but it stings less the fourth time. In fact, to let the world know you will start sometime early q1 just shows there’s a definite plan (+- 1 1/2 years). It could all be a ruse and fluff to protect stock price and there really won’t be more than a half hearted effort to market this. It could all be window dressing if Sandoz just wanted the rights to Symjepi for another product. They would save thousands on the backs of Admp investors. It’s cool though just saying “Symjepi” out loud, fast , with an accent or with your mouthful. I’d love a commercial ad to run during Super Bowl of gramma administering the “Symjepi” .... while Carlos and the BOD are in the background ( giggling like school girls..cause they are rich). Your sales slogan could be ... “Symjepi easier to use then say”",
"lol. This news is basically an Update stating that the launch is delayed again until next year. From Q4 2017 to Q1 2019. Isn't this awesome for such a revolutionary product not to launch for almost 2 Years. Aside from that why should the managment be trusted when the entire year they have been screaming that working closely with Sandoz to launch 4Q and last year it was 4Q 17.  To top it all off, shareholders never I guess adamis management a hard time and just took their words for it. Had there been a lawsuit after the first delay, I am sure that we would have been standing at a much higher and transparent point.This delayed Launch just comfirms that DILUTION IS IMMINENT, The ROCKET was busted at the platform, The $5 stock that could not be $10, and its not time get On BOARD.   Maybe when this management leaves, products are launched, with sales numbers, this will be a  well understood stock. Until then, I consider this as a BIG SCAM just to pay executives.",
We have a move on Symjepi from Adamis finally !!!,
"So about Feb should be on shelf.Stock is underreacting due to market crash today, I bot some more here.",
Congratulations finally lol. I’d sell on the pop though. Imo,
Sandoz did get marketing approvals to market Sempeji,
Is that a cricket I hear from the authors camp?.... quiet now.... my bad “it’s the big lady” singing. I called Sandoz today and all they could offer after a lot of prodding is “hopefully by year end 2019”. That’s ineffective imho,
"Biologics it is one thing to compete in a market where supply doesn’t meet demand but to compete when the market is saturated ( which it will be in a few months because Teva will be able to supply the production) is another. So, the longer this Symjepi launch takes the harder it’ll be.”Fumble” the Street cries.... I am honestly beginning to think it’s not going to happen. Sandoz paid a small fee to be in collaboration and then Teva got approval. The opportunity has passed and they are to big to screw around for low margin/low market share. Are they even producing products for a launch? Haven’t heard zip.",
There is a huge shortage in the market and has been for awhile. Teva is priced just right. It’ll sell all it can produce and get to the shelves. Boom that alone will gain Teva big market share the first few quarters! Symjepi is no threat cause it isn’t on the market....any idea when it will be?,
"Stan great info in your comment. Still wondering if you’ll supply an answer to the questions I asked in your last comments. It’s the big “elephant” in the room. There’s been a shortage in the market the past few years...Admp has had approval the last 1 1/2 years, you claim their device is superior and teva/atrs did it in less than 3 months. I’m convinced there running into roadblocks they are not divulging... but if you talk to the company regularly and your so convinced it’s all good.... I wouldn’t turtle if asked direct questions.",
"Lol I'm always a little skeptical of folks claiming to be ""educators"" on an investment site. I've done my numbers, know the market pretty well, and made my long bet. I might add it's a good sized bet which could have bought me a beach house. But I talk to the company at least monthly and cultivated a network of analysts and docs for each of my HC names and feel good about the quality of my info. So I don't need any ""education"" thanks.This year has been a bad year for development-stage HC stocks across the board. For example check out PARP Inhibitor stocks TSRO and CLVS. Both worse than ADMP. Lipid company ESPR has been crushed despite good data. But market weakness creates opportunity for investors in companies who successfully build out their pipelines. When you guys have something besides innuendo and conjecture please let me know. Until then I'm sticking with my projected approval dates, launch dates, revenue & profit forecasts, and discounted valuation targets. Btw, anyone with even the most basic knowledge of financial math knows you don't value a development-stage company on next year's forecasts. Good luck shorts, you're gonna need it.",
"blue-mace - Bingo! Spot on.You have to wonder why a PhD who has spent his almost entire career (btw he is 76 year old) & achieved ""NOTHING"" meaningful suddenly tries to develop a commodity syringe & calls it ""platform technology"". And analyst community jumps on the bandwagon to offer investment banking services. SYMJECT is nothing but a fancy commodity syringe injection.Adept pharma was acquired for $735 M by EBS for it's FDA approved NASAL SPRAY drug delivery platform which is very easy to use. I dont see that kind of advantage with SYMJECT which is a commodity syringe. My prediction is the Needle Fear factor will shut down 85%-90% of the market for SYMJECT. (Edited)",
"For Adamis to trade at $8-$10 price range, they need revenue of at least $80-$100 million in the next 12-18 months. I predict first year revenue of SYMJEPI to be $10 M.I predict at least one CRL for Naloxone before approval and timeline will be pushed until 2020 for approval.I predict Sublingual tablet results will be disappointing prompting Adamis to abandon development plan.",
"The market is going to be huge for autoinjector and the many products it can deliver “at home” or outside of a hospital visit in emergency situations. Anytime you can avoid hospital visits “for shots” that’ll only reduce health care costs overall. There is no doubt this space has growth.                                   The mistake Admp investors and this author are making is; recognizing the opportunity and investing in that opportunity not “the company and device”. There is a reason Admp has not launched since fda approval a year and half ago. You can blame Carlos all you want and we can ignorantly say “he didn’t even pick up the phone and make 1 call” after approval. Of course they tried..and tried but ran into nothing but road blocks. Fast forward a year and they cut a 50/50 deal with Sandoz (oh my that’s horrible deal you say...Carlos is a fool). It’s more of a reflection of the difficulties and thoughts Sandoz can make this work.But, six months after Sandoz/Admp collaboration...still no launch. (Keep in mind. Teva/Atrs injector approved Sept- product launched Nov).          Here’s the difference. Admp product is perfect for “professionals”. But, there isn’t a doctor in the Nation who will prescribe that delivery system to the general public. The fear of lawsuits. Kudos for Admp for getting fda approval but they “cheaped out” and didn’t spend time/ money to create a device that would be acceptable for general public...thus limiting their target market. Look at Pfizer who was developing their own delivery device (similar system as admp) but abandoned it to cut a collaboration deal with atrs....Pfizer made the right call Admp didn’t.     You see getting approval for “autoinjector” takes longer and is more difficult but it’s the future.. not prefilled syringes and needles ( it’ll never fly or at least ever be widely accepted).    Note: I have no problem administering my own needle to myself/others but don’t think 90% of the population should ever be put in a situation that they have too when a loved ones overdosed/gone into shock. Look, dont bury your head in the sand ... why 1 1/2 years no launch?",
You are right yesterday's spike in the price says the same thing👍👍👍,
"I've mentioned before that ~15% of scripts go to the professional market...first responders, emergency rooms, urgent care centers, etc. These folks are trained to give shots and will value the smaller form factor, ease of use, greater reliability, and lower cost. I think that 15% will provide a floor for market share in a few years, with additional upside coming from consumers who value these same attributes. And after massive recalls of both Auvi-Q and EpiPens, I can definitively say I would NEVER choose an autoinjector over a reliable prefilled syringe.",
They will announce launch soon however they will not be  able to sell much. Market is crowded with EPI devices and more competition is on the way very soon. Why would anybody in their right mind want to pay $200 for a commodity syringe injection when autoinjectors can be purchased for half that price. Its a no brainer.,
"Symjepi will never take more than a 15% market share at most and that’s if they sell it dirt cheap. Autoinjectors are way safer for the public. Their target market will be $100 sales to hospitals and trained health care workers...not really seeing it fly anywhere else. How is everyone soaking in Symjepi being fda approved “over a year ago” and partnership with Novartis “quarters” ago with product launch wtf knows when lol.... compared too Teva/Antares fda approval/launch all with in 3 months? Yep, ADMP will need to a few “rescue shots” in the form of stock dilution on the piggy back of “near dead” investors for years to come. Long Atrs short ADMP",
Ever occur to you that it’s not a case of “management” so bad they can’t get this thing launched within a year and half after approval... they can’t get this thing launched with a heavy hitter like Sandoz taking the ball within 2 quarters when Teva/Antares have product in pharmacies in under three months after FDA approval? It is clear they aren’t launching because they will never get insurance companies on board to sell to the “general public” with a “needle” delivery system. Their market is to “hospital” emergency rooms and trained professionals.... a big market in itself but small compared to what Teva autoinjector will capture. For so many of you who comment but don’t do enough research... Buy Teva if you like but I think Atrs (with injector patents) is the long term win!!!!,
TEVA's AB generic EPIPEN price reflects confidence that SYMJEPI will NOT be able to encroach their territory even on price point. They can continue to take advantage of lack of autoinjector competition and autoinjector is what almost all retail consumers prefer.,
"I believe that pricing is based on Epi pen shortage. Why sell it for cheap when there is not enough supply. Not everyone is as Crook, sneaky, and stupid like adamis that wasted almost 6 Months of revenue, $3Million in lost inventory, and no upfront payment. However, once the epi pen supply resumes to the point where there is no near term shortage, I am sure they will change it to a Volume/ low price game. The good News on our end is that we still have ZERO Revenue. With last two weeks in holidays, I am assuming that U.S compounding will do Magic sale to get 30% Increase in Revenue. I wonder if management will ever find their Integrity.",
"I just can't understand how you can defend Adamis & Sandoz given how long it has taken them to bring the product to market. Sandoz will be fine, regardless of  when SYMJEPI is launched. However, it does significantly impact Adamis stock & its shareholders in the short term & longer term as well.",
"Apparently, James W. Burke has stopped writing ADMP articles as soon as SIO capital sold all their ADMP shares. Makes you go..hhhmm...",
"Make no mistake, stock will get a bounce once the SYMJEPI rollout is announced and pretty sure those who have been stuck in it (with cost basis of $4s & $5s) will look to exit for good.Stock will head back to low $3s or $2s soon afterwards.",
"@johnford Assuming you are correct: what comments/analysis do you have if Symjepi does in fact get launched/sold? Is there a path to success for ADMP evne in light of the negatives? Seems to me the best aspect of ADMP is that Sandoz is in charge of Symjepi . . . old/incompetent Carlo is not in the driver's seat, a competent company is. . .",
"The way Adamis is continuing to bleed investor money on developing unsophisticated generic products that has ton of competition and very low margins, frequent dilution will eventually erode shareholder value completely & probably bankrupt this company. Remember, In 2013 this was an OTC penny stock trading at $0.25 and Carlo did 1:14 reverse split to ""make it look good"" & uplisted on NASDAQ. Since then they have been diluting the heck out of common shareholders who have unfortunately become bagholders.",
"I find your analysis quite extensive and convincing. I will add ADMP to my watchlist, but it feels as though I might have missed the entry point. I expect TEVA launch to cause a spike down for ADMP, especially if it happens first, and I will use that as an entry.",
"Adamis pipeline progress, prospect and timeline will not add value to its stock price until they actually start generating revenue. Sandoz is partner or SYMJEPI but that does not mean they will save Adamis. Nope. I am confident Adamis is going to significantly underperform in 2019.",
"I'm posting this Naloxone video for anyone who missed 60 Minutes last night....very powerful. It's worth noting $50M revs Narcan was acquired by Emergent BioSolutions (EBS) in August for $635M plus a $100M earnout. ADMP's Naloxone syringe will be more user friendly and more efficacious, and will likely drive much higher revenues. My $8-$10 SOTP estimate is conservative indeed. www.cbsnews.com/...",

"""The primary clinical benefit of SYMJEPI is that it has no internal parts to fail like an auto-injector."" That's just plain wrong. I dont  know why many people try to make it sound like SYMJEPI is some kind of magical device that will never fail.Know this - SYMJEPI prefilled syringe is a mechanical device. Patient MANUALLY has to  push the plunger. So, there are mechanical part connected to make the plunger push the liquid in it to  the needle.

What surprises me most from the article is that no mention is made suggesting that Novartis is supplying ADMP with any working capital.  If the product is so potentially valuable to Novartis, why aren't they moving heaven and earth to get it to market.  Has anyone read Novartis' press releases and reports to see if they even mention distribution plans? Mary",

Kudos to you Biologics.",
This article was so good that today it gave us more than 11% increase in pps. One article like that every week until they announce the launch and we will be great.,
I bought the stock thinking this was a license to print money.I intend on following the author's advice on this one.@gandc,
"The bottom line is SYMJEPI was approved almost 18 months ago, and it is STILL not on the market.  That's unconscionable.In the meantime, Teva's (potentially) competing product has been approved and there are generics as well.  Adamis had a chance to build an advantage by getting to market well ahead of other products, and they absolutely blew it.  I have no confidence they learned anything from this, and would not be surprised if they have a similarly abysmal roll-out of SYMJECT, assuming it gets approved.",
"detailed article written; however, it still does not make sense to the delayed launch. If the management understands that with teva's launch, we will take another hit, why more delays. And eventual launch will make sense for day traders and technical player like you, but ths real investors, the long term, were and are screwed. With all due respect, I believe that a buyout can and only buyout can save the company at this point. Otherwise, we are looking at more dilutions starting as soon as may/june 19, and then once every year as we move forward wih product advancement, and eventual reverse split. The 50% net profit still has to be seen, because as the price war starts, everything eventual will come down, and 2024 is not a model I want to follow, as prices will be different because of price war and probably will have more competitors. Now Had Carlo and his team of directors executed the plan last year or beginning of this year, it would have saved a lot of money for everyone. As far as Nax goes, we will see about the adcom meetings..till then its just speculative...I just never understood as to why all these bullish articles come out as the price tanks, and each time analyst suggesting a different date. Sometimes it appears to be that articles are secretly written to tell investors another lollipop DATE. For example, Bret Jensen expected it to launch in 17. Then John agle article came to tell us to expect the dates in the beginning of 2018. When investors waited in march, another article came to push it to another quarter. Now with your article, you are suggesting early next year lol. I have no doubt in my mind that in Feb, 2019, an article will come out to expect launch in 2half of 2019 stating that a launch willl happen once Novartis split its business.At this point, I dont see anything but small spikes for day traders and short investors. Longs are pretty much screwd with their $5 stocks. Now its a different story that the stock tanks to 50 cents and then jumps to $1 and I call it 100% profit. Once again, for the short term investor.  If waiting 20 years get to $10, I apologize, there are better companies out there. I honestly want the lawsuits to start find out what exactly happened, as I only see more and more dilutions, with minimum help from a cheap cheap generic syringe with split 50% NET profit(Once again, Net profit) and no demand data in sight...",
"Wow this is a long article.   That is a lot of time to invest in adamis pharma, a bio concern located in the enclaves of San Diego.  My main question is why such conservative price targets?   Many targets range from $7-$12 but based on Carlo’s track record and potential here we have the opportunity to see $20-30 pershare no?",
Another attempt to pump-up this fraud company. Seeing these articles since 2014 and since then whoever invested money in this crap has lost all of it. Think thrice not twice before putting your hard earned money in this crap.,
"Excellent analysis. But the bottom line is that the share price is wholly dependent on the speed with which NVS brings the product(s) to market. It is out of ADMP's hands.But, in any case, the other bottom line is that ADMP has little downside risk compared with upside reward. Also, judging by the ages of the Chairman and President (74 and 75, respectively), I believe they could be open to a buyout offer. They are not exactly spring chickens and might wish to cash in while they can. A buyout by NVS is a reasonable possibility. Alternatively, if the prospects are as good as we believe they should have little trouble obtaining interim financing from NVS, which would negate the need for a public offering.Long ADMP (and very long NVS!).",
"Good well-balanced article. I like the battle fatigue analogy, lol. I bought large following the second CRL, and would have done much better if I had sold more on spikes. However I continue to like the product and the pipeline, so I agree the stock is a Buy at these discounted levels. One point I would add is that CMO Ron Moss joined in Feb 2017 and has dramatically improved the company's ability to move products through the pipeline. Another point to note is that ~15% of EpiPen scripts are to the pro market. I think that will represent a floor to Symjepi's market share, so street peak share estimates are likely way too low. On balance this is a really well written article. Thanks!",

"According to Yahoo data, of the last 4 FYs, peak revenues for RAIL were $772 million in FY 2015.  The Yahoo estimate for 2019 is $356 million.

"As RAIL works its way through its manufacturing restructuring, its positioning should be viewed in the context of a very positive macro rail car manufacturing environment.  Railway Age November issue article “Building Surge Coming” described the positive railcar-building market dynamics, quoting Cowen analyst Matt Elkott, “We are raising our 2018 and 2019 North American railcar industry production to approximately 53,000 units and 56,000 units, respectively.”This morning competitor TRN raised its 2019 guidance and initiated an accelerated share buyback.The railcar manufacturing cycle is in a definite upswing, and RAIL’s initiatives to position itself as a competitor in many new car types should lead to meaningful market share gains. Its two production facilities are operating at a fraction of their capacity, offering huge upside operating leverage as their order book fills up.With RAIL shares trading near liquidation value, it might even be of interest to strategic or financial buyers. Last month, competitor ARII was acquired in a private equity deal at nearly twice book value. Lastly, RAIL’s historic position as a coal car manufacturer is frequently mentioned as a negative, but coal still accounts for nearly 32% of all US railcar annual loadings. Despite the politics of coal, the business is not going away.",

3rd quarter report coming very soon. May be interesting...,
"from layoff site.  Guess all 4 parts aren't worth so much!Tomorrow is our last day for our Shop Your Way call center. Dozens have already left as they temporarily and gradually forward more and more of these calls to Sears/Kmart customer service call centers. We've already been telling members to use online chat because that will be the last and only platform to support remaining SYW questions and issues, and that was offshored a long time ago.SYW members are not going to be happy because the online chat services have to put in a request to adjust points and fix other problems, but as far as I can tell, after 11/30 there is nobody left to do that. Members who were identified for membership violations already have no one left to speak with to unlock those accounts because they were all laid off in October, but our manager has told us to promise members it would be taken care of even though she knows it won't. So we have been actually trained to openly lie to our members.They have not told us SYW is being discontinued but it seems to be because all of my contacts in HE where I used to escalate issues are all gone or reassigned. Also, I was told by HE the marketing budget for SYW was zeroed out after the bankruptcy, which would account for declining call volumes among new members, but this could also be because the remnants of SYW are being attached to something else.I have a new job starting 12/3 so I have a smooth transition, taking calls for a cable company which should get me yelled at equally as loud as my time here. I hope my colleagues were as lucky. By to all!",

"“I contend that some of the profitable parts of Sears are we collectively worth at least $50 a share as a going concern (before any dilution)”“1. SYW”It’s a loyalty program.  In essence, deferred payments are ponzi schemes where you need more members to pay existing members.  The fact the SYW has like a $300M liability should tell all SYW member should redeem all your points now and shred the card.   SYW is in financial ruin from the deferred liability.  I can bet those points will be burned and worthless and SYW will be cussed industry wide and all employees fired and wipe that history. No one will take on this ponzi scheme at this point, Its worth is negative.  Programs that relies on more members always end up the same way.  SYW is upside down.   “2. Sears Reinsurance”Insurance business is state regulated.  What you are describing is just an insurance on sears own insurance policies.  An insurance for the deductible or GAP insurance if you will.   This is not a business, its just a tax strategy before Sears lost money.    Why don't we value Sears procurement company while you are it.  “3. The Credit Card Revenue”Only financial institutions, which are heavily regulated can enter into banking transactions.  What you are describing is retail ending points that drives membership and GMV so Citibank took on the volume from Sears customers.  All retail business have those and contributes some cash, who cares.  Sears is still BK with it as the overhead is still drowning them.  You can’t separate this revenue without an actual carrots for banks (customers and GMV).  It takes billions in SG&A to operate department stores so you get a little bit back.  You won’t get much $$ as the endpoint and GMV shrinks.  Furthermore, Citi already paid Sears in the last deal upfront and they won’t be paid again for many years.  “4. Sears India”Sears has an office in India, probably some IT folks that puts thousands of products online everyday.  The value is negative.  It's just an offiice of cheap labor.""5. Sears Israel""Sears has an office in Israel, probably some IT folks that work in QC’s and service tickets.  The value is negative.  ""6. Innovel Solutions""Probably makes a little bit of $$.  But without Sears as a customer, good luck to their value.“7. The NOL's”IRC sectction 382 limitation makes it near worthless.  Companies won’t be buying Sears for the NOL’s.  A Chapter 11 will certainly change the ownership so 382 ownership change kicks in.  Upon change in control,  A 50M buy is basically 2M tax effected limit.  Who cares if you have $1B in after tax NOL’s when it takes 500 years to exhaust it.  “8. Eddie Lampert as controlling shareholder and Chairman of the Board”That is scary.

All stakeholders may take some sort of a short-term haircut, but if they stick with the investment over the longer term, the haircut will seem inconsequential.Warren Buffett used to coattail ride on the investments of Gurden Wattles.  He said in ""The Snowball"":  ""I owned Mergenthaler, I owned Electric Auto-Lite, I owned American Manufacturing.  What would cause the value to come out, that was always the question.

"The fact that GACP provided DIP financing certainly has my attention. To quote the Chairman and Co-CEO of their parent company (B. Riley) from this year's Q-3 call:""Well, there's going to be some big deals and there's a lot going on internationally as well that may not be in the market as much or as high-profile. What excites me is when we find an opportunity where we can utilize more than just the regular liquidation services. And I think there is where we have, I mean I say but it's really true, our competitors who are smart and they've been doing liquidations for a long time, I think we have a little bit of an advantage as it relates to our ability to package some investment banking services or a GACP loan or distribution among our institutional clients and our capital raise. And so I think the market is really robust right now. There are some really large ones but there's some small ones too and the transactions like the Bon Ton where we bought the whole company as opposed to just buying the inventory that's what excites me and we see a lot of that. So we will be incredibly active and aggressive.""If this thing goes to liquidation and GA Group gets involved, maybe with Gordon and/or Tiger, I'd definitely take a look at the '18 secured notes again (if they all aren't scooped up at that point). Bryant Riley stated in the same call they look for 30% to 40%+ ROI on those deals, so if they split wind-down proceeds with noteholders, there could be meaningful recoveries there. Of course, we're talking orderly liquidation, and any NOLV analysis (which I'm sure we'll see at some point) will set a floor on the recoveries — they always look ugly to those clanging for liquidation.",
"It actually wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility to give shareholders some minor stake in NewSears when emerging out of Chapter 11.  These things have come out of some creative restructurings in the past several years, especially when creditors, institutions, and pensioners have large equity stakes.  Lampert of course would be more than happy to see shareholder recovery.  Eric Moore is completely full of it, but he *could* be right for entirely wrong reasons.  Hercules oil comes to mind here.  Of course, this all presumes that Sears manages to avoid Chapter 7.  It seems to me that Lampert's game plan is to form a new company then go ahead and liquidate at some future date in a manner more favorable to his interests, but Sears' overall situation is such a basket case I have a hard time imagining that it isn't just more favorable to blow the whole thing up and starting up a new company with the vacant real estate assets, hiring new people, and organically building a new supply chain.  Surely that has to be better than funding the ROI black hole that is SHLD.  The inertia of existing encumbrances and entitlements both contractual and existential is forever going to drag the company down, and Lampert destroyed whatever value was left in the brands long ago.  Any hope of a rebuild has to start with getting rid of Patient Zero, and that's Mr. Lampert himself.  He's become Sears' own Typhoid Mary that infects whatever relationships Sears could possibly have with others.",
"The author's ""circle of competency"" recitations somehow remind me of Arthur Martinez's (former ""Softer Side of Sears"" CEO) ""Circle of Beauty"" initiative within Sears stores . . . long gone after being told repeatedly it was a brilliant and sustainable merchandising strategy.  There is a staggering number of duplicate/functionally-inactive SYW members (I'm one of them, with multiple accounts forced upon me), even though I continue to get email blasts from SYW promising more and more points in exchange for a few of my greenbacks.  The notion that back-office operations in India and Israel have substantive value if the mothership disappears is fanciful.  Great contributions by dampier and WYCO, by the way.",

The value of that insurance company is questionable.Sears is burning $5 million per WEEK in professional fees, They are also burning large DIP monthly interest expenses (Note new Jr  $350 m is L+11.5% -also a 3% fee.

"If Buffett had never bought that textile mill, all else being equal, the only thing missing would have been the name of the company, and there would have been a lot of financial gain from avoiding the mill's chronic losses. Buffett and Munger's company was transformed in spite of the textile mill, not because of it. The mill was liquidated for some fraction of its book value, and it was the other parts of the company that had value.Acquiring GEICO was a completely different story, but there's no comparison between Sears Re and any of Berkshire Hathaway's insurance (or reinsurance) companies. For one thing, it's not as though there's ""float""  from Sears Re that Lampert uses for investment purposes.",
Thank you for another great read.,
Syw is gone!!!!   No one bought it!!!   The people who ran it.... GONE!!!!  NEXT!!!!!!!,
!. More false analogies.2 Apparently SYW staff was gutted the last two days in layoffs,
"I'm sorry but this is one of the most naive articles I have seen on here in a long time. The author really doesn't understand what SYWR is and what it is not. In short, it is a gimmick designed to push sales activity up so that the company can blunt poor sales numbers. What it never was was a serious revenue generator. In fact, the company gives away hundreds, if not thousands of dollars of merchandise to the eager beaver members of SYWR who will take free stuff all day long. They gave away perpetually renewing free trials in SYWR MAX for at least five years -- no need to pay. That two-day shipping often didn't happen in two days either. Frequently, goods were shipped out from Kmart stores with whatever the store had available to use as boxes and packing material. I still have the photo of a Kmart shipment of one pair of socks that used a repurposed empty box of Keebler Fudge Cookies as the shipping container and the store's toilet paper as a poor man's tissue paper. That was CLASSIC Kmart. The in-store pickup program made use of myGofer shopping bags -- a concept that came and went several years earlier. They used the bags because they had a warehouse full of them. Other customers got items they never ordered or clothes in colors they didn't choose because the employee/store could be penalized for too many out of stock items. Two words: HOT MESS.SYWR was the brainchild of Fast Eddie, and his minions held guns to the heads of associates to push people to enroll. When there were quotas, more than a few associates grabbed the nearest phone book and started enrolling people at random. If you carefully examine the metrics, you will find that the vast majority of SYWR accounts are inactive and have been for years. Many were never used. There are also eBay resellers and other scam artists that created dozens of accounts to collect more points to get more free stuff to resell. Those accounts are not legitimate either. In fact, SYWR has to invest a lot of money identifying and banning those fake accounts -- it is the only shopper reward program I know that bans first, asks questions later.SYWR also alienates its customers, either when they are mistakenly banned (having a phone number associated with multiple older accounts, using the same IP address for multiple account sessions, etc.) or when other customers are stuck at the already slow registers as the person in front argues with the cashier over points and offers that don't work properly.In fact, Sears.com and Kmart.com and their stores are notorious for redemption problems. Points offers don't work, don't get loaded to the account properly, are rejected for no apparent reason, or are simply inaccessible. Long standing members don't even bother contacting Sears anymore about point problems because they know more will be on the way next week. I agree SYWR is worth $1 billion --- in surprise points or FREECASH, as they now call it. In real money, I think not.In fact, enrolling in the program does not give Sears or Kmart any demographic information. You don't need to supply any to sign up. Your purchase history may be there, but a lot of people don't spend their own money at Sears or Kmart -- they use FREECASH and other promotional dollars and walk out with their free stuff and little else. I agree the program does keep aware consumers engaged --- if only to find out how much more free stuff they are going to get. The average shopper finds the program opaque and confusing, and most only discover its random benefits accidentally at the register or through printed coupons that spit out in big strips after buying something. Have you actually visited shopyourway.com? It is a confusing mess pretending to be a shopping portal, social network, and personal shopper contact point. It does none of those things well and most customers never use it. Like EVERYTHING else Eddie has done, he and his executives have done it BADLY. Let us count the failures:myGoferPersonal Mall ShopperAlfie the Electronic Personal ShopperConnected SolutionsRFID tagsBirthday ClubThere are many, many more. That Ayn Rand managerial atmosphere forces execs to come up with new schemes to stay noticed and compete for funding, but there is no time or care to execute the ideas appropriately and no money to market it properly. So things like Alfie, which was Sears version of Amazon Echo or Google Home, was ""on fire"" priority-wise when it was given to a development team. But when the device was finished, it ended up on store shelves for about two months with ZERO marketing, then mothballed, clearanced and gone. It was also a very stupid idea. Push a button to leave the equivalent of a voicemail message to an offshore consultant about something you want to buy and then wait for someone to type you a series of questions over several days narrowing in on what you want, and then 3-4 days later giving you a recommendation and a request to hand over your credit card number to someone overseas for items that were usually more expensive than something you could find yourself in five minutes with a Google search. How could this have failed? By the way, Alfie was magnetized because you were supposed to put it on your refrigerator. If you left it on your desk, it erased the magnetic strips on your credit cards. That's my Sears!",

"@Eric Moore I see you're still trying to catch the falling knife. Since you've been buying all the way down, what would the stock need to go to for you to break even?",

"Several weeks ago you replied to one of my comments that the real estate was worth ""billions"" - I think you mentioned $5B or some figure like that. Now, you don't think it's worth anything significant? By the way, the warrants have no value. They have no value. None at all. Regardless if SHLD exits Ch. 11 and still trades under SHLD or any other dilutive scenario.",
"On docket 729, page 93, we can see projected EBITDA using 2019 projections as proxy.For 4 months (including december the highest profitable month) :SYW : 34 millions  or around 90 millions/yearFinancial services : 15 millions or 45 million EBITDA/year.There are only 23 million members that redeemed points in the last 12 months, I think a more conservative valuation should use this number, the metrics to ""active members"" seems biased.Comparing a valuation (not a sale !) of a casino loyalty program and a retail ""cash-back"" loyalty program is not the same thing.I believe casino members may be more profitable than SYW members.Also it's possible the valuation of the ""Total reward"" program is overvalued if it was not sold.",
"Even if the items noted (SHY, etc.) have the quoted values, I don’t see how those values flow to shareholders.  This company has a mountain of debt.I am short SHLD via options",
"just saw another comment in another thread, docket 729 gives SYW ebitda, and it's actually bigger than I thought.  15 million in December, than a run rate of 6 million per month.  Being generous and assuming that will continue (since the 15 million will be highly correlated with bricks and mortar and that should shrink) that gives an ebitda of around $80 million.  Wow, that's bigger than I thought.  Although I bet there's some funny accounting there, I seriously don't see how this generates any ebitda.But it's data, and I've got honor the actual numbers that have been shared.  this program, with the bricks and mortar shrinking, let's say it gets a 5 multiple, which wouldd be reasonable considering how damaged it is.  $400 million in value.  Not bad, but nothing that will make any investor any real money.Notice how none of the other businesses you wish were solvent make the going concern list so therefore even the folks who have access to the actual data don't think there's anything there. So dead.",
speechless from reading this article,
"Eric, I admire your perseverance.  Airline and casino programs are not a comparison, since the value they give away has a cost of goods of zero.  You provided no new data, no ""deep"" research, no additional insight beyond the pretty charts of what totally unrelated industries do with loyalty programs.Let's take a look at the 4 parts of SYW:1. Rewards will shrink drastically along with retail since it's only redeemable at Sears.  Since online sales at SHLD are 7% of brick and mortar, clearly 93% of this will go away.  Oh, and their online business has shrunk by an average of about 4% per year for the past 5 years in a row.  I've pointed this out to you before and you said my research wasn't deep enough.  I have provided data on their revenue, did you?  Airlines and casinos are irrelevant to the data, this is yet another Eddie business failure.  oh, and 50 million users with 251 million in points that's like 5 bucks each.  Teeny, tiny business.  2. Marketplace - those dollars are in the 7% in the above.  The total for 1 and 2 is less than $2 billion and margins are not good on pass through merchandise.  Couple of % points maybe?3. Data, sales data is broadly available and not valuable.  4. How do you consider free shipping a business?Another water sandwich of an article.  You bite into it and there's nothing there.",
"CH11 appliance and mattress vendor issues are not allowing commissioned sales staff the income they expect in their paychecks.  Associate loses are mounting at stores.  The holiday season will create such a backlash with customers, that recovery will be very difficult.  Give it a couple weeks.",

I can tell you that in the past year, customer support is suffering due to HA sales staff leaving in droves.  The CH11 situation has made things go downhill.  A sears comeback will rely on a strong level of customer support/satisfaction.  No Shop your Way discounts/coupons/points will help.  Too many associate losses and a failing hiring plan has created a downhill spiral at the store level. Sears is in big trouble.",
Eric - Thanks for the very helpful article. I really appreciate the various comps for the loyalty program valuation - not sure I would have dug those out myself. It helps to put a lot of things into context. Thanks,
"How does SYW have any real value? The active users seem to be largely gaming the system for free/practically free stuff, so what validity does their buying data even have?",
"Eddie will do OK with his control of the debt, not his stock.  Remember when he took Kmart to bankruptcy, shareholders got nothing and Eddie came out fine with control of the bonds and ended up with sears.  I see him using debt to gain control of key parts of Sears leaving shareholders out in the cold.  But maybe you are right - good luck on this trade.",
Why would you be long the common when you can buy unsecured debt for 10 cents here? Is a 10x return not enough for you? I think your incredibly good trade in old GGP has created a  deep bias in favor of going long bankruptcy common.,

Fomoing on TGIF today and what’s up with the khrn half?,
Hey TED.    what are your thoughts about this LXRP news?  Very exciting Lexaria Bioscience Announces Partnership with Altria to Fund Research and Development of DehydraTECH(TM) Technology for Oral Nicotine,
"I bought a good tranche of 1933.  Also increased Khiron since Ted said it is the number one investment in the portfolio and bought some more Sunniva as I believe in especially their US operation.  Because Canada had a large lead and the shares of Canadian companies have appreciated, I have now ended up with 69% of my portfolio in Canadian companies.  I agree with Ted that the higher appreciation will be with US companies in the future.  Therefore, I am increasing US stock exposure.  Since the tax loss season is over, I have also bought more MedMen, Green Thumb, Origin House, MPX Bioceutical (discount to iAnthus who is buying them), and to a lesser extent, Grow Generation and Kushco.",
Anybody getting into 1933 after Ted’s recommendation?,
"Since we began investments in MJ stocks without full knowledge of the companies and due to no fundamentals available, it is prudent to sell the news (if it hints at self profiteering, repeated dilution, wild acquisitions, etc), and then consider patiently whether to get back in.That is my new MJ stock rule.",
any reason why accent industries is no trading since yesterday?,
"Hi Ted, you mentioned that you think aphria management team to be solid and also recommended the stock. After the scandal, I think you failed at your due diligence. I feel the same with sunniva. I hope readers can take their own call.",
Well I didn’t want to miss this opportunity. Just bought a large sum of SNN. I am in it for the long haul. I was able to bring the avg down considerably. So I am looking forward to a good 2019 and beyond.,
"A lot of us bought into the MJ story and then filled that up with companies in order to catch some of the frenzy up.  So at this point any story telling that doesn't jive with the original hope/dream is bad and down go all the companies.Sunniva is a stock that is under the radar and will remain so until late December - March time frame, perhaps drifting lower still, but it is a dynamo waiting to take off.  Disclaimer:  long, very long and buying more with the money I have left from selling out Aphria and Liberty Health.",
Why is Sunniva getting hit so hard. It’s right there beside Apha. Looks like it’s getting shorted.,
villagefarms.com/...,
"@Dante1118 Sounds good on many fronts although I would be a bit concerned about reconverting green houses when many of the competition are building state of the art GreenH's which yield a cGMP product with low cost and have tightly controlled growing environments.  Had you considered how Village may play out against the array of mechanized and updated grow houses that ACB, SNN, etc are building?Just my thoughts, not for or againstm",
"I still don’t get the overall lack of attention being given to Village Farms & their Pure Sun Farms joint venture. They have massive greenhouses & are experienced growers with an established distribution channel as well as a new CEO who was the Senior Vice President, Supply Chain and Wholesale, at the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), they have 550,000 sq ft growing in BC now & will have 1.1 million sq ft growing by January 2019 with an option for another 1.1M. They have huge greenhouses in Texas which they are going to convert to hemp after farm bill passes as well as partnerships in Mexico. They are one of, if not the largest greenhouse grower in the Nort America with $150M in revenue from vegetables & little to no debt. I still don’t understand how they are flying under the radar. I think their price to sales ratio is around 1.3 & the are on the verge of explosive revenue growth. This seems to be the one company that doesn’t have to grow into their valuation. Any thoughts would be appreciated",
"I’m a bit baffled by those expressing various concerns over the future direction of Sunniva. Those claiming that Canadian operations are write-offs have clearly missed the fact that those operations (NHS) represent approximately 65% of revenues just reported. Hence, whatever share value the market presently places on the company is due to Canadian revenue streams to a considerable extent. This will likely be the case for the next reporting period (Q4 2018) as well. It won’t be until the Q1 2019 results are reported that California operations come close to replacing the contribution of Canadian revenues. By that time, Canadian assets will be incorporated into the “Spinco” entity, so California operations had better be in full swing. I’m not a Sunniva cheerleader by any means. I liked their story for some time before Ted O. recommended them. At the time there weren’t many ways to play the U.S. market so I took a position. I began to question the ability of management back in July when their intention to split the company was announced. I didn’t chase the stock like others did, but I made a conscious decision to hold what I had until after management executed the spin-out plan. My reasoning is based on my expectation that – based on the respective values placed on the two new entities by MNP LLP – I may have a chance to recover my loss. Better still, I like the California story and over time I might even realize a decent return on my original investment. If not, I’ll take my lumps and move on. As an investor, It won’t be the first (or last) time I get it wrong.",
"@sceptre2016 & @mebarrett2 I agree whole heartedly with both your statements.  It's very hard to remember why one has invested in a stock when the market understanding of that company (reflected in the share price) is dynamically different.  But that's what will make you outsized gains (or losses), so I look at it this way:  is Sunniva going out of business?  (I don't think so.)  Is Sunniva working their plan?  (So far yes and I believe, after the last earnings call, they have improved it by not selling the Canadian assets since that is the only way they can ship pharmaceutical grade MJ to Europe, for example);Is Tony Holler a Bernie Madoff (possibly but probably not since he has done this before and has a track record);Is their business plan sound?  (I believe it's spot on.)In summary, they have a tremendous facility in CA and the start of one in Canada, both are valuable to anyone that is in the MJ business, should Sunniva want out and both have been de risked as much as possible. The only problem with Sunniva (that management hasn't handled or is unable to handle) is we investors got in way too early.  There are no issues that I see worth finger pointing towards Sunniva.  Like Sceptre said, start ups are very very challenging and Sunniva's is especially so, hence more reward and (more risk).GLTA and JMHOm",
"I listened to the conference call and it didn't sound that bad.  The problem is that we don't get much new information.  However, I don't think there is any reason to doubt that the California operation will perform as expected; just at a slower pace than originally planned.",
"A lot of folks are spooked and the chatter among themselves is adding fuel to the fire.It's ashame how some folks could not stomach the risk of supporting a start-up company and sold off for a substantial loss at this point, but you must always follow your gut. If you feel that Sunniva won't be a good company, sell your shares. But be advised.. if you off load your shares now, your are exchanging it with someone else who will most likely benefit huge from the value it is at now. This industry is not for the feint of heart. If you can't stomach it, sell your shares. As a Sunniva shareholder, of course i'm upset about the share price, but i also have put myself in management's shoes... and the amount of progress they have made.... its impressive and i believe we have only seen the tip of the iceberg on what will happen with Sunniva. Everyone keeps staring at the tip of the iceberg and not diving deep into the bigger picture at large.... pointing the blaming finger at everyone but themselves after only looking at the tip of the iceberg..... . This has been a roller coaster, but we all knew that going into this industry we will experience turbulence.Have you ever managed a business? Look at the hoops they have to jump through. I believe in management. I believe in what they can do. My gut says to hold and i may add even more to my position. I sleep hella good at night.. even with a substantial % loss because i believe in the management and know they are working . Deadlines have been missed and yes that's concerning but i think every cannabis company has gone thru it. Hell every company goes thru it. it's never easy folks.. but as some have said before... nothing worth having comes easy... this is not a mental gymnastic post... its what i believe in... and what i have experienced... when it comes to giving up.. people do it so much when they are so close and almost to the light at the tunnel... and i've learned my lesson to not quit when the going gets tough. we've endured too much to give up now. Onward and upward with Sunniva....... godspeed to all...This post is just not intended to upset anyone. Its a post that reflects one shareholders conviction versus others after the earnings call. Stay strong those of you who have been with this company since January and Welcome aboard to those who have gotten on-board recently. Lets hit the ground running in FY 2019",
Would be nice to hear from Ted about sunniva’s latest,
"In regards to Sunniva, the Canadian plan has been a failure.  I have not heard a reasonable argument otherwise.  The California plant seems to be moving forward but I would like to hear some dried cannabis agreements come through the pipe.  The Canadian side is and may continue to drag down the stock price.  The sooner the Canadian side is sold/spun-out the better.",
I think you misunderstood their adjusted business plan as they've presented it. I recommend taking a little bit of time to sit down and read through the outline of the next few phases. It makes perfect sense and I would go so far as to call it elegant and brilliantly conceived.,
And on top of it they got de listed from one of the over the counter exchanges to a worse one cause of share price decrease.  Nothing positive came out of this report,
"Wow right when I didn’t think things could get worse with this company.  I’m starting to doubt management and thinking of taking a heavy loss.  They have completed switched their operations in Canada without mentioning the canopy deal. Obliviously no one cared to offer them anything for their Canadian assets as they are far behind.    They decided from going from whole selling to just supplying their clients.  So, what’s going to happen with the canopy deal since they are going to be producing only 5k kilo starting jan of 2019 which I bet that it won’t start until after this date. No word on funding and no word on their biggest deal on the table and no word on any deals they are working on getting in Cali.  I think the transportation was a big waste of money and shares.  They should have used that to acquire in a different state. Overall very disappointed and longs in this company I’m sorry but we’re f Ed",
Anyone know what's happening with LXRP today? Down 12% but no news just wondering if this is the typical cannabis yo-yo scenario or if something is actually happening,
"The situation of Sunniva and Ascent is that of apples and oranges. New Cannabis Ventures reported that  ""Health Canada asserts that unauthorized activities with cannabis took place under the Company’s ACMPR license during this period. The Board of Directors has accepted the resignations of Philip Campbell, Reid Parr and James Poelzer, as officers and directors of Ascent, who were the persons directing the Company at the time."" While it is unclear exactly what ""unauthorized activities"" means, I am betting that Health Canada does not revoke the license of Agrima, but puts them under the microscope for an extended period. Perhaps it has to do with activities between their U.S. and Canadian operations. If it is revoked, then this does significantly hurt their Canadian sales and any exports to Denmark and the EU. Their operations in Oregon and Nevada should not be affected as they operate in the U.S. using the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sweet Oregon, Sweet Nevada, and now Thirty Eight Hemp. ""The Company's wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in Oregon and Nevada are legally permitted to handle hemp and are presently selling CBD-based products in those jurisdictions. When the Hemp Farming Act has been passed into law, Thirty Eight Hemp Co. plans to produce and distribute CBD and other hemp derived products throughout the United States and abroad, which will significantly expand the Company's hemp distribution.""In my opinion, the recent 60% down day represented panic selling that opened up an opportunity to place a reasonable bet. I grabbed a small stake of 5,000 shares as I believe their U.S. operations will continue as planned and that it is more likely that Health Canada does not revoke its first license.",
Hi TedThanks for all info you give to us.Would you have any news on OGRMF.Seems it’s been quite.not heard much in a while.Thanks,
"Ted, hope all is well.  What are you expecting to hear on sunnvia’s  conference call for earnings on 11/29 concerning the spin out, revenue, and most importantly what they are going to do with their Canadian assets?  I hope it isn’t as disappointing as the last one as far as clarity on what they’re doing with what I mentioned above.  I still believe strongly that sunnvia will be better off just in the US and hopefully starts a massive expansion with the money they will get from selling those assets in Canada. It’s hard to image someone will pay that much for their clinics as Canadian is Rec and as far as their property they spent 7m if I’m not mistaken I would hope for a 20 percent gain on that for the land work they completed and the ability to get it licensed easier once construction is done.  Thanks",
"The point I was making is that Sunniva and Ascent have been really big losers for me, even though they were recommended as good investments.  The old saying of not investing more than you can stand losing is apt here.   Does anyone know about the status of the US and Danish operations?",
Bad good news for Ascent. www.newswire.ca/...,
"MEOW..... Dead CAT bounce,.... The bears rule all MJ names... Short into strength...Smart money is short all MJ.... I am quite sure MJ stocks will continue there grind lower... Stilll have a long way to go downnnnnn.... Stay tuned....",
"Looking back I see that the key catalysts for MJ stocks are:1)  Legalization moves, such as Canadian legalization, US states legalizing/decriminalizing, other countries legalizing2) Capital flowing into cannabis companies (capital raises, debt financing, investments like STZ with CGC, joint ventures)3) Indications of demand, as evidenced by sales following legalization4) Cannabis drug approvals (e.g. GWPH with Epidiolix approval by FDC)This is what we see driving the bull market",
"Hi Ted,I'm wondering what you think about how institutional investment in the cannabis sector is driving out the retail side now that pot is legal. I think the big buyers are trying to corner the market by first driving the price down as much as possible in an effort to increase their ownership of shares by buying up as many shares as retail is willing to sell. It seems to me the institutions will start to have more and more control over the market as retail becomes less able to counter against the beast. Wondering what your take is on that side of things. Thanks.",
"@Steeley The S-curve is essentialy a market penetration model. The business cycle approach that Ted advocates has more to do with cycles in money allocation. You are probably aware of the the maret penetration model is mathematically modeled with some parameters that determine the S-shape. Lot of research there. PM me in case you want to know more.I approach investing by picking companies on fundamental  aspects and discounts to fair value vis-à-vis growth outlook. Uhhh, in cannabis it's admittedly more speculation based on what I consider as strategically sound companies. I try to time my purchases conform the Elliott Waves model. It seems to me that Ted's business cycle fits nicely with Elliott Waves, the latter being more specific as a sentiment indicator.",
"Hello Ted,I see that you disclosed owning 150,000 options to buy KHRN prior to going public.KHRN started trading on May 24, 2018. I have not seen your disclosure on the following articles :seekingalpha.com/...seekingalpha.com/...may you please explain why?also, do you own options of SNN or other stocks?",
"Ted, agree with others above. SNNVF is on a lot of investor minds and hoping you could also elaborate on your opinion regarding Sunniva now and your opinion on them when you first wrote about them on Seeking Alpha and in your newsletter.

"HI Ted,Really glad to see you are back and like most have said, we missed you.Thanks for all your hard work.mykiePS SNN is on a lot of investor minds so I hope you are able to shed some light on what they are planning/doing with the Canadian facility or at least when you think we may hear something from the company.  I know they are getting some help in figuring out what to do in Canada but that's all I've heard and am now quite anxious to hear SOMETHING about how that effort/strategy is moving along.",
Hi TedAppreciate your work and willingness to share your thoughts and research.Do you know about Cresco Labs and if so what are your thoughts.ThanksMark,
"Sir,I really appreciate your market cycle explanation.  As someone earlier and I agree, that Canadian companies are more advance than U.S companies.  I do not see Phase 3 for at least 18 - 24 months for Canadian companies because it has only been  one year in phase 2 for them.  Or, do you see this industry in a different light ?  When do you see American companies hitting Phase 2 or, do link both (Canadian & American) together?  Any thoughts would be great.  Thank you again for your analysis.",
"@Ted Ohashi, I have long accepted and have a deep appreciation of the cyclicality of markets/sectors. My sense is that there is a difference between where the American companies are in the cycle compared to the Canadian companies. While I agree with your opinion on the Canadian operators transitioning from the trading to the bear phase, my belief is that the American operators are in the early stages of the dynamic phase. As a result, I’ve configured my Canadian holdings for performance based on fundamentals and my American positions for dramatic M&A and geographic expansion, much like what happened in Canada from 2014 to 2018. Of course the regulatory landscape could allow for more interplay between the two groups. Until then, I think it’s appropriate for investors to distinguish where we are in the cycle based on the obvious difference between the two markets. Does this approach seem reasonable? Thx Ted.",
Thanks for the updates. I am surprised you didn’t comment on VFF with their massive greenhouse space & their short term spot pricing strategy in Canada which seems to be paying off due to the current shortages as well as their Hemp opportunities in Texas & possible MJ opportunity in Mexico. They seem to be the only true value play.  Have a listen to Tuesday’s (11/13)conference call. I would love to hear your thoughts,
"Great to see you back Ted. Your insight and professionalism have been sorely missed. What is your take on Sunniva's Canadian facility and their decision to halt its construction? Is it possible that they will sell the land, cut their losses, and focus exclusively on the U.S.? This seems unlikely given the Canopy deal, NHS, and the ability to export from a GMP facility. There are a lot of theories floating around and many of us are eagerly awaiting an update that is supposed to come in the near future from management.",
"ok heres the deal and losten up because in tired of all this whining,the author is correct insofar as the way the direction of the stocks will continue to rise. he is correct because every single indices on the planet rises the same way.  first they rise alot, then sell off then rise again past the previous price zenith.  its just common sense thats how the market has been for the past century.  because this is a new sector and there are A whipe short sellers taking advantage of volatility it will take a tad longer than a year or so for all of this to settle.  im sorry to break this news to all of you but STOCKS TAKE PATIENCE!!!  stocks go up, they go back down a little and then go up further and repeat, its how its ALWAYS BEEN.  so please can all of you knock it off.bottom line is this:  unfortunately for all of you people who have the attention span of a fly, longing stocks always works.   In this case we are the frontier of a new business and you people who dont seem to get it have to realize is trying to make money over night is a poor way to invest your money.  WE (i own #CGC #ACB and #APH to the tune of about 60k US and im down right now about 30%) all are on the cusp of a new industry that is not going away period.  it will only get larger due to demand, corporate greed, the governments greed (tax revenue) and finally the opioid crisis in the states has opened a hole where medical marijuana is going to fill.  Knock off all the whining,  if you want to daytrade do it with spy or dia or something else.  If you hold on to these stocks for the next year or more you will become very wealthy.  i know its hard to understand considering people these days have no attention span or patients but thats just the bottom line truth.  buy the friggin stocks now, (i suggest sticking to the big boys) and just relax and stop trying to get rich over night.

"Hi Ted,   Welcome back to SA!  It's great to see a new article from you.  I appreciate your mapping out of where you think we might be in the flow of cycles.  I feel like we may be in the bear phase already? But like you said, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint it exactly.I know you don't like to comment on companies that you aren't fully familiar with, but I was wondering what your general take on Acreage Holdings is?  They were listed on the CSE this morning, and are trading at about a 20% discount from their last offer pricing pre-IPO. I'm thinking that this drop-off is due primarily to the current market sentiment and the uncertainty of where cannabis is going in the near term.ACRG didn't provide any solid numbers or financial data, so I understand there isn't much to work with in that regard - but I've got to think their solid footing in the US gives them an early mover advantage since there already on the ground in ~15 states?  I'd love to hear your overall thoughts.Thanks,JC",
thanks Ted. holding the bag on snnvf,

"Ted,You give great background on these companies and have helped point me towards companies to research.  Initially I was not enamored with Sunniva, but reading a lot of yours and others pieces as well as my own research, SNNVF is on my buy list for one of these days.Along with you, I also feel there will be a substantial decline coming up; we just approach it from different directions (I like Elliott Wave and Fibonacci levels for technical analysis).  So I am always reading about companies and putting those I like on a buy list for ""after the fall"".Thanks for all of the interesting information you have authored here.  I always look forward to reading your ideas.",
"Welcome back Ted. I think you are right, but for the wrong reasons,,, correlation/causation issue..I noted early last year that we haven't seen this type of market for 90 years.. and I pointed to alcohol legalization as the model.. seekingalpha.com/... .. while bull/bear market patterns may well (or may not) mimic what we can expect, this isn't driven by typical bull/bear drivers..    First I should clarify - I consider investing to be a process where we analyze companies for future profit potential based on fundamentals of the company within the market(s) it operates in, and our projections for that company performance and the market. On the other hand, I consider trading to be where we analyze the sentiment surrounding the company and what is likely to drive the company stock higher or lower - market and company fundamentals are merely one input into that evaluation.In the cannabis market, we have no market fundamentals, because we have no reliable data for a market that doesn't yet produce it, and hence evaluating a company's performance; plans, structure, etc. for an ambiguous market is likewise ambiguous -  the concept begins with ""IF.."", not ""IS"" or ""WAS:. It's not investing when the major fundamentals all begin with ""IF"".The more appropriate model for cannabis is the Business Cycle S-Curve ...An S curve market, or the products of businesses in that market, are characterized by a shallow start, where only early adopters and niche producers sell in the market. Then the market experiences a rapid growth, and the product(s) or business(es) develop (or don't) a dominant position in the emerging market. There is high volatility in the emerging market as businesses and their products are subjected to the market preferences being established, M&A, under and over capitalization takes its toll, etc.. This is where we are now, and it looks and acts a lot like trading in a bull market. After the rapid growth, the market maintains a high performance level but with little growth (or even contraction), which signals a mature but saturated market. This is where we are going in the near future. That typically looks and acts like trading a bear market.In both of the above, in my mind anyway, it's not ""investing"", it's trading.Once we're in a mature market, now we can consider ""investing"" in the businesses that have survived, mindful of actual bull and bear market cycles, but I believe it's a misnomer to apply the bull / bear cycle analogy to an S-curve market model.. there may be correlation at points along the way, but if in the future you end up describing a ""bull phase of a bear market"" or ""bear phase of a bull market"" or some similar concept (which I think you'll encounter if you stick with the bull / bear business cycle model) you'll know you're applying the wrong model to this market stage - I believe that should be reserved for investing in mature markets.A sector drop of, say 20% (bear market indicator?)  is, like, every other month in this S-curve market phase/transition which will continue for at least another year.",

"This is an industry in its infancy. If you take a fundamental approach to looking at the sector you will see that legalization in all forms of use (i.e. medicinal, recereational, food and beverage) is just a matter of time. And not just in Canada, but the world at large. The next major catalyst (IMO) will be the World Health Organization giving their blessing to (and descheduling) the use of Cannabinoids in all forms. This process is taking place now. It is a slow process.The WHO is getting recommendations from member nations (The USA most importantly) on descheduling Cannabinoids and will come forth with their recommendation. From what I have read, this will most likely be finalized at the WHO conference in March 2019. So we have a major catalyst occuring within the next 6 months. After that is finalized the industry will grow exponentially and we could have a bull makrt in these stocks for the next 5 - 6 years at a minimum....",

"@Dhierin Bechai Just caught up reading this article, but I wonder if you have thought about writing about the seeming 'dire writings on the wall' for BA as well as AB, as the world economy slows, and aircraft demand is likely to swoon faster than our eyes can blink?I dare suggest this because I feel there are so many recently built, but used A320s, BA737s, A330s, BA777s, and yes, even A380s as well as BA747s (and BA787s) around that could, in the event of an economic swoon worldwide, to pick up the slack in terms of incremental aircraft capacity wherever that may exist.I suddenly see dire times ahead for BA as well as even more difficult times for AB, I wonder what your thoughts are, given that both AB and BA are wont to service their own aircraft, and therefore, can effectively extend the useful lifespans of airlines' existing fleet for many more years, at least until the dire economic times pass, in say, 10 years time??This is of course, not including the impact of COMAC's eventual successful introduction of its C919 plane?",

"Boeing CEO has stated that the 737 MAX 8 is a safe airplane and that the pilots were given the information and tools to fly the plane safely.That statement is being challenged by the American and Southwestern pilots union. Boeing has responded appropriately to issue guidance to pilots in the form of a bulletin to enhance the knowledge that they already have.Boeing has increase the size and weight of the 737 MAX's engines to achieve greater range while achieving more fuel saving. To do this the engines were required to be raised and moved forward changing balance points. Anyone who knows about design of commercial aircraft must appreciate that computer programs must be used to balance out all modern airplanes.Pilots are trained to fly and control a plane even without instruments to maintain known flight principles. So the argument that BA intentionally omitted information to pilots is ludicrous as all modern planes have computers doing functions in the background so that pilots can use their flying instincts to safely fly the planes.The weather was good when the Lion Air took off. The pilots approved  at this level to fly a commercial jet must know VFR rules. That is, if they take manual control, they can look out their window and see the orientation of the plain verses the horizon. So a severe pitch down would be immediately noticed.Corrective action is available to all pilots, i.e. yoke trim buttons, and the STAB TRIM cutoff switch  on the center console.SO let's see what the facts are after the investigation.",
One good thing about BA is they take everything as a challenge!,
"Dhierin, I’ve been quiet for a few months here, having battled BA throughout the summer as one of the lone bears, as u may recall. Thanks as always for the great articles. You are one of the few genuine value-adds on SA, in my humble opinion. I am jumping back in the loop here to inquire if and why you are still long Boeing? Maybe I can finally shake you to my side. The stock has acted awfully the past week plus, and I’m not convinced its entirely related to the Lion Air tragedy.  For one, the stock no longer leads. For damn sure their price-insensitive company buyer is still  repurchasing aggressively, so that’s a major change, seemingly. Second, with all the mounting evidence that we are late or ultra-late cycle now, the theme of the market has been multiple compression, and BA trades at a very elevated multiple vs its long term average, and an absurd one if in fact this is the 9th inning of the cycle. I get the whole service & maint angle that should smooth over any abrupt decline in orders vs prior cycle peaks, but companies in that sector get obliterated in downcycles, too, so I’m not convinced the slowing shifting mix warrants any multiple expansion. Second, I still believe that massive order cancellations are not far out if we enter recession, and third, I hate their accounting and always have. This whole program acctg gimmick is just that - its been questioned heavily over the past many years, especially 2013-2016. Over that same span is when she became a ‘free cash flow’ story. Yet, I truly believe she has been dazzling wall street with rhinestones as all these deferred/capitalized development costs have artificially boosted that precious metric, making BA look, shall I say ‘not grossly overvalued’. However, if any other company deferred/capitalized the same way, we’d hear bloody hell. Companies like MSFT, IBM and ORCL have capitalized R&D like made over the years, but like depreciation, its added back in at a ratable rate. The ‘per unit’ method BA uses seems to be far more aggressive. Anyway, I’m like a broken record with my bearishness on BA, but I just want to know your thoughts on the recent stock performance, and if you think there is something oddd going on other than the Lion Air story? Thanks again.",
"Given the number of cancellations, I have a question.  Are they related to the growing negative animus toward Trump worldwide.  I can't help but think that his insults and bullying antagonism toward Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, all of Central & South America, China, & Japan has to translate into reduced orders or cancellations over time for Boeing.  Do you see this as a problem for BA on the horizon?",

Interesting how all these new names are turning up this week (with less than fifty comments between them) alerting us to all the AMRN problems. Anyone who has spent any time investing in biotech has seen it all before.,
Dr.Sek is a professor of Medicine at the Harvard Medical School.... I think his comment is already enough.,
Now new problem with AMRN. Inquired with my Cardiologist. She says check with your Health Insurance Co first as they are not approving the written RX’s due to high cost of Vascepa,
"In the last 5 days the most prestigious journals...New England Journal of Medicine and the American Cardiology Assn published excellent, expert based articles. Bottom line, very supportive of Vascepa. Not to offend anyone, but these expert opinions are more impactful and informed than most entries if not all comments in this thread.",

"Ive been long since Aug and have added to my position post results, having done my own DCF analysis based on conservatively low peak sales estimates. And have recommended to F&F based on that analysis. I suppose I never realized the extent to which this stock had become so momentum driven. I still believe firmly in a long-term valuation above $40, certainly with buyout potential high. However, in hindsight, I was discounting many of the risk factors that I think, now that the momo trade is unwinding, many investors are starting to price in. In reading so many of the comments across the various SA articles, it’s clear that a lot of long investors, the proverbial chorus, are giving so little consideration to the risks (label expansion, sales execution, secondary dilution, etc). But the market is obviously reflecting more mixed sentiment. I expect to see a lot of volatility in the stock before label expansion is improved. And I think many are exiting or shying away because of this risk. Should this risk be resolved, I think we’ll see investors pour into the stock once again, and only then will buyout potential begin to refuel the momentum. Until that time, I see volatility btwn 15-21 or thereabouts. Thoughts?",

I saw that one commentator put a rough 90% likelihood of expansion approval. Is there really that little risk at this point? And then in terms of a BO, won’t that have to come after label expansion (hard to think it would precede FDA decision)? So, any ideas on what the timeline for that decision is?",
"The good thing is, is I doubt doctors actually wait for the expanded approval from FDA to prescribe Vascepa to people who have lower than 500 mg/dL.  There is nothing preventing Doctors from prescribing off label. In fact, after looking at the data set I would be shocked if doctors actually waited for the green light from the FDA.  Sales of Vascepa should pick up very nicely now.. Great article by the way... It pretty much squashed the whole mineral oil issue that keeps getting brought up ad nauseam.",

"Pls see jupiter subgroup where ldl <60 and hsCRP >2. Statin treatment produced RRR of 40% for this subgroup of 1000 patients. Statin reduces hsCRP by 25-40%.In reduceIT because statin absorption started getting impacted after mineral oil consumption, likely hsCRP went up by 30%. Now tell me if the RRR seen in vascepa arm can be explained away ?",
"At this point the controversy only applies to investors. Cardiologists have overwhelmingly embraced the results as positive, and they can easily prescribe Vascepa off label, and apparently get reimbursement. As tuuka mentioned above, the following months of sales data will be a meaningful harbinger, the canary in the coal mine. That should have at least a stabilizing effect.  However, while it is more likely than not that the FDA will approve the expanded label next year, no one can deny that the FDA is unpredictable and sometimes manipulated by BP, so illogical decisions are not out of the question. The BO catalyst will loom until the FDA decision,and the unanswerable question at this point is whether a BP is willing to pay a mega-sum for the peak potential ahead of the sNDA,, and whether AMRN has a reasonable perspective on what they should be bought for. Given AMRN’s track record with the FDA, I wholeheartedly believe that a BP would ensure a positive outcome and AMRN would be better off selling now. It will be an interesting ridenow that the shorts have jumped in, especially if we see the BO rumor mill start churning, as the stock price will get whipsawed. Buckle up.",

I think SEC might investigate or Amarin's legal team might investigate the hack job the Street engineered taking this non issue to such a FUD to the level of unimaginable amount of fear inflicted in the minds of poor retail investors lose their investment causing a huge drop in the AMRN stock value from its peak down 30% in two days. The author of this article did not discuss that Amarin won First Amendment victory that it can sell Vascepa using those two off label coupons allowed by FDA while it is pursuing Reduce It approval from FDA, imo.

And not forgetting the shareholders who are frankly being abused and manipulated IMO.

"The trouble with Mylan, and the stock, is the general lack of access, transparency and engagement by management and the board. The headlines have been slow and the performance has been very lumpy culminating with an unexpected rebasing of 2018 in Q2. Instead of taking an introspective look at some of the issues that plague the company Heather simply lashes out and plays the victim of some, callous and deliberate maligning by investors who have managed to suppress the performance of her stock price. When, in fact, investors just don't trust her or her team to produce and when they do they are often missing the target.  That being said I do believe there is truth to your long thesis but management, is plagued by hubris and incompetence, which takes the teeth out some of the upside when they overshoot and miss targets. In my mind the revenue ramp for these complex generics were always a marathon and the long game needed to be played as, I believe, they act more like a second brand than a generic but management, gets ahead of themselves and over commits, takes shortcuts, and underestimates the complexities of launches. This causes the stock suffer more so which is only exacerbated by managements nose thumbing to their shareholders. It's no coincidence that the company charter and country of listing is management friendly. They done this to sidestep any accountability. At the end of the day Mylan (as a company is not a bad bet) but the stock performance and lack of investor confidence can be put squarely on the shoulders of Heather, Rajeev and Courey. It should be clear anyone who has eyes and ears that Heather has no spine and almost no conviction.

"Agreed on all points in the article. A few things though...In using the service, they don't appear to be doing any pre or mid roll ads at all. I'm wondering if, even the addition of one pre roll add wouldn't result in a significant revenue boost while not having too negative an impact on user growth? Twitch for example uses pre roll ads, but their user growth and popularity seem to be booming.Also,  I understand management has downplayed the impact of the videogame ban and to add to that their user growth has been stellar despite the ban. But, it's hard for me to imagine user growth not being significantly impacted in a positive way when new games and thus new games are introduced on their platform? Additionally, marketing money spent by Tencent & other publishers surely has declined and represents potentially lost revenue for HUYA? Once the ban is lifted and videgame marketing dollars  are being spent again, it seems only logical that HUYA would be one of the key places these dollars would land? The stock dropped >5% today, only a few days after reporting what I thought was a very positive report and guidance, even in the face of challenges. I'm wondering, what is it going to take for this thing (and IQ) to get the kind of benefit of the doubt that other US based companies get?

"I got lucky and bought this stuff in the $40s a couple of years ago.  But, for those who don't currently own it, the only reason to buy it now is because of the dividend.  There will never be any appreciation in this stock as the price of oil is going to stay low for a long, long, long, time.  Why?  Because all the majors and even the minors and the chump outfits are finding oil.  The stuff is as available as dirt.  When is the last time you saw an article entitled as follows:  Oil Companies Can't Find Oil; Dry Holes Are The Norm?  Answer:  You have never seen such an article because every company that tries to find oil finds it.  They find it in the ocean; on the land; underground and even in my backyard where I hit paydirt just digging a concrete footing for my new deck. Hell, I bagged the idea of a new deck and just bought a new house instead with my 100 bpd well which won't start to subside for 2 years.  The stuff is all over the place and the price will only go lower.  Thus, no appreciation in Shell's share price or that of any other major.  As for the CFO's comments on the last few quarters, who cares, that is history and has nothing to do with the new world order where oil is cheap and oil companies can't make a lot of money.  But, new buyers of this stuff just have to hope that they can continue to pay their dividends, which they should be able to do even with lower oil prices for years to come.  But, 6% on your money ain't a bad return, considering that the general market isn't going to give you that as it is extremely overpriced and destined for a fall, steeper than the one already experienced.  If there is a major recession, expect to see serious erosion in the share value and your dividend will be threatened also.  That might not occur, though,  But, it is a serious risk.  There is more likelihood of that happening than appreciation in the share price.",

"Essentially, a price target is an individual analyst's expectation of the future price of a security, usually a stock. OK - with that in mind - how are price targets determined? Using technical analysis, traders rely on tools such as previous support and resistance, Fibonacci extensions and moving averages to determine an appropriate price target. Now here is the kicker - price targets are a function of risk tolerance and the amount of time an investor plans on holding the security. Read that last half of that line again - ""the amount of time an investor plans on holding the security"". What is important about this specific detail? Let's look at HD as an example - Ratings Breakdown:Consensus Price Target:	 By 26 Wall Street AnalystToday $204.4326	30 Days Ago $206.5396	90 Days Ago $204.0380	180 Ago Days $196.6768Subsequent Price Target Upside:	Today 16.52% upside	30 Days Ago 8.85% upside	90 Days 4.30% upside	180 Days 4.63% upsideWith that in mind - pick a price - any price - get in at whatever entry point that you feel comfortable with - wait for x or y or z as a price point - focus on analyst target prices - meanwhile - I am going to continue to dollar cost into shares of a Great American Company.

In the gas turbine-powered electrical generation marketplace, its product line spans the power range of 2–750 MW in simple-cycle mode. GE is enhancing its product range to exploit developing technology. The LM6000 has been continually improved in efficiency and emissions levels, especially with use of the steam injection process. GE’s Frame series are also being improved, through technology injection from the CF6 and GE90 airline turbofan programs.Yet for all its market strength, GE has been hit hard by the economic forces. It has been forced into major restructuring, reductions in staffing levels, and the divestiture of subsidiaries. But the company’s established business, licensee, and packaging agreements with more than 30 firms worldwide, have broadened the geographic appeal of GE units. And the harsh market conditions facing its traditional large-frame gas turbines are being offset by the manufacture of GE LM500, LM2500, LM6000 and LM9000 gas turbines. Almost half of the world’s projected increase in energy production will be supplied by GE gas turbines.Siemens2018-2027 Production                          % of Total1,034 units                                               24.02018-2027 Production Value              % of Total$29.21 billion                                         427.192018-2027 Power Capacity (GW)      % of Total122.2                                                         26.13Despite the company’s acquisition of the Rolls Royce industrial turbine range, Siemen’s sales and market share have both declined. Siemens has been restructuring its operations aggressively. It shrunk from 18 divisions in 2013 to five. It raised more than 9 billion euros in merging, selling, or spinning off businesses. It is now investing a substantial proportion of this money in new technologies. Aeroderivatives acquired from Rolls-Royce offer Siemens an opportunity to compete more broadly in power generation.

It also announced restructuring. It is predicted to account for 10% of unit production, 15% of production value, and 15% of capacity for the forecast period.Despite the vicissitudes of the last year, the top three companies in the electrical generation gas turbines hold 90.63% by value of the market. In both critical market projection parameters, total unit numbers, and total capacity, it is clear that the market is highly concentrated and becoming more so. Other participants in the sector are limited to niche applications.Subdivision of the market shows the dominance of the 250 to 500 MW turbine capacity segment. The 500 to 750 MW segment is growing slowly but has a long way to go before it challenges the 250 to 500 MW segment in capacity terms. It is hard to avoid the impression that the 250 to 500 MW sector represents a sweet spot in electricity generation terms, one where considerations of capital cost, efficiency, environmental protection, and return on investment coincide.Authors:Stuart Slade is the Senior I&M Gas Turbines Analyst at Forecast International.

A while back Siemens acquired the Westinghouse turbine-generator business with US HQ in Orlando.  They continue to be a strong competitor to GE even in a bad market.,
Great article! Food for thought.,
"Nice article. Finally someone picks up the topic of GE versus Siemens again, one of the most epic industrial rivalries of history.jimztuff: ABB has acquired some of GE's business and looks in good shape now, similar to Siemens. Siemens is very strong in the U.S., especially in Software (plus a bloody nose with Dresser Rand)",
I could see Siemens setting up a US division (if they haven't) and acquiring some of GE's business.,

I sold it and haven't looked back.  Re: Siemens, it looked like a screaming buy to me about 12 months ago, and since then it's down 15%.  Certainly not the worst performer in my portfolio, but not my best, either.  Given the 'great economy' we are enjoying, it's a little distressing to see so much carnage in the markets lately.

"@ MauiJim95:The converse is probably, at least in my experience, more often found.The new owner of a spun-off organization doesn't know the business, gets rid of too many former managers.  The true leaders then follow their former managers out the door.The company by this time is unrecognisable: new name, new logo, new (shrunken) product range, and less understanding of its customers and dispirited workforce.  Plus, often, reduction in both stock and cash, as the new owners try for a sugar pill of getting ""their"" money back from a business that they haven't figured out yet how to love and to feed.  One company demanded 100% return of capital plus 18% YoY dividends from each of dozens of subsidiaries and divisions by the end of the second year - which was not a recipe for success.This corporate amnesia results from mismanagement on a sweeping scale.  The shell of the former business no longer remembers how to operate. It goes under in a year or two.My experience has included two notable examples of this and none of where the unshackled unit derives energy from its culture and accelerates.  By comparison, Siemens's approach to growing their business appears to be less risky than GE's recent attempts to cure the patient through sequential amputations with, seemingly, little vision of a growing, highly productive future.  We observe what GE is losing (including share price) and cannot see where the future gains will come from.  Has GE anything at all to trumpet, to celebrate to justify even its current share price?  When will the shrinking stop?",
"One of the reasons why business units that are spun off do well is that everyone that stays is really glad to be rid of the “Corporate” people that don’t understand the business and we’re constantly interfering. The team immediately becomes laser-focused  on success of the new enterprise. Management structure is lean and much flatter. And above all, almost everyone that works there WANTS to be there. This “culture”, in fact, attracts talented energetic people from competitors.",
"MJ95.    GE Aviation, since the dreadful days of ‘CEO of the Century’ Daft Jack, has been suppressing almost all kinds of innovation, in favor of ‘standardisation’ of most engineering approaches.

Unfortunately, the people carrying most of the resulting burden are the underpaid employees and the totally downtrodden retirees. A curse upon Welch, Immelt, Comstock, Rice and all their inept, crooked hench-persons!",
"Good article. I’d add in the “wounded” section; They have certainly lost key innovators that have become dismayed with the ineptitude of management. Every great company has them. They are not necessarily high level people but they usually know the product better than management does so they constantly improve it - in spite of management. They are motivated by being allowed to tinker at the edges. 3M had it at one time. When the company they are so proud of is severely damaged by inept people that make 5x their pay, they start looking and leave. Lack of true leadership. Leadership! To be a true leader, you have to have followers. Followers that do the actual work and are proud of what they do. If you’re a good leader your employees look forward to challenges and volunteer to tackle them knowing that you will recognize them and encourage them....and never blame them.",

Sue British Columbia for damage, a wild guess is $50 Billion, for cutting off Alberta oil exports on purpose.2. Put a tariff/tax/fee on Alberta oil and gas that goes to BC that is the same as how much it would cost to import overseas oil, minus $1. So now Alberta oil is $11, maybe $55 to import so charge BC $54 a barrel of Alberta oil, same scheme on nat gas.3. Give a tax holiday to Alberta citizens of 50% on federal taxes to make up for national sabotage of Alberta oil exports.4. For all Albertans that are known to be in favor of the oil pipeline sabotage, especially politicians, give them what they want. Which is a gas tax equal to what oil would cost if all countries had their oil bottlenecked the same way as Alberta now. Let's say what the oil price would be if 25% of worldwide oil was cut off due to pipeline bottlenecks. That should be maybe $250 a barrel price. Translate that into a tax only supporters of pipeline bottlenecking would pay. Have a college study done on it. Maybe works out to $10 extra tax per gallon of gas for every known supporter the bottleneck. They have a big decal on their cars by law that says ""Oil Pipeline Bottlenecker"" and gas stations charge them an extra $10 a gallon.5. Publically starts talks with United States for Alberta to leave Canada and become the 51st State of USA so pipeline bottlenecking can be ended. The rest of Canada wants Alberta not to be able to export oil, so leave Canada. Put same $54 price on all Alberta oil for other provinces that support pipeline bottlenecking.6. Put 1-5 into practice in 24 hours.That might solve the problems. Maybe the support of pipeline bottlenecking will decrease, but if not Alberta has options. BTW the only way someone can get the $10 gallon tax taken off is to give 1 hour videotaped speech about why they are in favor of pipelines being built.Cheers",

"From what I read, Escobal is no where near ""turn key"" as most people described. Management issues maybe, but more importantly, the mine is 40KM away from Guatemala capital, and after a short period of operation, local people found increased arsenic level in their water systems. I wasn't sure about the credibility of the articles, then I watched the video on PAAS website announcing the TAHO deal - the CEO of PAAS made a special point in the short video that Escobal had state of the art water treatment system - there's no point for him bringing that up unless he knows it's something to be concerned about, and I found it more suspicious than assuring for him to plugging that statement in somewhere seemingly completely illogical. TAHO has problems with some of their other operations as well, the stock price tanked for many reasons... So for what TAHO has to offer, my opinion is 1.07 billion is already over paid.",
"The fact that TAHO management fully supports this deal at this price merely proves that they are part of the Idiot Brigade of mining management teams (if further proof was required - many would argue not). Having good assets means nothing if management is part of this elite brigade (see EGO and AUY) - on that basis, much better to be with PAAS management than TAHO management at basically any price.",
"This deal reminds me of one of those movies in which a bank robbery is an inside job. In this case, PAAS would be pulling off a heist with inside help from TAHO.It's important to keep in mind sentiment drives price across all time frames. I have maintained a sentiment analysis of TAHO for quite a while, and by my wave count, TAHO shareholders would be better served by an independent TAHO, as TAHO is near a major change in trend. (TAHO is completing at large degree a common corrective pattern known as a zigzag.) To be sure, I believe many precious metal securities are in a similar position, including PAAS, but it appears to me TAHO shareholders have potential for much more capital appreciation through TAHO than PAAS.In the end, I think TAHO shareholders will be fine with either outcome, but this deal does smell like fish to me.

FT - as I understand it one could get $3.40 in cash + the warrants (if Escobal restarted) or Alternatively shares in PAAS + warrants?  Is that correct?  If so couldn’t one arbitrage the current price to $3.40 ($.12-.$.15 by January) and the essentially get the warrants essentially for free.  The risk is the deal falls thru and TAHO reverts to sub $3.00.  That said I also believe value of TAHO should be $8+ with functional Escobal Mine.

"The danger was Guatemala stretching the Escobal closure to infinity and beyond. Can't happen? Well, don't let your EGO get in the way.I complained to IR they (Guatemala) were screwing with us. The last news bite was there was no deadline to complete the consultation. This could go on and on and on. Meanwhile, the Guatemalan economy sinks further and further. The commies in the country are using projects, especially electrical, to generate revenue. They probably have been supporting the mine closure in the hopes of taking a bite out of it long term with the support of antimining NGO's.Meanwhile, the average Guatemalan gets held hostage with the only light at the end of the tunnel in the USA.

"Buyout by PAAS is good for TAHO shareholders because they get competent company management instead of incompetence.  Over the past 12 months (and as of this moment) TAHO is down 27% and PAAS is down 16%. My unfortunate decision to keep holding TAHO was based on the logical expectation that the Escobal mine would open any day now. I should have realized that politics and logic have never coexisted and they are mutually exclusive in Latin America. Just yesterday I was thinking of buying PAAS but I saw it was sinking and at a yearly low.  This is despite new findings of apparently vastly larger silver resources at its La Colorada mine in Mexico. Today it sinks far further, father. So, I am enthusiastic about trading in bad TAHO for good PAAS, despite the low conversion ratio. Based on prices today it should be 0.26 PAAS share per TAHO share but only 0.24 was offered, but it's a small matter, and the sooner the better (I will feel).",Tahoe Resources And Pan American Silver Tie The Knot In A $1.07 Billion Deal
I saw a Vascepa commercial already last night!! Moved fast on that.,
"hi there,Does anybody know the source of this:-†In MARINE trial, on average, along with diet changes, adults with very high triglycerides experienced a 33% reduction without raising LDL-C vs. placebo. Individual results may vary.I could not find the actual calculation figures for the 33% reduction on I assume 4g in how many weeks? Thanks!",
"How would you guys (actually experts) calculate the sales of Vascepa for the first 5 years? The monthly fee seems approximately $80. How much would Amarin get totally from the payers for each patient every month? How many people would meet the labeling range?  From https://vascepasavings.com/, it shows""Pharmacist Instructions for a Cash-Paying Patient: Submit this claim to Change Healthcare. A valid Other Coverage Code (e.g. 1) is required. The patient is responsible for the first $9 and the card pays up to the next $80 on a monthly fill or $240 on a 90 day fill. Reimbursement will be received from Change Healthcare.""",
"Motorhead - Good article, but I'd correct you on one point.  You mention that, at worst, the RI RRR drops to 19%, like JELIS, the prior trial did not use mineral oil.  In fact, JELIS got 19% RRR using only a 1.8 gram dose, less than half of RI's 4 gram dose.  So, if looking to JELIS for an indication of what RI performance might have been if not for mineral oil, it is appropriate to multiply 19 by 4/1.8 which is in the ballpark of about 40%.  Note that JELIS was much more heavily weighted with angina events, and RI reported 32% for angina.  As Harvard Med School prof Bhatt pointed out in his interview (video available on youtube), in fact the biggest the mineral oil effect could possibly be is about 4%, and it can't really be that big because the subjects with elevated LDL-C, who are at the heart of this issue, actually had fewer events, not more as feared, so the mineral oil issue is inconsequential, as FDA had ruled years ago.  The two key opinion leader cardiologists the Jeffries analyst interviewed about this also saw it that way, and called the RI results a home run.",
"Motörhead, great article!",
"1) Some of these cardiologists are PIs for competitive trials. Some did not have any issues with the trial. Some probably felt the need to say something to scrutinize being interviewed by Forbes. And honestly, none of them do not seem to not believe in the effect. And regarding Ethan Weiss who did not attend AHA himself, I am not fully aware why he is become a main guru for Forbes. I do not know his work in he field but know him more as a Twitter cardiologists/guru than a international renown key opinion leader in the field or a mega trialist. Everyone are entitled to an opinion. 2) AMRN designed the trial with the input and agreement from FDA. FDA were well aware of the mineral oil “issue” when approving the REDUCE-IT trial design. Main point is that the drug is safe and the efficacy is very good. FDA and EMA are professionals and have no problem putting the R-IT trial results into context if the other results from “competitor” investigational compounds.",

Anyway let me publish the questions I had for Dr Bhatt in an article tomorrow. I think I can answer some of those using public content he/AMRN has already produced. I agree with Motorhead, this is a non issue and a buying opportunity.",

"I would have to agree with Puche that the buyout is not happening any time soon. At least not before FDA makes their move which is probably sometime next year. But the good news is that Amarin is in a unique position due to the first amendment settlement with FDA that they can actually promote Reduce It as off-label to prescribers now which they already started doing.So to me, this is an opportunity for Amarin to prove themselves in the next 6 - 9 months that this product can grow exponentially given the blowout trial results and big pharma would have to pay a hefty price similar to what Pfizer did to Pharmacia if they come to the table a year from now on.",
Why do you think a buyout is not in the cards anytime soon ? I’m clueless about it and would like to know why some people feel so strongly about an imminent buyout while others are skeptical about this possibility.,
"Motorhead, I enjoyed the article.  Though I don't necessarily agree with everything in the article I did enjoy the read and your view.  As I've stated in some previous posts, I expect the weak money to finish being washed out shortly.  At that point, the stock can start to trade more on what investors believe the revenue and profitability potential is based on various probability analysis.  I can see these estimates being very wide and hence the volatility should remain in the stock until the FDA formally presents its decision over the next 6 - 9 months or so.IMO I don't believe a buyout is in the cards anytime soon.  Of course that's just my two cents.Slow and steady!  Good luck to all!",

"Motorhead, thank you for your article.   I have a question.  Can you tell me when you submitted the article to Seeking Alpha?  I am just curious how long they delayed publication.   Thank you.",
"Motorhead, thank you for doing the legwork of actually going to the AHA Meeting.  First hand information is far more informative than that from remote 3rd parties.  I was following AMRN at the time of the 2013 CV Adcom meeting.  The panel was composed entirely of cardiologists, and at the time, cardiologists were married to Lipitor.  Virtually all panel members had 10-12 support grants from BPs.  There were no lipidologists on the committee.Apart from rudeness toward the AMRN presenters at the Adcom, at the very end, the moderator brought up the possibility, entirely out of the blue, of mineral oil raising the LDL-C to the point of affecting the results of the Marine trial.  I did a med search then, using keywords of ""mineral oil"" and "" LDL-C"" and various others, there were no reports whatsoever, in the entire worldwide literature, of an association between these, going back to the time of the availability of electronic reports.  Thus, IMO, the concept was an entirely fictitious creation on the part of the moderator. Because of this, the FDA required a three year study, which, in general would be cost prohibitive for a small cap, likely killing most companies.  I consider it ""The Little Company That Could,"" and it survived.  That same week, a NEJM article by one of the Adcom members, regarding approval of PCSK-9 inhibitors, specifically stating that they would not require the follow-up study.  This in spite of the fact that they had known adverse side effects, some serious.Based on the description of some possible side effects of mineral oil placebo, specifically, (put delicately) leakage, one might have expected a higher dropout rate of the placebo patients, but don't know if this was reported.Clearly, BP did not want this drug on the market, and it was from a small cap biopharma with no BP big brother to protect it.  The FDA dances to BP's tune.",
"The FDA will not order another study. There is no debating that Vescepa works. The debate is by how much due to mineral oil possibly not being inert. Ordering another trial means possibly withholding a drug that saves lives for a few more years. Think about that. Yes, doctors can prescribe off label but alot of docs won't do that and most insurance won't cover unless its for indicated condition.",
"Has any of the funds who own AMRN investigated the fact that this Forbe,s report on AMRN was written by a journalist who has no medical or clinical experience or background Investors should read a recent SA report detailing the overwhelming response from Cardiologists re this Drug and nonsensical hoopla of mineral oil used in placebo",
When exactly did Forbes become a trusted scientific journal?  One of the big Pharmas should buy or partner with both AMRN and ESPR.,
Buy now.  Buy long term calls,
"There were cardiologists cited in the Forbes article as well that had doubts about the MO placebo tarnishing the results of Vascepa. However, even they had not suggested that Vascepa doesn't work.Other fear that FDA will order a new study IMO has knocked down the stock price. I think once this fear is overcome, investor sentiment on AMRN will turn positive.",

There's nothing in it for me to believe you truly attended the AHA or the post-AHA meeting. I'm long AMRN but the article from DoctorRx actually bothers me. I try to not usually mind those kinds of articles but after reading his his I went to supplementary material and looked more closely at ApoB and hsCRP biomarker data. These two have been studied extensively on their effects on inflammation and hsCRP >=2 have been established to cause significant inflammation and therefore greater CV risk. It is particularly bothering to see if increase by 30% in placebo group. The doctors at AHA especially those who were a part of the study would obviously refute it while those who are involved in competitive trails like Mr.Nissen from Cleveland Clinic would dismiss effects of V. But I'd love to hear from anyone in this board who can shed some scientific light on hsCRP and apoB. I think there is some placebo effect. Whether it is significant to cause FDA to ask for supporting study, I don't know. Testing times ahead is all i can say.",

"When Boeing reclassified two early airplanes as R&D expenses, does any of that expense get capitalized, or just the tooling? I'm not familiar with how aircraft R&D is done, I'm more familiar with software, which can be capitalized after it's viable. But, it also allowed capturing the R&D tax credit on the construction of those aircraft.The new tax law also makes more of the profit flow through to the bottom line, so existing profits are more valuable to shareholders than originally anticipated. I'm not sure if tax calculations factor into the deferred production costs.",
an excellent article about the continuation of the 787 performance. I agree with another‘s poster comment that the 787 technology impact is far reaching. But great to see how much the financials for this plane came along.,
"DB, this is probably the article I look forward to most each quarter. I honestly believe the 787 program is BA's cash cow well into the future and they are milking it for all it's worth.Thanks again for the in depth commentary.",
"Just curious, is the in-depth model written/coded in Excel?",
Good article.The 787 was conceived at a time when the airlines were in serious trouble.  The 787 probably jumped 2 generations.  Boeing re-wrote the book on what was possible in aviation. The 787 introduced so many firsts into commercial A/P travel that many still underestimate its impact on BA and the aviation world itself...ALL carbon body/wings....bleed air...many more electric components...even the lavatories were a huge step up...BA left no stone unturned on this A/P.  Imo the 787 will have and has had more impact than the 747 did....its that groundbreaking.  It not only taught BA much A/P wise it taught MANY supply lessons as well...and they way planes will be assembled well into the future. Despite the fact it will take many frames to zero out financially...it will cause other models to ZERO much earlier due to the knowledge gained from the 787.  The other thing that BA did was allow airlines to acquire these incredibly fuel efficient airplanes for less than cost...in effect BA was subsidising the airlines...who today are in much better shape and able to buy more Ba aircraft. The amount of business the 787 has and will generate in the future are well worth the cost.The day will come when the amount of money it made or lost will be mute compared to its impact on Ba and the aviation world...a plane truly abead of its time...waaay ahead.,
"DB. Well done, especially explaining the goodness that comes with block extensions..... I'm starting to suspect that there is no necessity to zero the production balance at any point in time sooner than the end of the last accounting block.  IMHO, as long as the airplane sells and the blocks are reasonably extendable, it is better to keep upping the margins and booking the profits now.  In an FCF game, this provides opportunity funds to do greater things.  This thinking also has merit when you look at the flattening of the learning curve and its long term affects on cost recovery.  Reducing future line numbers DPB contributions in the face of a flattening learning curve allows you to grow margins into the future........",

Manufacturing, sales and marketing is the new priority otherwise they will not be around. This leadership does not possess the skill set to navigate Aratana in these areas.

IMO, if it weren’t for Engaged Capital’s involvement, mgmt’s priorities would still be what’s the pipeline over manufacturing and ramping sales. The time to sell is when product ramp up is accelerating. I candidly had hoped for a mid to upper teens stock price but over $9.50 would now be acceptable.

The problem for me is when this valuable dissenting opinion is coming at the bottom of the Co's valuation when I'm stuck with my investments. I would much prefer to listen to you a few months ago when this author valued ACRX at over $27/share (which also seemed delusional and which he corrected 10 days later down to $6). But I don't remember any doctor ever commenting on ACRX until now despite quite a few positive SA articles giving it upbeat valuations. Your operational experience should definitely be a real concern to investors. However, I find it difficult to imagine the management, including the CMO who is a co-founder and an anaesthesiologist herself, would risk tens of thousands $$ buying the stock this past November. They would be completely dumb to do so if the chances of hospitals taking up the drug would be minimal.

"2 Biotech Penny Stocks to Buy Right Now:finance.yahoo.com/...A victim of bad pressNormally, the Food and Drug Administration green-lighting your top drug candidate results in a nice uptick in your share price and market capitalization. AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, however, has seen its shares drop by an astonishing 54% since the FDA approved its sublingual opioid, Dsuvia, on Nov. 2. The problem? Investors are apparently concerned about Dsuvia's tsunami of bad press since its approval. The big knock against the drug is basically the timing of its approval. Right now, the raging opioid crisis is reportedly claiming 115 American lives every single day. Critics have thus argued that approving yet another powerful opioid in the midst of this crisis is an absolutely terrible move by the FDA. To counter this sea of negativity, AcelRx has noted in its various investor presentations that Dsuvia both fills an unmet medical need (patients who are not amenable to injected opioids) and it can only be administered in medically supervised settings, whereby minimizing the potential for diversion and abuse. The drug also stands to fill a clear need in battlefield situations where wounded soldiers need rapid pain relief but are unable to receive an IV-administered pain reliever. What's the upside? Despite the stock's painful drop over the last two months, AcelRx should turn out to be a stellar long-term play for patient investors. After all, Wall Street and the company both have Dsuvia generating close to $500 million in annual sales within the next few years. That projected sales estimate is considerably larger than AcelRx's current market capitalization, suggesting that this stock is ridiculously undervalued right now.",

You are doing okay.  Really appreciate your effort here.  @<span title='greatdayforinvestments'>greatdayforinvestmen...</span>This company has been burning $175 million for the past 5 years.  Accumulated deficit is $25 million as of the date of the last 10K report.$72 million in cash on the balance sheet probably came from the $92 million proceeds from sale of future royalties.  The cash will last another year at most.It will take the sales staff at least 18 months (3 phases) to hustle hospitals and clinics for revenue to really materialize.  It is not ""Wham bam thank you Madam.  Let's sign the contract now."" when it comes to pushing a new medication to hospitals and clinics.  The hospitals and clinics prefer ""tried and true"" method to avoid lawsuits.  Meantime, there are overheads to be paid.Also there is a good chance that the CEO is brought in to sell the biggest growth asset to a bigger pharma, easy way out for mgmt and BOD.  They will get paid handsomely.  But just not the retail investors.Low institutional ownership; high short interest and the list goes on.I don't bash; I like to ask questions.I like to cover all my angles based on my experience.  A higher discount rate is a quick and dirty way to compensate for all those risks.",
Your DCF skills leave a lot to be desired and do not generate much confidence in your stock valuations. No wonder your target prices are all over the place from week to week.,
Thank you for looking as DCF again Doug.,
"Hi Doug,Appreciate the effort.  A few concerns that I have listed below.  Maybe you can give me the answers.  I am not into numbers much if there is no qualitative back up (common sense) or a sanity check to complete the valuation.1.  Sales may not meaningfully materialize until 3QTR of 2020.  Assuming the cash burn rate at $15 mil per qtr, where would the cash come from to pay those sales reps to hustle the hospitals and clinics.  Another round of 12 millions shares offering?  If this happened, this would further dilute the shares and the value no?2.  What about Zalviso's commercial viability?  Did mgmt provide any hint/guidance for Zalviso?  I like the drugs but I don't like one trick pony stock.3.  The company has 2 CFOs within a short period of 3 years.  Why is that?  Did mgmt elaborate on changing their horses mid-course?  Did you do some homework on finding out why the former CFO left  or resigned?4.  There is a good chance that G&A will grow just as much as sales growth.  Your extrapolation of G & A growth is way too linear and optimistic.  Can you revise your DCF model to show the G & A growth rate to be in line with revenue growth rate?  And addition of a terminal value helps.5.  My guess is mgmt has some faith in their drugs but not that much.  If they did, they would not bring in a CEO who had experience in slashing costs into a profitable position and then sell the entity for a bigger pharma.  Stock price will get hit once a bigger pharma started ne2gotiation the buy-sell agreement.  They only want the patent to this drug and not the shares.6.  IMO, the discount rate for a company this size should be higher, say 18% to 20%.  Cantor Fitzgerald was very optimistic.  12.5% discount rate is okay but it fits with a company of a least 3 profitable years out of the past 5.7.  9.7 million in CIP on the balance sheet.  Is that capitalized salary to be written off once revenue picks up or is that property and equipment being put in place to make drugs.8.  92 millions of unearned income.  How long is the term of that contract?Good job overall.Thank you Doug.",
"Douglas your valuation work is misleading and negligent.  To not fix it reflects poorly on you and SA. You do not inform reader that u did not include a “terminal value” in your DCF to “make up for the risk of not achieving that mark”.  Never seen such an approach.  This is sophomoric. Acrx is worth $18-$20 today if hits $500mm sales 7 years out at 12.5% r done with a standard DCF.  To say it’s worth $5-$8 under that scenario is irrational and misleading.  Intelligent people can disagree on future sales and valuation, but your methodology is in error and should be corrected.  A standard DCF is done a certain way, conform or notify your readers in your document you used your own proprietary calculation that ignores 70% of the value in order to risk adjust.The market clearly does not believe Acrx will post revenue of over $50mm several years out.  So be it.",
"In the worst case there will be y take-over at 4-5 $ and most Investors will not benefit at this price.

Correct it please.,
"Appreciate the work.  But your DCFs do not include a discounted terminal value.  The future value of firm with $500mm sales will be worth at least $2.5b, then discounted back at 12.5%.  This adds another $10 -$15 to your existing DCF calculations.",
"and all going alone of course. Perhaps nobody wants to buy them, at least much above their current price? ACRX case seems at least compelling as they offer same product at a third of a price, if that calcukation of IV costs is correct of course.",
"yes but how many year will it take them to hit these peak sales? and how many shares will this $2bn cap have to be divided by? we'll be lucky if they get above post-approval USD5 in the next year.

I have sev similar ""highly promising"" ""very undervalued"" ""well capitalised"" stocks, all have crashed by 40-50% since approval a few months ago, all trading around cash and downtrending.",
"As far as I know, they are going down the paths like MNKD.....I hope the management has the gut or skills to pull it off going alone.",
If ACRX hit peak sales of $675m then revenue x 3 would give market cap of over 2 billion and share price of $27,
"Totally agree with arisbena. ""Potential valuation"", ""ballpark figure"", ""current fair value"" are all worthless right now. There is no current fair value (apart from cash probably and then with a big discount) for a loss making Co. Until they turn out a profit all valuations are potential.",
"Hi,Liked the analysis but In my opinion its the wrong path! Time and time again companies with great products went busted going it alone. Look at $SGYP most recently... They also decided to go about it alone... Look at the shares price now.. In todays world, unless you have a really revolutionary drug, which $ACRX for all the good, does not have, you will not make it! Hope I am wrong, but looking at the price, I am really weary!

Any thoughts on upcoming catalysts?  Maybe Regeneron is bored and will up and buy them...  (I wish.),
"The negative “overreaction” was not due to the Regeneron announcement. It was due to the announced private placement. The capital raise sold unregistered shares to a small group of institutions several already ZIOP holders. They also received warrants. This was another dilutive secondary. A month ago management emphatically stated they would not do a dilutive secondary and then they did exactly that. The sell off was a result of the dilution and because management has again demonstrated they can not be trusted. IL-12 rGBM is pure folly. The CEO promised all thru 2017 it would move to ph3. Then it was paused altogether. The ceo acknowledged that the survival data was competitive to other existing therapies. Followed by an FDA HOLD that will delay much hyped point of care for another year. Dr Cooper repeats the assertion that a partnership is just around the corner. He’s been saying that for 3 years. There has been no partnership. Even Regeneron won’t put up a penny. This collaboration is on ZIOPs  dime. This biotech has a well documented history of over promising under delivering, missing timelines, burning cash, halting trials and diluting shareholders.",

Pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, the deal is expected to close prior to the end of BlackBerry’s current fiscal year (February 2019).“Cylance’s leadership in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity will immediately complement our entire portfolio, UEM and QNX in particular. We are very excited to onboard their team and leverage our newly combined expertise,” said John Chen, Executive Chairman and CEO of BlackBerry. “We believe adding Cylance’s capabilities to our trusted advantages in privacy, secure mobility, and embedded systems will make BlackBerry Sparkindispensable to realizing the Enterprise of Things.”According to Gartner in its most recent Internet of Things Backbone Survey: security was cited as the top barrier to IoT success (35%), with privacy concerns (25%), and potential risks and liabilities (25%) also in the top five.Cylance is a pioneer in applying artificial intelligence, algorithmic science, and machine learning to cybersecurity software that has proven highly effective at predicting and preventing known and unknown threats to fixed endpoints. The fast-growing company has become a market leader with an advanced and lightweight agent that resides on the endpoint, operates both online and off, and requires a minimum of memory and power to function. Founded in 2012, Cylance generates highly recurring revenue from over 3,500 active enterprise customers, including more than 20% of the Fortune 500.“Our highly skilled cybersecurity workforce and market leadership in next-generation endpoint solutions will be a perfect fit within BlackBerry where our customers, teams and technologies will gain immediate benefits from BlackBerry’s global reach,” said Stuart McClure, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Cylance. “We are eager to leverage BlackBerry’s mobility and security strengths to adapt our advanced AI technology to deliver a single platform.”www.blackberry.com/...",

Nvidia and a bunch of others picked BlackBerry QNX for safety and security and for being a RTOS. Nvidia GPU'S run on QNX in cars and they can be considered an instance or a server on wheels. How many millions of cars will Nvidia produce with its Global partners, then think about what could happen if these servers running Machine Learning and AI on wheels are then moved to servers without wheels I'm data centers that power cloud computing etc.... built on QNX?I don't have an issue with IBM paying $34B for RedHat (Enterprise version of open source Linux), then imagine how much more BlackBerry's own proprietary QNX RTOS is worth?",

RDC CEO sold the company down the river. He clearly put his own ambitions in front of the shareholders interests. It happens time & time again in Corp America.,
"RDCThe assets are as follows:(1) Four deepwater offshore drilling vessels, all of seventh generation (the last), with an estimated reproductive cost of $ 2 billion. For the sake of caution, let's take only half of this amount, or $ 1 billion.(2) Seven shallow-water rigs (""jack-ups"") for extreme weather conditions (""ultra-harsh""), estimated to cost $ 2.8 billion. Only half of this amount is worth $ 1.4 billion.(3) Three jack-ups designed for harsh environments (""harsh"") whose reproduction cost is estimated at $ 540 million, or $ 270 million divided by two.(4) Six conventional jack-ups with an estimated reproduction cost of $ 960 million, or $ 480 million divided by two.(5) We count for zero the three old-generation jack-ups, and those inactive or left in cold-stacked storage.(6) $ 90 million of cash will be received in dividends from ARO Drilling, Rowan's joint venture with Saudi Aramco - the Saudi national company.(7) $ 270 million lent and $ 31 million invested in equity in this same joint venture.(8) $1,14 milliard de fonds de roulement, dont $1,13 milliard de cash en excès.La somme de tous ces actifs donne $4,68 milliards.

Conclusion:In terms of operations, the company keeps its accounts in balance and does not lose cash. In terms of its financial position, it continues to defend an extraordinary balance sheet compared to its peers, with a debt completely covered by cash until 2024 - and by extension a risk of bankruptcy absolutely zero....",

"industry is treading water right now.  I think the deals are more interesting than simply ""expressing optimism"".  The acquirers in both cases are stacking ships to pull capacity off market.  RIG had a clean balance sheet coming out of bankruptcy so they could balance that with some debt.  ESV had the strongest balance sheet going into the downturn of this cycle so they were able to pick up world class assets on the cheap at bottom of cycle.  Deal volumes are picking up but rates are still quite bad as is utilization.  ESV is picking up the largest share of these because it has the most modern fleet and a great reputation as one of the few management teams that did not go out of business this cycle.  So long as new ship builds don't grow the industry will turn.",
"Vladimir Zernov, Thank you for yet another informative analysis. I would like to add that RIG is in the same position on the price chart as in Dec 15 and Feb 17, that is, the second month of a 4- to 6-month decline.   The first ended at $7.67  in Feb 16 and the second at $7.20 in Aug 17.   These two lows form a trendline that appears to be the support .  RIG is NOT an investment buy until Feb-Mar 19, and I think that it will test the trendline at $7 or slightly below.   The lower Bollinger bound (two standard deviations below the 20-month moving average), which is currently at $7.03 and declining will be tested in the same range.   If both hold, it is a buy for a bounce to $10-$10.50. Your point about the 2017 lows at 9 is well taken, but we are dealing here with a longer trend, and the monthly chart is more appropriate.",
I wonder if RDC will avoid Legal problems by entertaining a different (higher) offer ? My guess would be private equity somehow. Thoughts anyone please ? Good work as always Vlad.,

"Personally lost quite a bit on SDRL, but I have made quite a bit more on well timed ESV trades over the past year. It does look like there will be a bumpy ride going forward. Looking to re-enter OSD space in the near future.",
"So true Vlad that OSD is still in a world of hurt. At least you are still penning articles about OSD stocks and still reluctant to go long on any of the OSD stocks. Boy the flood of articles on SDRL has dryed up much like SDRL itself. Many of those boisterous longs surely lost lots of cash betting on that junk stock and they are all in hiding. SDRL the company is floundering along with it's weak restructured stock.  I believe it's out of BK price was $25 and now in the $16 range. Poor SDRL, just never gets any love. As for oil prices, and  it's a industry is that it's so political and so much collusion, a investor in oil names would be far better to avoid like the plague. XOM is a prime example of a big oil name going nowhere. I only own VLO in the energy space and even it is taking a beating even though it makes huge profits by turning black goo into petroleum products. Nothing is safe in oil land. Oil going to the $30's??Could be IMO.",
"Vlad, what's your potential buy target on DO? the gap down around $17.50 looks intriguing as an upside sell target assuming it fills.",
I'm taking a break and running high beta conventional players on E&P in this down turn as it has more temporary upside with the uncertainty in service.  Got lucky with my holdings in SDLP which didn't capitulate.  Saudi's will band 80-90 and that extends the timeline out some without an outage.  Majors still on the sidelines.  I'll come back at it in a quarter or two.,

The commenter stated there is no basis for excluding these drugs, and pointed out that Triferic is the only drug CMS would need to consider during that time period because CMS approved the TDAPA for the other drug (calcimimetics). The commenter stated that excluding this one drug from TDAPA would be unfair and prevent patients from gaining access to a new innovative therapy that is available and can improve their lives.Response: We generally are precluded from retroactively implementing regulations and therefore, we are unable to provide TDAPA payments for new drugs approved by the FDA since 2011. We apply the policy that was in effect when the drug is launched which, in the case of Triferic, was to provide no add-on payment for drugs in the existing ESRD PPS functional categories beyond the ESRD PPS bundled payment amount.""I'm reading that as they turned down RMTI efforts with the already approved Triferic.

Even if Triferic could eliminate the need for IV iron, we believe it would still fail to improve dialysis center economics, and dialysis centers have already demonstrated that their choice of drugs subject to bundled reimbursement is in part driven by economics,” Aschoff wrote in a research report two months ago. “We also see no safety advantages in Triferic,” he added in an update this morning, and reiterated his “sell” rating with a $4 target price on the stock.""I'm not sure when that was written, but think it was about 2 years ago when RMTI was around $7 a share -- seems pretty prescient.Finally, this literature review claims to be up to date through October, 2018:www.uptodate.com/...""Treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients""...yet makes no mention of triferic or soluble ferric pyrophosphate.

They have multiple drugs that are early in their product life cycles that are doing remarkably well and have continued positive growth projections. These revenue projections are more than enough to compensate for Humira revenue slowdown in the future. Humira will do well through at least 2025. When it does slow, it will be slow. It is not like it will fall off a cliff!Mavrycet C, for hepatatis, is one of their newer drugs showing excellent market strength.

"This shouldn't be concerning to any Pet Insurance shareholder including Trupanion.  Once again the Capitolist grossly stretches the truth.  The NAIC conference is 5 days long and the P&C Committee meets on Saturday for 1.5 hours to discuss 13 agenda items, of which the Pet Insurance white paper will be heard.  1.5 hours / 13 agenda items = 6.9 minutes out of a 5-day conference to discuss the entire Pet Insurance marketplace.  I'm not sure how one could come to the above conclusion based on the facts.  As quoted below, the intent of the white paper was to provide an overview of the Pet insurance industry and to NOT make any regulatory or licensing recommendations. Again, for those who want accurate information, read the white paper titled, A Regulators Guide to Pet Insurance, published by the NAIC on Pet Insurance. Be sure to read the attached letters submitted by several Insurance companies that comment on the 10/31 draft as well as the introductory letter by Warren Byrd, Chair of the Committee.A couple of takeaways:1 - The committee is in the early stages of learning about the Pet Insurance business. Warren Byrd, Chair of the Committee writes in his letter:  During the 2018 Spring National Meeting, the Property and Casualty Insurance (C) Committee formed a drafting group to develop a white paper for regulators regarding pet insurance. Per the charge, “consider the development of a white paper reviewing the coverage options, product approval, marketing, rating, and claims practices related to pet insurance, the intent of the white paper is to provide an overview of pet insurance, not to make recommendations regarding data collection, regulation or licensing requirements.""Contrary to what the Capitolist would like you to believe, no decisions will be made this weekend or if ever. That was not the intent of the committee or white paper.2 - The are no alarms sounding off in the report. Many of the sources quoted in the report are being challenged by several Insurance companies as non-credible. This surely will be validated in the near future.3 - The P&C Insurance Committee is working hard to ensure a healthy marketplace in the fast-growing Pet Insurance space. Their job is to educate and make well-informed recommendations. They are smart enough to figure out who is short and who is long.The Report starts on page 58. Enjoy!www.naic.org/...",

"By looking at this graph regarding iphone sales between 2007 and 2018, we can clearly see that there is a well-defined pattern which shows that Q1 is when most sales occur, then goes sharply down in Q2 and Q3, then moves slightly up in Q4 and then sharply up again in next Q1.  Q1 2018  sales where lower than same quarter 2017, but Q2 Q3 and Q4 2018 were better than same quarters 2017. Now, if this pattern remains, we have nothing to worry, considering that other segments are dramatically improving and unit-sale prices have increased compared to previous i-phones.

when do you forsee the stock rising?,
How long to buy it all back say under 190,
Yes net cash 120+ billion and growing all the time and that means they can buy back 20% of the float. Want to bet against that?   Or the possibility Buffett might want another 5% of the company?   Then stay short AAPL and cross your fingers.,
"On AAPL buybacks. I am a longterm AAPL investor who has seen this kind of drop before and bought into it each time.  because of this, 2 months ago I was rich, and now am 20% less rich.  -  So far though we have not seen any noticeable buybacks from AAPL. Apparently they are waiting. But that could change any minute and when it does it will ressemble past falls and recoveries and go parabolic, wipe out shorts like lightning. In fact I bet we are back over 200 within a week assuming AAPL gets to work buying.  Yes technicians will say this and that support are broken, but AAPL buybacks eats technicians for lunch and there is simply no rational reason this stock should be selling at less than half the PE of MSFT.  -- I would also remind people that any time they want, AAPl can make tens of billions of extra profits. All they have to do is start advertising, and there are rumblings that this may be in the works. 'ethical"" advertising though not targeting from personal data. So maybe a Trump-China selloff like this kicks their dvertising strategy into high gear. We shall see.",
"Very bad month for AAPL, couldn't believe it went below 190 but foolishness exists at both extremes, at the top predicting 3 trillion market cap, and here at the presumed bottom with bears saying they'd buy at 175.  175?  That would be about a 12 PE for a company that knocks the cover off the ball every quarter.  I attribute this drop to Trump and his crazy 1970's era mentality trade tariffs war. he is the emperor with no clothes,a  real known-nothing rabble-rouser who doesn't give a damn if we all lose our retirement accounts. Thanks to the compliant GOP senate and congress they let one unqualified guy who lost the popular vote and now has a terrible approval number piss all over the entire global economy and except for that Navarro guy nobody agrees with anything he is doing. he  caved on the new NAFTA and got the US nothing and with the super complex supply chains there is no clear way of making a new China deal without the massive disruption and stock market crashes he is causing.  same over in europe.  As if any company in the US can make the best luxury cars, tesla aside. trump is just pissing all over the global economy, so then companies have to warn about this and shorts and bears clobber them.  Anyway, if trump gets out of the way, shuts up and just does nothing, this stock would be back to 230 pretty quickly and so would a lot of other stocks which have been victims of trump's anti trade anti global markets mentality.  But instead, investing in the best damn company on earth at a modest price becomes a big loser. we are all losers with trump around. Wall St needs to kick some ass in the GOP chambers and get rid of him. His trade wars cost us more than a trillion bucks already and it could get worse. That said, I am holding AAPl for many years and expect all this damage will be undone Trump or not within a relatively short time.",

"Note that Apple's management has stated their intention to operate with zero net cash position moving forward. AAPL has returned about $22B of their net cash to shareholders in FY18. This is in addition to about $50B of free cash flow that they return every year. They still have net cash of about $122B to be distributed. So in next 3 years, I see them returning about 12-15% of market cap from cash on balance sheet and another ~15% from CF generated each year. That sounds like a great bargain to me.Tim Cook is very shareholder friendly CEO.  Not many people know this but in 2013 he asked the board to change his time-vested options grant to a conditional performance-based options grant.

Netflix can sell their content to anybody, Apple is restricted to their installed base.  3. I understand the importance of growing the services business.

"I feel this antiApple action of late is way overdone. Over the years I  have witnessed much bigger corrections than the recent one. Wall street analysts (anal ists) are a flock of sheep and will follow each other over the cliff.  'Monkey see,  monkey do’. So many have reported that iPhone  sales are down without hearing this from the  source (Apple). Their source is always anonymous.This has happened before every earnings report, and  after the real report from Apple is released, these ’sheep’ are proven so wrong! They never  admit to their poor or false reporting after the fact. Check out the history. Short sellers gain when the stock price goes down therefore much of this false news is created to cause the price to go down. Figure it  out!",

Never mind Cook won't tell you how many Iphones were sold this quarter, they are making huge sums of money, buying back their stock and innovating  products and services for the future.In my opinion as an investor, Apple over time will out perform the market and make you a lot of money.

"I switched to Apple products after I had to buy a new laptop with Windows Vista. After 6 months I couldn't stand it anymore, and coincidentally the hard drive died on the thing. I switched ecosystems by getting a MacBook Pro. Then in 2015 my phone died, so I got an iPhone 6 Plus. Couldn't be happier with both devices - the MacBook still works after 10 years! I like my Apple products so much that I decided to invest in the stock. As a DGI investor, I don't like the yield but I really like the dividend growth rate.

"Big funds fear that we could see a top in revenue similar to 2015-2017 period.  Many companies have issued warnings about slower growth in 2019.  AAPL topped out around 132 in 2015 and bottomed out at 90 in 2016.  That's a 32% haircut.  Without additional tax cut, higher consumer optimism, lower unemployment, and lower interest rate, there is a very strong possibility that history will repeat, with AAPL trading under 158 in 2019.  I may accumulate between 130 and 150, but I wouldn't be an aggressive buyer until 90-100.  Buy the dip is very dangerous during a period of QT.The winner of stock buyback is the CEO.",

I have been saying for two years now that Tim Cook must be fired.  There is zero innovation coming out of Apple.  Tim Cook is lazy!  Him and Ives have not spoken for over 6 months.  Jony Ives is now creating full diamond rings selling for $250-350K.  His tenure at Apple is coming to an end.  I told you back in January that Apple cant close above $180 by year end.  I was wrong about Apple going higher than $180 this year because of options manipulation.  The option manipulators figured out another way to get Apple back down to under $180 and recover their massive $900 million loss when Apple closed above $180.,

"The drop in AAPl share price is fleeting but yesterday fortuitous for me. I got more shares from the dividend. The name of the game is more shares before you need to spend the money; it's a certainty that AAPL will be worth $300 someday. I hope that by then I will still be able to enjoy it to the fullest. Once you have a big pile of shares, the dividends keep you happy and the capital gains are less of an issue for you if you bought them before the 7:1 split. There is nothing to fear about Apple making money in the future; it's a question of how much. The Christmas present season will boost profits as it usually does.My only problem is my AAPL shares are becoming a large % of my total financial net worth so I'm not buying more shares (although the dividend does).",

"APPL is under pressure based on reduced metrics visibility, and more importantly, what that implies for future growth. AAPL wants the analyst community to focus on profitability, cash flow, and EPS. The later will naturally increase as Apple's buybacks continue to reduced the outstanding shares, thus increasing EPS. This is all valid. The analysts and institutional investors understand that there are competitive limits to increasing the profitability per I-Phone, via price increases, rather than cost of goods sold (COGS) decreases. A slowdown in future unit sales will ultimately lead to reduced profitability. Secondly, the services business is directly tied to I-Phone installed base growth. It is not yet an independent line of business, like the MAC or IPAD.Absent quarterly I-Phone shipment #'s, Investors and their analyst surrogates, are waiting for the company to demonstrate that revenue, gross margin, and EPS can expand without a commensurate increase in I-Phone sales.

I'm just wondering since VK 2809 reduced fat in NAFLD impressively in such a short period of 12 weeks wouldn't it make sense that over a longer trial the fat reduction would even be greater? So why would VKTX have to go directly after NASH instead of using 2809 as a preventive NAFLD and in effect be a preventive for NASH?By being the best NAFLD treatment they might dominate that market and maybe have no need for a NASH trial?,

When and how I wonder.Differentiate, add value as a music specialist, attract the core fans who are the opinion leaders and market makers... the rest follows.

"Oh, disappointed to see you going back to Spotify. Last article not a hot item really and so many Spotify articles around. The last one just four days ago, by Rob Koyfman, I blew up beyond recognition. But I'm not going to do anything so crass as to just cut and paste that here.Most who write about Spotify know little about the royalty end of the business. Which is too bad since it is by far the biggest expense and mostly controls whether you have a gain or a loss. I know the copyright stuff better than almost any here because I spent literally years following the Flo & Eddie v. Sirius and Pandora litigation in three states. Not many have a clue about the ""Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995."" I'm borrowing a little from myself:So the first problem that Spotify faces is the very high cost of licensing music. The base cost is 70 to 80 percent of gross revenue. I have read that Spotify some years has faced payments of over 90 percent, but I can't document that.According to industry sources, the on-demand digital service model typically carries a cost of about 70 percent of revenue for royalty payments, of which 60 percent of revenue pays for licensing master recording and 10.5 percent of revenue for publishing royalties. Yet, those percentages are what’s known as the headline rate; each set of licenses -- master recording and publishing -- are actually set by as many as three or four formulas and whichever one produces the biggest revenue pool is the one used to calculate royalties.So in 2016 Spotify gave the total cost of obtaining the music that it needed as 85 percent of revenue. (Spotify does not break down what part of the cost goes to paying royalties, but we know it to be at least 70 percent.) So that leaves them 15 percent for paying the very large salaries that management pays itself and leasing the extravagant office space in New York.So there you have it. Fifteen percent of revenue to play around with. The only digital broadcaster able to make any kind of a profit is SiriusXM, and they received special large breaks in royalties due to the new, expensive and risky business plan of launching multi-million dollar satellites, building out ground-based signal repeaters, and forcing almost every new car owner to have a free trial in his or her new auto.The second Sirius advantage was doing no on-demand streaming, which is unregulated by the government and vastly more expensive than shotgun streaming.The business does not scale well because each new subscriber brings new bills from the copyright holders who license the music that the new subscriber plays.And with Spotify crying out for a raise in subscription fees, Apple and Amazon and Google can all subsidize the price of the music service long enough to defeat Spotify. Apple is already offering a six month free sub with purchase of its smart speaker and Amazon with the sale of a premium music subscription throws in $48.99 worth of cash to be spent on Echo products.I will say that I'm only focused on the U.S. and I don't know what wonders will happen for Spotify outside the States. I would assume that the third world consumers would have less cash, but cost of doing business may be less.Eliminating the fat and happy record label middle men would be the ultimate solution. But if you can start something like signing recording artists directly starting this year, it doesn't help for the millions of songs over many decades that the record labels have in their sweaty little hands.I read in one or two places that broadcasting music has never been a very profitable business due to the high costs of obtaining the product.

"How do you know that the revenue and earnings figures you quote are accurate? This is not a company under US accounting rules or the SECs jurisdiction. You are taking the numbers for fact but be careful. This is not the US and my experience doing business with Chinese companies is that they keep many sets of books and accounting is very loose (20 years exporting experience from china, and many times I have been told about the different books by Chinese company owners. We were trying to get to cost plus quoting and that was humorous at best.)",
Why has this analysis not calculated the many billions of investments BABA has made in numerous countries ? These are huge losses now but potentially will turn around like Amazon did.,
Impossible (for me) to predict the bottom. Prob less expensive to average up instead when US-China deal is done. Just that I won’t catch the bottom,

Baba has the same net income as amazon generating much less revenue per year. Baba’s growth y/y is much higher. This tells us Baba is much more profitable while the growth story is still in the 4th inning. Baba has about 1/2 the market cap.

"I like FTDR too and would also go along with a midteens EBITDA multiple valuation. It operates in a sector which is under-represented in the public market. Look  at ANGI, which operates in the much broader Home Services market  trades in the mid to high 20X range forward EBITDA arguably reflective of its status as a fairly unique investment proposition servicing an industry segment which is not currently well represented in the publicly traded markets and in which it is an industry leader with a growing addressable market currently estimated to be worth $400 BN. The Home Warranty business is a much smaller sub-sector within the HomeServices business generating ~ $2.5 BN or <1% of the entire Homeservices market.  FTDR’s unrivalled scale (46% market share) within that small segment, its relatively sticky business model, and attractive growth profile are all pluses in the investment thesis.However, if I were to play devil's advocate, there a couple of factors that may have to play themselves out before FTDR can earn investor trust and reach a more appropriate valuation: 1) It is one of the cardinal sins for a new company to cut its guidance within weeks of its listing - it raises question marks over management's credibility - starting off on the wrong foot leaves no wiggle room for further missteps, so the next few quarters are critical  and  2) Claims cost is a wild card in FTDR's business model and it may take several quarters to guage how successfully the company is addressing the issue A third point  is that SERV still holds 19.9% of FTDR which it intends to sell down overtime- this can be done in an orderly fashion, but for now it remains a potential overhang on the share price.",

Near term risks may include a decline in housing sales with a rise in interest rates, but i am thinking inflation fears may be off the mark and the recent rise in rates will subside as growth declines. Competition may be a concern. Amazon has been moving into the space a bit, but if they were to get serious about this same space, an acquisition might make sense.

"Ironically, it is advances in biotechnology which have brought General Electric to the edge of bankruptcy.  And a willful refusal to address the consequences of these advances, until 2017, left the company with a $9.5 billion pre-tax charge to earnings in 4Q17, with likely another shocker coming as a result of the “premium deficiency testing” to be completed in the current quarter (presumably to be revealed to stockholders next February).  For those few GE investors who don’t know what I am talking about, the issue is the cost of servicing long term care contracts.Note #12 to the latest GE 10Q  for 3Q18 (page 88) spells it out.  It turns out that policy holders are costing far more in claims than GE expected, when it sold them long-term-care policies decades ago.  Mostly, this because fewer customers are dying from sudden strokes and heart attacks.  Because of new (and old) medications which lower blood pressure and reduce cholesterol, the customers are living longer and dying from cancer and other causes which can involve much heavier costs from long-term care.  And now the PD/1 inhibitors and other biotech advances are enabling longer survival for many diseases.  Unfortunately for GE, relatively few of the new drugs lead to actual cures, so that for GE the net result of biotech advances is to further burden the company with ever-heavier costs.It is difficult to guess what the ultimate exposure of GE stock holders will turn out to be.  Simple actuarial computations based on mortality tables are essentially useless.  Much better are computations based on actual experience trends, which appears to be the basis for the expectation of another $11 billion hit through 2024 as described in Note #12.  It’s doubtful whether GE will have the stomach, or the willingness, to re-compute and reveal to stockholders a better LTC exposure guess, which would probably have to be based on a disease-by-disease prognosis, tied to the makeup of the policyholder base.The raw numbers involved in this biotech-triggered debacle far outweigh any biotech profits to be achieved by GE’s equipment-heavy  Health Care sector.",

"Although I agree that single use processing equipment for the preparation of biotech drugs is a nice market to be in, it's a big stretch to pin your hopes on it for being a significant source of salvation for GE. This technology has been commercially available for more than a decade and GE is but one player in this very competitive space.  In 2017 the global market was $9B and projected to grow 12-13% annually over the next 5 years. Let's assume that GE currently has a 30% market share. This would bring GE's top line with the product line from $2.7B in 2017 to roughly $5B in 2022.

"Not true in engines. Facts are that this business has successfully employed the IofT to create the best maintenance and just in time replacement of spares in the busness. It realized the great business potential in the after market and had the conviction, talent and implementation capability to make it happen. The lion’s share of its profit now comes from servicing the after market rather than original equipment sales. This business is more representative of the old GE, it largely  resisted the manager is a manager personnel policy, promoted from within and has generally been led by managers who grew up in the business, To some extent gas turbines and transportation have also deployed leading edge software and support systems. These businesses didn’t resist the manager is a manager philosophy as successfully and have suffered somewhat from being driven by management that often did not grow up in the business. The rest of what was GE was a different story. Even healthcare had too many rotations of high pots from elsewhere and for a time lost sight of customer service.The IofT effort Immelt pushed, i’m convinced grew out of the success of the engine folks. Unfortunately, its focus seemed not to address the application implementation enough and at its heart it focused on building a software set of products that apparently was thought to be sellable to other companies without the systems people to hand hold the prospective customers. This weakness was also obvious in the computerized patient records software GE Healthcare pioneered and then sold because it didn’t grow as thought.",
"""You cannot assume that GE will get anything close to fair value for any assets they sell. GE is a forced seller, and buyers realize it.""I actually feel the opposite.  I think GE destroys value.

As such, if GE tried to sell a briefcase containing $10,000, they would only be able to get about $2,000 for it. What's more, they're not too good at negotiating - at least if you go by the prices on their recently announced dispositions. No, I still feel that GE stock is expensive at these levels given the (1) enormous debt load, (2) the massive pension liabilities that GE works so hard to keep off the books, (3) GE's lack of access to the capital markets, and (4) the fact that credit default swaps on GE capital are rising so fast and have gone so far that it seems almost obvious that GE capital is likely to be facing a serious liquidity drain or possibly even a solvency event. The picture that the CDS market paints is what you might expect if GE capital had a serious hedge go wrong.

"Franklja, you know from reading my comments over the last year and a half that I haven’t left out criticism of the IofT effort, I often asked during that time what was the business plan, how was the effort organized and who was responsible for the projected 12B in new revenue by 2020. Recall the original number was 15B and adjusted to 12B by Flannery. I posted the results of my conversation with the GE stockholder relations executive early this year, in which I asked those questions. After challenging his first answer, he allowed that sales  were 1B to date. If you go back into my comments, you will find that I was very skeptical about GE’s ability to achieve the claims and had disagreement with much of the community about the big potential and GE’s role in it. You will find my discussions with Mike , whereby we disagreed. In recent history, Flannery changed the sales focus from the general market to GE’s own products, then he rightly changed the 2020 goal because of double cutting. Now, the whole area is not discussed at all. My view is that Immelt  and his merry men never really had a comprehensive operational plan for the business. First they spent beaucoup money building an operating system, put it on the micro soft cloud and went about marketing it to outside companies. Then they realized that that approach wasn’t  user friendly enough and went out and bought small companies to build Apps and other user aids. Obviously, the business didn’t grow as envisioned, I suspect for several reasons,none the least of which was that new applications  of the system required to benefit from this approach needed hand holding application people to successfully apply the new maintenance and logistics system that would achieve those envisioned benefits.The digital twin concept and the innovative just in time maintenance system built around such machinery was pioneered by the engine folks and was in operation long before the IofT was so universally envisioned by the community at large. To make it  the success it is in engines, it took  software capability, knowledge of engine design, a system in place for monitoring each engine in its operating environment and management conviction and foresight to believe in the resulting revenue and profit benefit.  To make this happen in another company’s product is at best a slow process and in general one that requires knowledgeable application people working with equipment modelers and  in house maintenance folks to accomplish. My view from the outside is that I didn’t see where GE set up the organizational profile to make outside sales successful. As usual during Immelt’s tenure, the devil was in the operational details and there are a lot of steps between a concept and creating a viable new, on going business which involve more than spending money or acquiring seed companies.",

If they do that, some parts of the company will flourish and the investor who has several shares (BHGE, Heathcare, and remnant GE at a minimum, maybe more splits) will benefit  But if they don't cut the company apart, I think it will continue to be mismanaged.  True spins just enable the freedom that some parts of the company can change in ways we don't even know now.",

@Jeremy Blum Jeremy please answer the following for me to check your logic. 1. Is the division income ie Aviation after deducting interest expense?2. Is the PE multiple you chose taking into account interest expense on ie Aviation?My problem understanding your valuation is you use all in PE's to choose the division PE ie Aviation PE 25. The GE division earnings is not all in because you do not know the interest expense or the taxes. The comparable PE's have already accounted for these items and the market has determined their PE ratio's. I believe we both agree GE does not revel that information on on division basis (except Capital}. Am I wrong?,
General Electric is quite likely a turn around play.If they are able to right the ship it will quite likely take some time. That said the upcoming transactions will hopefully give us some insight into how things will possibly play out.As 2018 wraps up General Electric is currently not on my list of holdings to harvest capital losses from.,
"Reasonable analysis, the stock is probably getting close to a bottom here. Might be time to noble a little.",
Take your numbers and cut in half for overvaluation and it's about right.,
"I think you may have missed a significant reason for the continued slide in price.  Trust.  GE just doesn't have any left.  People keep waiting for that last big shoe to drop, but the accounting seems to have a centipede quality.  Until investors are confident that ALL of the Welch/Immelt  skeletons have finally been purged I don't think GE goes anywhere.  Sometimes culture can cripple a company.  I think this is one of those times.",
Why are you not including GE Capital debt in the sum of parts equation?? Seems like you get that Debt off the tally??,
are you worried the credit default swaps exploding? Usually the bond guys are the masters of figuring out the sum of the parts.,
JBThanks for your complete analysis. Of course GE is worth more split that as a conglomerate. Hard to get a handle and the market always assume the worst.There is anyway to create two separate entities like HP and float the stock of the separate entities?,
"Nicely done.The sotp value of $13.60 would otherwise be an inducement to nibble at the current stock price.  As stated by others on this thread, i remain concerned that the Legal / Accounting / Tax skeletons that will no doubt surface will take years to find and untangle before any break up plan can be monetized.  A lot of bad stuff can happen in a few years to a well reasoned and carefully structured corporate dismemberment.  Too risky - gotta be better value elsewhere!",
@Jeremy Blum Using my logic I arrive at a value of about $8.27 per share. I tried to build on your logic. Where we differ is I believe you failed to take into account the interest on the debt in the divisions. I understand that GE hides this. To arrive a a better valuation number I believe that you need to take the 102 Billion in debt at 5.5% (which is subtracted from earning in the real world) and would amount to about 5.6 billion dollars in interest expense an multiply it times a an average PE multiple for GE which i will pull out of the air at 50% of aviation or 12.5. The 12.5 times the interest 5.6 billion interest gives 70 billion dollar reduction in net market value. Using your net market value of  $142 billion minus the interest expense reduction of 70 billion leaves 72 billion in net market value. 72 Billion divided by shares outstanding leaves $8.27 per share in stockholder value. This is a rough sketch which I believe you will refine if you understand and agree with my logic. Looking forward to your comments.My best to you. I remain short GE.,
It's Siemens and not Siemans btw...,
"@Jeremy Blum , You did a lot of work on this article and it shows. I have a few questions on your assignment of a 25 PE to aviation. I understand why you assigned it but did you fail to consider the debt/interest charge to this division? Assume this division has 10 billion in debt which is at the corporate level and this debt cost 5.5% that would amount to 550 million dollars in interest expense should the division earnings not be reduced by that number. Another way to put it is 25PE times 550 million = a 13.75 billion dollar reduction in valuation from aviation. The same would apply to your logic to all of GE. You have only eliminated the debt and not the interest PE multiplier on GE interest expense. Interest expense which will increase as rates rise. I may be wrong but I believe GE debt is only one check above losing investment grade.Have I misunderstood your logic?",
"GE has eliminated pensions for some years now. Also I thought I heard that GE lighting has been sold to private investors. I also suspect the split of power into the gas generator business and the all other is a forerunner to getting rid of most of the poison pills acquired in the Alstom Acquisition. This acquisition , the stock buy backs ,The BHI DEAL  and the sale of major appliances might easily go down in the annals of corporate history as among the worst decisions corporate management has made. Retention of the GE logo by the Chinese buyers of large appliances and the retention of that logo on locomotives by Wabtec says much about the GE management of those businesses. The buyers value the name and believe the business is viable in contrast to the GE corporate leaders who think the legacy businesses are non-core, too small a margin or not enough growth in their crystal ball. This while they use investment dollars to shore up a renewable windmill business whose margins are shrinking and have not even come close to the transportation or healthcare businesses.",
If Aviation were a stand alone unit today is would be trading at a premium PE.,

ONE of its divisions has had trouble, and over the last 3 quarters, excluding a tax trick (Goodwill write-off) it actually has made a tiny profit. The sheer insanity has been driven mainly by one malicious man- Stephen Tusa! He's only been right because he can get the market into a tizzy over his pronouncements from the ivory tower.",
"Why was GE the conglomerate too hard to value for years. Now that vultures are circling, everybody knows exactly what each division is worth? I smell BS.",
"Is it accurate to value these divisions on 9-mos of operations.  Shoudn't TTM be used?Q4 2017 had some pretty low revenues for some of the industrials, and GE Capital had losses in Insurance and Energy.",
"My view:critically missing are:- Corporate costs. Best practice is to take 6-8x these costs. 35k highly paid pen-pushers must cost easily $6bn a year. At best you remove $36bn from your sotp, or even $50bn.- conglomerate discount: we see with the block sale of Baker Hughes, there is little liquidity for GE to sell in the market. Removing 10-15% is a minimum. In GE’s case, due to the abysmal capital allocation, 20-25% would be justifiedEt voilà! We have done a sotp with the current share price, with further downside in GE Cap being offset by probbaly a too low valuation of AviationPS: look outside the borders a bit. Aviation has a JV partner in Safran. Rolls Royce is also another listed peer. Same in Healthcare. The big 3 include Siemens and Philips. Not Medtronic.",
"@Jeremy Blum With all due respect to your fine article (which I really did enjoy) - you lost me at the valuation of Capital at $0.There's little question that it's worth $0, but the real question is how much LESS than $0.The fact that its accounting was allowed to be co-mingled with industrials is a crime.It's the off balance sheet items over there that I'm willing to bet is (and has been) what is eating this company alive from the inside.. . . the place is a pit of derivative toxic waste and bad gambling debts.",
"Perfect example of why not to buy and hold forever. Times change although most of their wounds were self inflicted. Siemens is a good comparison in Healthcare, Renewables, and Power. No jet engines at Siemens though. GE is probably worth more than $8 but it is not a sure thing. Too many unknowns such as pensions and litigation. Maybe in a year there will be more information.",
I have a question.  If GE is split will the shareholders get stock in the split companies or will it be a sale and proceeds used to pay debt and shareholder left with nothing?  I apologize if this sounds like a stupid question,
"Good analysis, thanks.  I have several quibbles, but the PE on Aviation is the big one.  It's not like GE is going to branch out and start making millions of tiny jet engines for iPhones (though perhaps they'll get into electric aircraft propulsion?).  I'd say 25 PE there is pretty high.… and that's assuming the jets don't start throwing blades like the power turbines in which case look out mama ...",
"lastly, if GE can massage power into something that is not bleeding money, then the rest of the ship will hold water nicely..pumps will clear the bilge out in time.the Power Division is what brought GE to the edge of the cliff...the Alstom acquisition was a horrendous blunder, ill timed and far over paid...I suggest that perhaps a joint venture with Siemens - at least with the Alstom projects, might spread out the costs and ultimately make GE money in that region...one must wonder why on earth Immwit was hell bent on that purchase...top dollar for an over used car that won't start and flat tires..a drunk ego maniac move.",
"If GE is to survive, they need to start by getting rid of all the dead-weight. Even as revenues tanked and they sold businesses, the number of employees has remained at a ridiculously high above 300,000 number. It's tough to go anywhere with a stone around your neck.At this point, there doesn't seem to be any value in having the corporate layer overhead. Splitting up the company would be beneficial for all.",

"Jeremy, your analysis is okay, except for one huge mistake. You are subtracting out debt for GE after pricing its worth based on comparable companies' P/E ratios, when those companies themselves carry NON-ZERO debt! Example, Aviation you value at 126 billion based on P/E. Fair enough. If the debt load assigned to GE were average for that sector, then the value of Aviation alone would be worth ~$14.6/ share! Granted, GE debt is higher than aerospace industry average, so you can discount it, but still, it's worth at least $12/ share. The same calculations apply to the other sectors. I actually value GE at over $20 share.",
"The only parts I am interested in are jet engines and MRI machines.Long $GE and buying more in the sub $6 range, with several well placed trip wire hero price limit orders for maximum savagery",
"Question on methodology: using Aviation as an example.  A PE ratio of comparable companies is determined, and a rough guess at the standalone value is thereby determined.  How much debt to the comparable companies have?  Does it matter for the purposes of this calculation?  Later in the calculation, certain liabilities are subtracted (underfunded pensions, long term debt, etc.).  Were similar things subtracted from the comparable companies when determining their value, with the intention to determine Aviation's value?  If not, why is this methodology defendable?  Possibly an approach using Enterprise Value to EBIT might be more defendable?  This is leaving aside GE Capital.  The presumption that GE Capital has a zero value seems extremely generous.  I suspect that GE would sell the whole thing for $0 in a heartbeat if they could get the buyer to take the liabilities along with it.  My assumption is that the market is valuing GE Capital at something on the order of negative $50 B (as a very rough guesstimate).  I agree with the author that there is value in GE Power; it needs major adjustment but there is true value there.  I enjoyed reading this, but I think the methodology is seriously flawed such that, if the $13.90 target is accurate, it is simply a fortunate accident.",

Well done.  Took a small stab below $8.

"Excellent work. Lots of insight. I’ll take your word for the $ presented and feel the comparison to other businesses is a valid approach. I’ve commented for some time that a break-up makes sense. There is no longer a positive impact on each unit from being part of a poorly managed conglomerate. It looks like if GE announced it was going down this path, the stock would immediately double. I worked for Rockwell as it went through it’s break-up. Shareholder value increased substantially. Each unit either liquidated or easily transformed into a profitable going concern. But it took Don Beal several years to get it done right. Maybe it’s finally time to push the buy button.",

"Author:1. the stock price has obviously been on a downward trend for the last year and a half, which one could logically attribute to the fact that the company isn't selling any Symjepi.  You may be correct in speculating that there will be a short term spike based on your technical view, but I wouldn't recommend touching this stock now. The mid- and long term trend is clearly down -- not a good time to buy. I was an owner of shares until the generic epipen came out.  Now I speculate the market (and margins) for Symjepi will be small -- not a good sign.2. the notion that ADMP management will submit NDAs for Nox injector and sublingual Cialis by year end (according to Carlo) is IMO absurd.  Carlo claims in the earnings report that they have finished the trial of sub. Cialis effects recently.  I would so love to see that data.  He doesn't tell us anything about the trial design, or the results.  Perhaps if you are day trader you might make some money on this one, but I strongly recommend to the rest of you to stay away from this one until something substantial occurs -- namely some real money coming in from Symjepi sales.  I have absolutely no confidence in ADMP R&D under Carlo direction, so I therefore consider the Carlo claims of sub.Cialis testing, NDA submissions, etc. to be complete BS, until the time when talk turns into tangible results.",

Launch it in a bear market..more than likley to blame everything on the market. I mean, Symject technology has not even launched yet and Carlo decided to work on Nox and cialis. Would you not want to know how well your technology is recieved before you start filling them with more quick products.  Look at the $3 Million expired inventory. If Carlo had any integrity, he would give up his year pay which is equal to the lost inventory. But we know that its not Carlo then. Delaying product on purpose. Submitting them in december, knowing that the company will run out of money in july, august, and action date for Nax will be in september. More dilution while they give longs waiting shareholders lollipop of nda action next september. Hence, collecting another year of pay. And I am sure they will ask for bonus shares at share holder meeting...Definitely looking forward to that! Everytime an analyst writes a bullish thesis, the stock makes a new low. Honestly, waiting on lawsuits now to find out what exactly happened.",
"You are absolutely right being a yo yo game; however, the yo has been falling lower and lower everytime, trapping more naive investors along the way. I mean, anyone in senses will think that Symjepi will launch at a time when there is a shortage for Epi pen; it only makes sense. However, missing out on a 5quarter plus",
"Joe$ - FBR Riley ADMP downgrade is really really bad and it is a sign of things to come for the foreseeable future. I expect ADMP announce bankruptcy next year if they continue to dilute without producing any revenue, if USC business continues to lose money.Adamis has not produced any revenue since 2010, so they purchased USC business to show some revenue in the earnings report. USC business was plagued with FDA recalls when they bought. CEO misguided to investors (read April 2016 company PR) saying ""$50 mill revenue run rate within 24 months of acquisition & $5 mil net income first year of acquisition"". He said this despite knowing all the USC issues, lagging sales. Product pipeline means NOTHING. Look at SYMJEPI. It's been 18 months since approval, ZERO sales. So, similarly each product in the pipeline is years away from generating any revenue (if approved). Until then DILUTION.DILUTION. DILUTION.",
"Joe$- Adamis stock has been in downtrend for over 2 years. Very Very bearish sign. Probably, investors expect bankruptcy soon ? That is a real possibility knowing what happened to SGYP, 3 products on the market with $40 mil revenue. Adamis has $0 SYMJEPI revenue 18 months after FDA approval.What happened to NEOS - 3 products on the market and $37 mil revenue.COMPETITION in a highly crowded market with lots of dominant players.SYMJEPI will have plenty of competition and even more when they actually launch the product because in my opinion SYMJEPI is inferior, clunky, third rate, manual injection which retail consumer will hate. Retail consumers will always prefer autoinjector.",
"Apples and Oranges. TEVA has a generic epipen, rival to Mylan. No one has a syringe like ADMP. Apples and oranges. ADMP and Sandoz aren’t waiting on TEVA . But, what is wrong with owning both?",
"Listen to me everybody - the issue with formulary is - TEVA generic pricing. Sandoz needs to know TEVA generic price before starting it's formulary process for SYMJEPI. Price is one of the product parameters listed on the formulary.Formulary approval takes 3 - 6 months. Riley Analyst thinks, Sandoz will have tough time getting SYMJEPI on formularies  for FULL SCALE LAUNCH In 1h2019. I feel Riley analyst is absolutely reasonable and spot on with his analysis. B. Riley always had the most conservative price target of all analysts that covered Adamis for last 2 years and he has been correct all along. Raymond James, MAXIM Group, HC WainWright all have been wrong with their price targets on Adamis.The worst of the bunch is Maxim Group. They set $10 price target in Aug, 2016 (& talked to barrons about ADMP. There is article in barrons about that). Then, they downgraded to $5 AND THEN immediately raised to $13 price target. Jason Kolbert was analyst back then who now works at HC Wainwright and has $7 price target since.Raymond James is relatively respectful name on wall street but , man, they pretend to not know formulary approval process, pretended to not expect TEVA generic approval. Dishonest at best.In my opinion, Raymond James & other analysts will soon downgrade Adamis once the launch does not happen after 6 months of deal announcement.",
"Correct me if you disagree:1. B. Riley's ""analysis"" that some problem exists with formulary listing/insurance reimbursement is rank speculation, and is not represented to be based on any real information. A stab in the dark.2. That said, we all are looking for some explanation for the incredible delay in getting Symjepi to market. Even so, guessing is not productive or helpful.3. If the ""formulary listing/insurance reimbursement"" is in fact the reason for the delay, isn't it GREAT news that Sandoz is in charge of this (instead of Adamis and their poor management team)? In other words. .  the very difficult part (FDA approval for normal and junior versions of Symjepi) is done. Now, the adults (Sandoz) are working out the formulary listing/insurance reimbursement . . . and, if any group on the planet is competent to work that out in a fast and professional manner. . it's Sandoz/Novartis (and NOT ADMP)!I look forward to your comments.",

It sounds like they will also begin clinical trials of their next iteration of migraine drugs early next year.  And there is also always the possibility of a buyout (though at current levels I think the majority of stakeholders see a much greater return holding out for the long term).

"Good interview. What was the date of the interview with Fred?  I own shares in EGD and IPT. EGD seems to be in better shape now than it was a few years ago, yet the market cap is less than half. They are not as reliant on mineral or oil drilling as they used to be. Seems the margins are getting better as well. Fred sounded very optimistic and he is not a BS'er.If there was a danger of going BK then Fred would have done a private placement to raise some cash. Fred is an accountant and knows the ins and outs of how to manage debt.",
"Gotta feel for Fred Davidson. He is a hard working and innovative CEO. But mineral and energy drilling is cyclical and can make a CEO cry at the bottom of the cycle. Unfortunately, both oil sands and mineral drilling died at the same time. The hope was they would be at least a little offsetting, but did not happen. Bummer.It was a close thing financially for Energold in the mineral drilling downturn. They had to do some very expensive debt financing and issued a lot of warrants and other incentives to get the debt financing done. In my opinion, your article badly needs a review of the debt and preferred shares and warrants and options situation at Energold. It is also crucial to do some analysis on what the bankruptcy risks are if we fail to get a recovery in mineral and/or oil sands drilling. Energold may not be able to attract additional financing if we get another global downturn.Mineral drilling is cyclical, and I agree that it looks like we are coming out of the bottom of the cycle. Major Drilling has seen improving revenues and they are a large player in the industry, so that supports the idea that the industry may be starting in on a cyclical upturn. Also base metal inventories are getting to very low levels at the LME and Comex and there has not been much green or brownfield mine development. Gold, which is the 800lb gorilla, is still somewhat depressed. We may be starting to see some sovereign and private debt level crises around the world (Turkey, Argentina, Venezuela, Nigeria, etc) which could kick gold prices up. I am optimistic about the mineral drilling side of the business.We were starting to see some recovery in oil prices. Lately that has reversed, but the reversal may be temporary. Canadian oil sands supposedly need $65 to $70 oil (from memory - not sure of that) to be profitable. The second big problem for Canadian oil sands is a shortage of pipeline capacity out of the region. If oil prices recover above $65 and the proposed pipelines actually get built, Energold should see a very strong recovery in their Bertram unit. But those are big ifs.Their newer businesses look like very smart moves (hydrovac, water, geothermal, directional, etc). Those should not be cyclical and there is demand for those services.Have owned EGD for a long time. At the moment it is still a pretty high risk bet. But if they can pay off the debt and preferred stock, mineral drilling recovers, and their new businesses gain traction, the upside is huge. My bet is Davidson pulls it off.",Profiling Energold Drilling And IMPACT Silver With CEO Fred Davidson

"SQ barrier to entry is low, competitions is all over the place in the SME space. It is a land for grab so profitability is not the first priority for such a Co. Any multiples on earnings is meaningless hence market look at it on turn of revenues. SQ trades on over 18 x sales for a business that is expected to growth its top line at c40% p.a. SQ is profitable but if one adjusts with Stock Compensation margins are low. Acquisition cost of clients is not cheap and a client on will need to stay with SQ a couple of years . No obvious given fees per transaction level and others service such as Fintech lending is interesting but again crowded and still small. Depending on growth rate, profitability level and FCF level, the market assign between 0.2 x to 0.4 sales per percentage of growth, so in the case of SQ at 40% top line growth, you get between 8 x to 16x sales. Currently, SQ is on c18x ( peak was c26x!). My view is that the turn of sales should more around the low end for Square. So, a long was to go down indeed. If one assumes margin will double within the next 5 years and keep 40% top line over the period and gives an exit multiple of 8 x the revenue in year 5, stock is around fair value. Yes you can read it again twice, it is how far the market went ahead, extrapolating the new Eldorado! Do not worry, SQ is not alone in this space, valuation will not only have to fall but also to normalise to more realistic level, I.e. The turn of Rev per percentage of growth will likely halve, looking at history and transaction multiples so 0.2/0.4 x will become possibly 0.1/0.2x . The scary thing is that multiples are bubbly and expectation are very high leaving no scope for disapointments. Good luck to long!",
"@Mark Hake am I wrong or you compared EV/Sales of Sq that are ""adjusted sales"" (so lower than Sales) to EV/Sales (not adj) of other peers? If so, obviously you'll find a higher multiple but it's not correct. Second, SQ does not trade yet EBITDA and Earnings multiples. The street is actually looking at Ebitda margin and growth, because SQ has to start trading on EBITDA and this is (one of) the turning point(s) of this stock. Growth must stay on Revenues and be trasferred to EBITDA.",

"I think the author @Mark Hake did a decent job of representing ratios, though many are not applicable for this type of growth stock benefiting from the Network Effect.It's appropriate that Mark used EV/Revenues (the best measure in my view) but then he used faulty logic by looking for high margins.  Sometimes, companies' margins actually Decline when they see their growth opportunities EXPANDING.  This is what Facebook did as soon as it went public.  They told people their costs would rise sharply b/c they foresaw good growth ahead.  Amazon did this too, etc..Is SQ overvalued?  It sure is, but not as much as you might think.

The 2013 dip was particularly sweet because the talk (i.e., the sentiment) got real negative and shares could be had for a song.Gimme that again.Here's one thing to think about: AAPL is going to continue to grow, but the rate of growth will likely slow.  However, the number of users plugged into their ecosystem by then will be so large that the size of their ""cash crank"" will be enormous.   These guys are going to crank out so much cash over the next 10 years - it's going to be a value investors dream come true.Long AAPL.",
"I am stunned that the stock has been so battered recently.  Here is the real news: Over the weekend Alibaba reported a record singles day with sales at 30.9 billion in a 24 hour period VS 25 billion last year.  Guess what the number 1 selling phone was in China?  That's right, the iPhone.  This is real data that suggests that Apple is currently killing it in China.  That the Chinese OEM's are not gaining ground on Apple.  That the slowing economy and stock market correction in China has not dramatically impacted the Chinese consumer.  This is REAL NEWS, not the FUD of extrapolation from the supply chain which Cook has denounced time and time again and has proven  to be wrong to use as a proxy for iPhone unit sell-through time and time again. Further, CNBC had Dan Niles on after the big Apple sell-off on Monday.  Niles is an Apple bear and was beating the drum on the same old tired bear arguments on Apple.  This guy was a sell-side tech analysts and still doesn't understand Apple.  He was babbling about the smart phone industry hitting maturity for the first time ever in 2018.   How Apple can't possibly grow revenues in a flat to declining overall smart phone market.  How Apple is still up 15% for the year and the S & P is only up 2% and that Apple should be up less than the S & P.  He also cited the decelerating growth of Apples services business to 27% most recently.  Really? Apple just reported a quarter with revenues up 20% YOY and earning up 40% YOY. How many S & P 500 companies are growing at that pace? Apples services business alone is a fortune 100 company and still growing at almost a 30% annual clip.  How many fortune 100 companies are doing that?  He also forgot to mention that Apple doesn't sell at a premium to the S & P.  He also neglects to understand that Apple can continue to grow unit sales within a flat to declining smart phone market for many, many years since they only have 15% of the global market share and people continue to move up the aspirational ladder each year.  Not to mention Apples huge installed base of well over 1 billion were more and more people are leasing from Apple directly and getting a new phone each year.  This will ultimately contract the refresh cycle over time.  Apple is a residual income platform company selling at a ridiculous discount to consumer product companies selling with p/e's of 25 and higher.  Consumer product companies that have anemic to no growth.  I have owned Apple for a very long time.  I have seen these FUD cycles come and go.  This one is weak without a shred of real data to suggest anything is wrong with iPhone sales.  This is a back up the truck opportunity.",
"I am concerned that Apple won't be offering 5G capable phones until 2020.  If that is true, many people will postpone spending $1,000 on a new phone in 2019.  Competitors are planning to offer 5G phones in 2019.  What are the odds Apple will do the same?",

"LITE warned about reduced orders and every ""analyst"" decided that Apple was now dooooomed!!!Apple bought into FINSAR to control their facial recognition supply line earlier in the year. Naturally, they moved away from LITE.Also the Xr orders were reduced...Now; is everyone bypassing the Xr to get the XsMax?? If you do the math on a month to month Apple upgrade program the cost difference between the Xr and Xs series amount to about $2 per day. Skip 4 Starbucks visits a month and pay for your iPhone Xs.......Don't forget the Apple Upgrade plan also REQUIRES AppleCare be purchased so the Services bottom line will go higher as well.ASP and Services revs are going much higher. TC and Warren B are buying AAPL shares as we speak so the share reductions will increase the stats as well. This Holiday quarter will be the biggest in Apple history.Remember the turkey farm analogy-- sell a 1000 at $1 profit or 700 at $2.....From Williasp---- Never understood the worry over somewhat declining sales in the face of higher asp’s. Would you rather own a turkey farm that sells 1000 turkeys on which it makes $1 per turkey, or would you rather own the farm that sells 700 turkeys at a profit of $2 each?

We have checked with dozens of vet clinics and have written proof that many are actively and explicitly recommending Trupanion to those who ask about pet insurance.,
"For those who want accurate information, read the white paper titled, A Regulators Guide to Pet Insurance, published by the NAIC on Pet Insurance.  This paper (and comments) will be discussed this Saturday by the Property and Casualty Insurance Committee.  Be sure to read the attached letters submitted by several Insurance companies that comment on the 10/31 draft as well as the introductory letter by Warren Byrd, Chair of the Committee.  A couple of takeaways:1 - The committee is in the early stages of learning about the Pet Insurance business.  Warren Byrd, Chair of the Committee writes in his letter: ""During the 2018 Spring National Meeting the Property and Casualty Insurance (C) Committeeformed a drafting group to develop a white paper for regulators regarding pet insurance. Per thecharge, “consider the development of a white paper reviewing the coverage options, productapproval, marketing, rating, and claims practices related to pet insurance,” the intent of the whitepaper is to provide an overview of pet insurance, not to make recommendations regarding datacollection, regulation or licensing requirements.""Contrary to what the Capitolist would like you to believe, no decisions will be made this weekend or if ever.  That was not the intent of the committee or white paper.    2 - The are no alarms sounding off in the report.  Many of the sources quoted in the report are being challenged by several Insurance companies as non-credible.  This surely will be validated in the near future.  3 - The P&C Insurance Committee is working hard to ensure a healthy marketplace in the fast-growing Pet Insurance space.  Their job is to educate and make well-informed recommendations.  They are smart enough to figure out who is short and who is long.  The Report starts on page 58.  Enjoy!www.naic.org/...",

Short positions don't pay for themselves, you know.I think this is a binary play (price lower or much higher than current):a) Either regulators decide to slow down growth in the medical insurance for cats and dogs industry, because terrible, terrible violation of rules - how dare anybody have a preference for the services of one specific company!b) They decide an industry that helps people budget for catastrophic medical emergencies of their beloved pets, which has a market penetration of less than 2%, shouldn't unnecessarily be hampered.Which sounds more likely?",
"Thanks for highlighting this.However I heavily doubt that a regulator does a U-Turn on regulating TRUP‘s sales force (which is your basic assumption for your short case) after they stood by watching and nodding off TRUP building it up that way for 15+ys. There is also positives to TRUPs efforts (building up a category) which the regulator might appreciate on the other hand especially as customers profit from cheaper access to insurance.I‘ll wait that decision out before losing my head about potential regulatory actions which are by themselves unforseeable in their amount as well as their direction.

Thanks for the interesting article - at first glance getting a major airport operator at 9-10x EV/EBITDA seems great. The lack of meaningful EBITDA growth over the past couple of years is a bit of a deterrent but some of that seems to be tied to (hopefully) non-recurring events. I'm much less optimistic than you about Brazil and already have as much as I want there via CAAP - on the other hand Fraport's Lima airport is a great asset.,

"I believe PRU at a 4% yield price is a buy- which is why I added 200 shares recently at 89.56. Remember, the last dividend bump was about 20%- as I recall. I will add more if this yield price holds or becomes more favorable toward year end.",
"I am long PRU but do have some concerns about the dividend. A couple of years ago they went five quarters before they raised the dividend . Last year they raised the dividend an out sized 20%. December 1, in a couple of weeks, a complete new management team takes over. Yes I love higher dividends but from an insurance company you look for stable predictable changes year in year out. I doubt very much that the dividend increase, in Q1, will be as large as last years. I could make a case why PRU is not a good investment: Here you have a company that raised its dividend 20% and bought back 4% of their shares and yet the stock price is essentially flat over the last year.",

Good article. Nobody wants to mention the VAT tax that Europe and China also charge. Why should the U.A. pay for Europe and China's huge government expenses?,
The tariffs will not help the US automakers. The strategy is to force the transfer of more production by foreign companies to their US factories. F and GM won't pick up any market share.And the risk of retaliatory tariffs is also present.,
"Mary Barra and Ford executives have given the White House their input. Mr Trump had Barra on his staff team a few months ago (remember). What ever directions Trump decide to go in, will benefit  GM and Ford, it just make sense. U.S. is where GM and Ford make 80% of their profits. By raising prices on imported autos, this will give GM and Ford an opportunity to beat out foreign companies on prices and increase their U.S. sales. If GM/Ford pick up an extra 5% of sales because of pricing, this will give their North American earning a big boost. What Trump should say is, ( I think the EU have a very good model, the 10% they charge the whole outside world on autos coming into Europe is so good , we the U.S. is going to adopt to it.) This will still put U.S. tariff tax lower than Japan, China, Korea, and many many more nations around the globe. So I really believe GM and Ford will gain from the U.S. treating the rest of the world the same as they treat us.",
"This is the best article I've seen on the effects of tariffs on European auto imports because it  contains an opinion based on some figures.  So thanks for that Seeking Profits.It would be interesting to see how counter tariffs by the EU would impact Ford.  I'm not an expert on the auto industry, but looking at North American parts content percentages on new car stickers gives me a feeling that it would not be as bad as US tariffs will be for the Europeans, because Ford makes most of the content they sell in the EU in the EU, whereas European brands have much less North American content in their imports to the US.  Also, what they assemble in the US has a high EU content.  I don't think Audi and Porsche assemble any vehicles in the US.  Maybe Audi assembles some vehicles in Mexico.I would love to hear somebody who is knowledgeable of the North American auto industry comment on this article.",

The problem with consignments is that unless you move inventory, the supplier will not replenish your stock and you end up in a discounting world, where your margins are likely impacted.

I have not visited the BZUN platform but do the retail customers log on to BZUN or to a UI/UX featuring the brand that is being sold?  What is the moat here?I would appreciate some insights into why this services model is better?  What are the signs that it results in more cash and earnings?

"Thanks for the post. My two cents are, looks like the only justifications to the slowing down in GMV on this year’s Singles day are 1) the saturation and 2) the services that are excluded in the GMV. 1) can be evaluated by comparing the Alibaba’s Single day growth with its Q3 YOY growth to tell the saturation is only for the Singles day or for the entire e-commerce market in China. For 2) I really doubt how significant it is in the revenue. Maybe we can find some statistics in previous earnings which I haven’t looked into yet.",

Great post,
The 6 mth chart has a discouraging trend of lower highs and lower lows indicating there are more sellers than buyers. Doubt the majority are uninformed. Perhaps it is the general malaise regarding Chinese companies. Is BZUN another company that should not be affected by tariffs but is?,
Stick to writing not when to enter or exit trades. Have humility you pleb.,
The business transition should not have had any effect on GMV settled (growth) unless they don’t count GMV from services. I wish Baozun set expectations correctly as they had 69% GMV growth reported in Q2 2018 despite the same model. What changed from q2 18 to 11.11 for the GMV to fall from 68 to 31%?,
Could you explain why the GMV would fall when transitioning the business model? I don't fully understand because I thought that the GMV was a consistent way of measuring the amount of goods sold regardless of whether BZUN owns the product or not. Thanks and long BZUN!,

SLL also says it can reduce Lithum brine extraction time from months to hours, but I wonder if MGX tech is superior.  If a deal could be made, this would allow MGX to start generating revenue a lot quicker.  Standard Lithium is planning to ""piggyback"" their brine filtration onto three existing Bromine extraction plants in S. Arkansas owned by Great Lakes Chemical Corporation, a division of LANXESS.  (or maybe LAXNESS).  The bromine operation has been in business for decades so there are no problems doing geology, drilling wells, and getting government permits.  Plus, unlike the Lithium mines in Chile, there is lots of infrastructure already in place.  I realize that MGX would want to protect its IP but there must be a way.

"Just thought I would post the news from the JPEP take over and how the CC blessed the transaction.""The merger terms were negotiated, reviewed, and approved by the Boards of Directors of both American Midstream and JP Energy and the Conflicts Committee of American Midstream, which is composed entirely of independent directors. Both Boards of Directors and the Conflicts Committee have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. As part of their evaluation process, the Conflicts Committee retained independent legal and financial advisors and received a fairness opinion from its financial advisor.""www.arclight.com/...So when you see the CC doing nothing it means they are not blessing or rejecting the offer since they are mute on the whole thing. To me it is questionable if they are doing anything.",
It seems like SXC has done the same to SXCP.,
"I feel like I am a used car lot, and Arclight is the salesman. First I am told there is a vehicle for sale for 2k. While I am contemplating this purchase, suddenly I am told the car is off the market as someone else is willing to pay 3k for the vehicle. Then as I am about to drive away from the lot, Arclight comes rushing back to tell me they can sell me the vehicle now for 2k and I happily accept now that my expectations have been managed that 2k is a good deal. Is Arclight suddenly going to come back at $6.10 and we will all rush to say great and move on from this, when the company is more likely worth closer to $10?",
"I just couldn't help myself. I bought back into AMID today with a $4 handle. I'll just say in advance, when AL inevitably pulls the $6.10 offer and this thing dumps even lower, there will be no tears. I know perfectly well I'm playing with fire.",
"Whew, more than a buck below the offering price.  What's the market saying, that this offer is going to be withdrawn?  That's a stunning gap.  Is there any way to play this?  July $5 calls can be had for 65 cents, but I don't see a lot of value in that bet, if the offer is cancelled or rejected the price could drop below $4.  Puts are about the same price, so maybe you could play it both ways?  If the offer is accepted you'll make 45 cents, leaving you down about 20 cents.  If it's rejected or withdrawn, the price might drop to $4, with roughly the same results.  Seems as though the options market has this figured out (by accident of transaction of course).   So, I see no way to play this, AMID is kryptonite.",
"Archlight knew those terminals were getting sold, come guys, they are smarter than that. Their $6.10 offer was all planned. They didn't want those terminals anyway. Like I said the $6.1 offer can be justified now that the terminals have been sold.",
"LOL, the next stab wound we will receive from AL is when the announce they are removing their $6.10 bid for the company. After the stock drops to $4, then they will bid $4.05.",
Take the buyout offer. Done with it. Can ArcLight cancel the offer without penalty?,
"The buyout offer was made when crude was trading around $72, has the recent 30% drop in crude price materially damaged the prospects of the company to the point where even the $6.10 offer might be revised lower? The stock is flirting with all time lows now, at this point even getting back above $6 seems like a monumental task.",
@Long Player Some of the things you say and write just amaze me. I still remember when you loved FGP. It wasn't too long ago you loved AMID. Then you shifted to defending ArcLight because the company needed to invest in growth. Now you have finally come full circle in being pissed off at Arclight...although literally the very last person out there to do so. You also have a suspicion that SXE is becoming more valuable by the day? LOL....,
"The real question should be, can archlight buy on the open market even with a non-binding offer on the table? if so, who do you think is buying the heavy volumes? just look at some of the volume trades. Now think about AMID selling the terminals in relation to the $6.10 offer. The offer will now be justified since selling those terminals, you just watch. So I will be adding at $5.50 and below because the $6.10 offer will be accepted. my average is $8.75, so I am pissed as well but be smart on this people, you know the offer will be accepted. Yes they engineered the quarter to reflect poorly, so people would sell and archlight can scoop up.",
"Arclight obviously has a better bead on the value of AMID assets than almost anyone else, as they have been managing AMID. As such, of course their bid isn't generous in the slightest. And, it seems highly improbably to me that AMID will turn down the offer. However, I want to try and learn more from this than just stay away from Arclight. The real questions to me are:How did AMID appear to be so profitable only a few quarters ago and yet now appears to be such a looser?How did all the ""experts"" out there not see the true story?Lastly, did Arclight and/or Arclight executives buy shares of AMID, and if so when and at what price? I realize that the oil/NG industry is a tough one, and executives make honest mistakes all the time. Maybe we retail investors just got stuck in the fallout of some honest mistakes. But, the answer to the last question especially may tell us if this is the case or not. If Arclight and or it's executives are taking the same bath that we are, then it's probably not devious. If they're not, then yes, let's find a lawyer. Anyone?",
OK...so you're whining about being run over and left for dead by ArcLight.  Where are the ambulance chasers one normally finds feasting on such carrion?,
Why is this stock trading 10% below the lowball buyout offer?,
"Gp has a duty to limiteds to treat us with good faith and fair dealing, Please donrt diminish this duty to say no duty due us simply because the general partner has fiduciary conflicts. This transaction reeks of conflicts and lack of fairness and good faith, limited partners unite dont let em get away with it, dont call class action lawyer call a congressman.",
it's in the hands of the largest unaffiliated shareholders and independent directors. Historically that doesn't seem to bode well for retail investors who want to stay invested rather than be forced out at the bottom. Please assess this offer from Arclight based on potential long run realizable value rather than curent depressed market metrics.,
Amid was my hope after being devastated in the Oil crash...im out at around 6 average...killed me to sell...ill buy back in if I have a chance for some good gains.....,
"More likely the conflicts committee just negotiates for a little more, that's the way the equally grotesque takeout by ENB went of its US subsidiaries.  As for the vote, these things always pass, it seems institutions automatically vote yes.  ETP's vote was like 99% or something.  I'm sure there were more than 1% of the unit holders that didn't enjoy getting a second straight 30% distribution haircut, but those votes were drops in the ocean.",
As an LP I don't think we can do much about what GP will do with the partnership. Going forward just avoid anything associated with Arclight. Lesson learned.,
"I sold MMLP recently when I discovered Arclight in its structure-- which, in my opinion, is like discovering termites in your house. Now I check the Arclight website often to see if there's anything new I should be avoiding and will be diligent about avoiding any enterprise that may be associated with that company or its senior management for the rest of my investing career. I will remember. But as @darnoc111 says, new buyers will eventually come along who'll have no idea what kind of company they're dealing with.",
Yes nothing is beyond these bad actors.,
I wouldn't be surprised if Arclight withdrew their non-bonding offer and picked up the pieces in BK or offered less after cratering the price.,
"Long Player I agree with your sentiments. But going by the current track record I doubt that Arclight or management will do anything to reverse the losses of unitholders. Why should they? After they take this company under they only have to wait a few years and repeat the same thing. Few investors will remember and greed will help sell the next set of sucker's, making Arclight a lot more money. It's too bad that the GP bylaws have been made in favor of them and at least for now preventing a lawsuit against them. The right thing for Arclight to do would be to fix this mess, but so far they haven't tried to do the right thing. Good luck to unitholders.",
"All of us independent small, medium, and large investors should revolt and vote against no on all Arclight proposals to steal AMID. Arclight shot AMID in both upper legs. AMID along with Arclight are purposely looking at the SUN with dark sunglasses burning their sponge brains. A class action lawsuit could be put into action via a large investor/group. Rise-UP and push our revolt stance to other investment websites and blogs. Vote out management. Look at how small investors revolted against Rite Aid's [rad] failed merger with Walgreens, resulting in RAD 1000+ store buy. And aborted merger with Albertsons grocery conglomerated who was trying to steal RAD at a fire sale price. Plus failed merger with Fredericks Drug store chain. Kick Arclight back into its torch tank so we can light their GAS from their collective ASSeses.",
Management should have taken questions on the CC about the business no matter what. just because the special committee is reviewing a buyout bid does not omit Management's responsibility to address all of the other facets of the business.,
"What are the odds that management will listen to your advice? Another way to frame this question is, did Arclight management do this intentionally, or what is just an unfortunate series of circumstances?  If it was intentional - which would be extremely devious and IMHO Enron level fraud - then the buyout will likely be agreed upon and limited partner shareholders are, shall we say, stuff out of luck. If it was just circumstance, then perhaps there's a reasonable chance that your suggestions will be carried out. Odds???",
Great note. Thank you for being another voice against these thieves.,
AMID was soaring like an eagle until Arclight started dumping or should I say dropping down worthless crap that ruined AMID and now they are attempting to injure as many true investors as possible to pick up good assets on the remarkable cheap.,
I concluded that lack of q&a at cc meant the takeout was a done deal. Arclight seem to be stealing the co at our expense.,

That’s yet too early to estimate for an outsider.

why Jaguar is not coming to US market which has more EV sales potential?  I want to see such comparison in US market.,
"I am curious about this 'Tesla killer"" competition every Tesla short is all revved up about.According to Tesla president - Jerome Guillen - “The Gigafactory is critical to Tesla. There is more batteries produced here for electric vehicles than in the rest of the planet combined....” So riddle me this - if Tesla produces more EV batteries than rest of the world combined, and can only produce only 300k vehicles per year with those batteries  (currently), AND there are other existing electric car manufacturers in US and China eating up most of the remaining supply,....... where will the batteries for all those Tesla Killers come from?  And don't tell me more is coming online - it takes YEARS to rev up production and if anyone - TESLA, again, will be leading the charge, and already plans to do so with gigafactory in China and Europe - so the status quo will most likely remain.  Others will have to fight for the remaining inventory.",
"Once again stretching to find something significant where there really isn't all that much.We are a few months away from seeing Model 3 on sale in these countries. The Jag is 'new kid on the block' this five minutes. And, the absolute numbers of cars involved here is trivial. Tesla is making more Model 3 cars every single day that the total sales of either Jag or Tesla in these countries over the entire month of October. And the difference in sales between Jag and Tesla over an entire month in these countries? Just 76 cars.What we see here is a lot of analysis poured into a very small, cherry picked sample of Tesla's and Jag's market space. If these European countries represent an important and significant market, and the difference in October sales between the companies favors Jag by 76 cars, Shouldn't we also, perhaps look at the US market? In the US, Model 3 is the fourth fastest selling car. If Jags sales are on that list, it's probably not on the first page... Oh, and for October the difference between Tesla's US sales and Jag's US iPace sales is a whole lot bigger than 76 cars. (I'm guessing here, but my guesses are usually pretty good.)",
"I must admit I still haven't seen any iPaces in UK and there appear to be significant delivery lead times. The iPace is a good car but smaller than either the Model X or S. One interesting factor is that the FPace is Jaguar's biggest selling car, their saloon car sales are going south. The demand, certainly in Europe, appears to be for MPVs or mini-SUVs.

Jaguar is a UK Company right?How are their UK sales going?:) Love to know,

Martha Stewart went to jail for way less than the crap Elon Musk has pulled.,
Comparing Jaguar to Tesla? Then add Tesla X and S numbers. Tesla is beating Jaguar everywhere except for Norway and overall it is a draw.,
"Tesla blind fanbois just do not get it. If only ONE competitor causes this much decline in Tesla sales in their much more profitable X and S models, how about 10 more by the end of 2019? 30 more a year later? Many of those cars will be priced below $35K. Tesla cannot compete with that currently.Tesla has only three outdated sedan models. The sedan markets in the US are shrinking, from 2.5M per year in 2015 to estimated 1.8M this year. Model Y is at least one year away, more likely two. Too late for Tesla!",
Are the DOJ and SEC done with Tesla yet?,
interior of a tesla model 3 looks like a 2×4 board with a cheapy ipad glued on the center.  Jag Ipace looks way way way way better.,
check out the range on the model 3 in cold weather. will it have the range it claims? Doubtful.,
"Tesla will do poorly in EU and china. Local car markers will provide better and cheaper options to their customers. At the high end; Jag, Porshe, BMW, Audi will take sales away from Tesla. In the lower end; VW, Renault will destroy tesla. Only a fool will think that EU governments will let their national champions disappear.",
LOL... really... STILL don't understand deliveries vs sales?  Sad!,

"Looks amazing, but its still behind.insideevs.com/...",
I'll come back to this article in April 2019.,
good ole Anton can always depend on a desperate short for a good giggle,
Just curious - what are the top 3 selling autos in Norway during the same time period and how many have been sold?,
Model 3 already setting up display models in Europe. A model 3 mid range has more range than the Ipace and cost more than 20k dollars less. Let’s see what happens when the model 3 reaches Europe in Q1 2019 :),
"Let’s look at some reasons why anyone would want to buy an electric vehicle to begin with.Saves the planet:No because 80% of electricity generated still comes from fossil fuels.Add on the upcoming landfills of old batteries!Saves money on gas:If you want to save money on gas you wouldn’t be spending 70,000+ on a car...If you are spending 70,000+ you probably don’t care about gas savings anyway..Still have to pay for the electrical bill.Convenience: nothing convenient about waiting an hour for your car to charge vs the 5 minutes to fuel on gas.Nothing convenient with anything to do with Tesla service.Looks great: preference Self driving: not really.So whos buying a EV?Trend followers, those who want what’s new and in, and ignorant people who know nothing about climate change, our infrastructure and energy consumption.I’ll be buying another Jeep in 5 years. Don’t have to worry about “pot holes”Fun fact: earth has had 5 ice ages in which we are currently coming out of one now.What’s interesting is the earth has spent majority of its life through ice ages at temperatures 3-4 times the average we live in currently.EV’s to me are no where near where they need to be. Our infrastructure is further behind and it’s literally an entire market ploy for the new thing that’s in.",
"Apples to Oranges. Since this is about arguing valuation and profitability and return on investments, lets stratify the data to that point. I-Pace produced $54M in revenue assuming an $80k ASP (being conservative and placing this at what is probably very upper-end of ASP and in USD) in this period. Model X produced $21.9M in revenue, markedly lower, and only assuming a $100k ASP, being very liberal here and assuming the bottom-end configuration dominates (opposite the assumption for I-Pace.) The Model S, assuming a $90K ASP produced $34.6M in revenues, combined with X totaling $56.5M in revenue, beating Jaguar. Tesla EVs are still outselling (revenue) Jaguar EVs in the European market, using ASPs engineered to help the Jaguar numbers... And I didn't even get into margins for producing each vehicle yet, where Tesla will pull an even further lead.",
"I hope Tata Motors does very well with their jag-sitar. I would love to buy a $10,000 Zenon Yodha pickup truck some day.",
This author always writes with flawed logic and ignorance.,
Perhaps Jaguar would have sold hundred time more if they were not supply-constrained :{Hey!   That worked for Felon...,
"Maybe there were a lot of company registrations for press fleet and for dealer demonstrators at launch.I think that the IPace is great and also Tesla is great. Tesla supporters ignore data and Tesla detractors use data without integrity. But because I am not long nor short in Tesla, but I am long on the planet, I welcome the EV development.",
"Q3 deliveries totaled 83,500 vehicles: 55,840 Model 3, 14,470 Model S, and 13,190 Model X.Again Anton is trying to make the Model S and X European sales as relevant to the future of Tesla.   Clearly the last quarter demonstrated that the Model 3 is the future of Tesla.   The author is trying to build a bear case out of this misuse of statistics..the Jaguar IPace is selling less than a thousand cars in his selected countries and Tesla sold 17,000 Model 3 in the USA in October...according to InsideEVs..  and European Model 3 sales start in Q1 2019.",
"We are slowly approaching a tipping point where - like with iPhones - it is the 'cool' thing to own a Tesla.  That will make it even more in demand, and if there is a waiting line - even more 'I must have it' item.Jaguar - of course is a 'cool' brand too - if you are 70 or older- so it should come with full autonomy navigation to really appeal to it's target audience.Bottom line:  Jaguar and even more so VW entering the market simply confirms to the masses that electric cars are here to stay and ARE the future.  And TESLA is an undeniable leader in that space.I do not see excessive inventory issues for TESLA for a long time to come, and as long as they can sell every car they make as soon as they make it - they are only in competition with their own limitations.Personally - I'm waiting for the Tesla Pickup Truck to replace my aging F250 diesel.  I know I will have to wait several years - but what is the point of buying 100+ year technology for 60-80k now, if I can buy something truly desirable in few years? And I'm sure I'm not alone.",
"Is October jaguars first month in Europe?  because that looks like some tiny first month numbers. look at the YTD sales in Europe,  there are a bundle that are doing better than jaguar. if ipace can't ramp up before Dec, to some actual significant numbers,  model 3 will take majority sales. also why even compare Sweden??  29 vs 54, both are minuscule,  WOW 25 HIGHER...",
Keep calm.  Don’t short until Q1’ 19.  Elon will use extreme financial engineering to pump this baby up till year end.,
Those numbers are tiny almost rounding errors.,
"So the big miss of this article is whether or not S and X sales have declined relatively to previous month and then YOY.If the S and X sales YOY are similar then iPace is stealing sales form ICE, maybe form it's own loyal customers.Again a micro picture from Anton in an attempt to show competition is hurting Tesla...",

"Tesla longs shouldn’t be so butt-hurt. This is great for both companies. Another clear sign the market wants SEXY electric vehicles. Personally, I would take an I-Pace over all other Tesla models because, well, it’s sexier and I like to go off the beaten path.",
"All the Tesla bulls on Seeking Alpha point to the Model 3 as the car that is sweeping the market here and will sweep the market across the globe.i agree that the Model 3 must be a great car to drive and  sales in the US to date have been phenomenal. But I believe its price will put cap sales here and abroad. The market for sedans selling above $45,000 is just not massive. Like most products, the market for cars is a pyramid, and the market shrinks as the price rises. Sales for the Model 3 have been soaring as affluent, early-adopters have rushed to buy after waiting for two years or more for the Model 3 to arrive. Once this backlog of EV enthusiasts is sated, sales are likely to level off. Sales in Europe will also start off strong to affluent early-adopters, but that market may taper off even faster due to competition from the I-pace and others.",

You guys need to read my post from early today. It gives you detail of where GM is at and going forward.,
"Here's something about vehicle financing that is GM-related, but probably more relevant to the auto industry as a whole.Yesterday, I had the TV on, and there was an ad for a GM product, the Traverse.What caught my atttention was the promo at the bottom:  0% financing for six years.I presume that is a balloon payment at the end of year 6 of the total purchase price.  That's a lot like a very-underwater mortgage--the car is only worth a small fraction of its original price at that point.  I'd SWAG it at say, 40%.When GM went under, and Ford and Chrysler were in dire straits 10 years ago, one of their many problems was that their finance arm had gotten to leveraged.  Deals like this helped them get there.  Now, maybe it's just a little end of year inventory flogging and nothing to worry about, but over-aggressive lending is a potential problem for any entitiy that does it, from GM to GE to the US government mortgage GSEs.  Any comments?",
GM is basically focusing on the profitability of its truck and SUV segment which is strong in order to fund its electric / autonomous future. Its incredible that Tesla gets such a high multiple when its really companies like GM that will most likely determine the future of mobility.,
Why does GM return $ to shareholders if it believes/knows Cruise is so valuable and that it needs funding so bad? Why are they selling off chunks of its future revenue/profit?How much of that R&D is ICEcar based? (Aka wasted) Where do you discuss GM building high quality products people desire? That’s not a GM strength. GM seems to be withdrawing from the world and only paying lip service to the idea of real investment in the future. Why share Cruise? I don’t think GM know how to foster their program.,

The future is bright for GM because of the entire lineup of autos they have launch across the GLOBE over the last two years.

Raise your dividend HFC!!!!,
Thanks for the article. Would like to hear about views on MPC and VLO compared to PSX and HFC. I have no positions in oil refining stocks but looking to start investing in 1-2 stocks.,
HFC's special dividend has not been paid in a while.  They have been going the buyback route in more recent years.,
I've owned PSX since the spinoff and really haven't looked at HFC.  Does anybody care to chime in and give some input as to PSX or HFC?,
They should be giving more cash back to shareholders with a dividend increase.  HFC had a great quarter but DK blew them away on the EPS beat AND increased their dividend!,

You couldn't claim that there was no effect on the basis of those medians being equal.The median reveals nothing about the variability of the population and cannot be used to determine statistical signifcance. It's simply a ""road marker"" dividing the numbers in half.THEREFORE, when OMER reports:""For the nine evaluable patients, median reductions in proteinuria following the initial 12-week course of treatment were 18.4 percent and 18.0 percent for the OMS721 and placebo groups, respectively.""....that means the ""outliers"" have been IGNORED.  You CAN'T turn around and argue that the results were ""bad"" because of the effect of ""outliers"" when median data in fact IGNORES the outliers.Indeed, the fact that OMER chose median indicates that if they HAD chosen mean and standard deviation, the data likely would have looked much WORSE!

"@mo_strategist  Your link did not work either.Here is the article.Citadel-Led Creditor Group Agrees to Windstream Debt SwapKatia Porzecanski, Dan Wilchins and Allison McNeelyJuly 26, 2018, 1:03 PM PDT•  Group is said to agree to exchange at least $300m of notes•  Pending exchange could impact outcome of ongoing default trialLISTEN TO ARTICLEA group of Windstream Holdings Inc. creditors have agreed to exchange $300 million of the company’s bonds for new debt, a step that may help the rural phone company fend off a default claim and tame its $6 billion debt load.The money managers are led by Citadel and own around 60 percent of Windstream’s 7.75 percent notes due in 2020, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The investors, who also include Elliott Management, Western Asset Management Co., and Loomis Sayles, agreed to exchange their bonds for 10.5 percent second-lien notes that mature in 2024, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.The noteholders, advised by Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, are in discussions with other investors that could expand their holdings to 80 percent of the debt, the people said. While that would still fall short of the 90 percent threshold the company set in its exchange offer, Windstream could continue to extend the offer or lower the threshold. The offer expires at the end of the day Thursday.Representatives for the firms and Windstream declined to comment.Reducing DebtWindstream has said that completing the debt exchange -- which is also open to longer- dated debt due between 2021 and 2024 -- will help it ease its debt burden. That would allow management to focus more on efforts to turn around the business, according to Lindsay Gibbons, a senior analyst at CreditSights.A successful exchange may bolster Windstream’s position in an ongoing legal battle with a separate bondholder, hedge fund Aurelius Capital Management. The fund alleges Windstream defaulted on bonds due in 2023 when it spun-off Uniti Group Inc. in 2015. The parties are in the middle of a trial that could force Windstream to file for bankruptcy if the company loses.Aurelius owns and has been buying Windstream’s notes, as well as credit-default swaps that would pay off if the company defaults, according to testimony at the trial from an adviser to the company. If the judge sides with Aurelius and its trustee U.S. Bank N.A., the decision could trigger cross-defaults on an estimated $5.7 billion in debt, and Windstream doesn’t have the cash to repay. A representative for Aurelius declined to comment.But the company’s improved financial health after the exchange could weigh on Judge Jesse Furman’s ruling in the case, Gibbons said. The trial is adjourned until July 31.“A successful exchange would be another example of support from bondholders, which has been raised in the trial,” said Gibbons, who covers the TMT sector. “We don’t know whether that will resonate with the judge, but it shows how investors believe in the company and want to remain invested. That contradicts Aurelius’ desire to push the company into default.”Complicating Appeal?If Windstream loses the trial and files for bankruptcy, creditors who accepted the new bonds would be in a better spot than they would be if they held onto unsecured debt. Assuming Aurelius doesn’t participate, its unsecured securities would only be repaid after secured debt, which, once the exchange is completed, will include holders of much as $1.5 billion of new second-lien bonds.But if Aurelius were to lose the trial and decide to appeal, the exchange could make an appeal process more complicated because there would be two debt swaps that would ultimately have to be unwound, CreditSights’ Gibbons said. Windstream completed a debt exchange in November 2017 that has become a focus in its default trial.“It comes down to a question of how much this impacts the judge’s ruling,” she said. “Perhaps it does, or perhaps he focuses solely on the letter of the contract and the form of the indenture, but ultimately a successful exchange improves the overall environment for Windstream.”— With assistance by Tiffany Kary",
"@liometopum That link is ""bad"". . .here's a live one:  www.bloomberg.com/...Anyway, the article is from July, and I think its a little speculative (as it has to be).  For this to apply:A. Aurelius would have to decide it wants to appeal (it probably would). B. Appeals court would have to agree to hear the appeal.  I think that's always the single biggest hurdle, and in this case, my guess is it probably wouldn't and this would then end there. C. Appeals court would then have to hear arguments in the appeal. . .that could take months to finish.D. Appeals court would then have to make its decision. . .expect many more months. E. Then *if* (and only if) the appeals court found some sort of reversible error would the issue of trying to reverse a bond swap even come up.   Trying to decide what an appeals court might do here is pretty unrealistic, since we don't even know what the final decision says, or what theoretical points may be appealed. . .but I don't think an appeals court would try to unwind any bond swaps by itself.   IMO, speculating about an appeal is mostly pointless now.  At the very least we still need to see the actual decision first.",
I wonder if who ever loses will appeal the decision like the DOJ and AT&T case. I hope not!,
"What do you guys think of the possibility that as soon as the judge issues a ruling, if positive for win, that win sells its remaining fiber assets to UNit. Win has been talking about selling and unit has mentioned likely closing a large deal by the end of year. Are they possibly talking about each other? It would raise the dependency of unit on win but would also go a long ways to solving Win’s problems.  Thoughts???",
"You can have your cake & eat it too regarding the dividend. Like many companies, $UNIT has an excruciatingly long lead time between the declare date, October 31 and the Ex date of December 28. When the markets take another dump, a common occurrence recently, you can “buy the dividend” cheap, and sell on the Ex date or a little later -and possibly collect a small capital gain. So right now you have a full 7 weeks to do this. Just a 💭 thought.",
Any idea what is the expected timeline for making a decision on the Census question? Seems like we won't get a decision on WIN until that case is resolved.,
"All I know is, if Judge Furman was employed by me, he would no longer have a job based on his productivity or lack thereof.  There is absolutely no reason it should take this long to make a decision. How can someone remember all the facts about a case months later? Know wonder our judicial system is a joke!!",
"We will know the outcome of Judge Furman's decision one trading day before it's actual release (as we always do, in hindsight, on company news). On that one trading day before the release, we will either see an unexplained increase or decrease in both companies share price.",
"To correct the portrayal of Furman’s case on the census, it’s not about whether non-citizens answer the Census correctly or honestly. Rather, what’s at issue is if the question itself discourages non-citizens from responding to the Census. This would impact apportionment of House districts as there would be undercounting of persons. The 14th Amendment specifies that House districts should be apportioned according to total number of persons, not citizens, even though only citizens may vote for Representatives. A question that discourages non-citizens from identifying their existence would skew House district boundaries (and therefore electoral power) to those areas with fewer non-citizens.",
"I'm super long UNIT shares, bond, and options but wish I didn't have so many options expiring Friday having expected the ruling would be in by now. Can't complain as it's been a money maker.I have a position in WIN as well and it's the stock that could soar after the decision.  Even while the legal overhang was still present, it used to trade far higher but the reverse split and continuing overhang has been very tough on it",
"Regarding WIN, yes, I agree this is a trading opportunity.  I just bought back in, today, after a small swing trade. With the Aurelius overhang, the price is just not going to go up much, reducing the fear of a runaway price climb while you are out of the stock. But... the scary thing is when will the judge file his decision? When that happens, the price will explode, and I sure don't want to be trying to get 7-10% and then watch it go up 100% in an instant, while I am out. Back to the ""when"". I am thinking now that he is going to wait until he holiday recess to finish up. But will it be Thanksgiving or Christmas? I wish he'd tell me so I could trade fearlessly.",
"the risk with this reasoning is that even with a positive court decision, if the market does not push UNIT's price up, management would most probably cut the dividend. they will say, you know, we did everything, even the court decision was positive, it's the market's fault blah blah.so we will cut. and you know, we will create value long term as we execute on our strategic growth plan, etc etc. what they will conveniently omit is how they have been overpaying for these deals, but make no mistake, the market will punish them for it.and what i start to notice, everyone here on these boards is waiting for the positive court decision, so they can sell into the spike.... who will be the buyer? institutional investors? the hedge funds who will be buying into a possible dividend cut. i am not sure",
Made this investment because of win dividend lost my butt. Live and learn.,
"Maroon, I don't think that Judge Furman is bound by any time constraint. He will publish is finding when he is sure he has made the correct decision.",

"TimAgreed....AGO has a chance to grow its adjusted book value meaningfully towards $100/share with 1) Positive outcome for PR2) Possible further reinsurance deals with AMBAC, FGIC and perhaps MBI, which would be a HUGE deal3) Growth In PVP underwritings if interest rate environment moves higher.4) Continued share buyback of roughly 10% of the float each year....All else being equal, that should raise the adjusted book value of $84ish by roughly $8.50/year.....So, by Dec 31, 2019 (roughly 15 months from now), book value could be $11ish higher based on that math, alone.Yes, I know some will quibble with me that it is not exactly $11 as the company will be lowering its book value by spending the capital to effect the buyback...But, if the company continues to earn roughly $5/share per year, it will simply be using current earnings to buy back shares.But, unfortunately, Mr. Market still does not believe the math or the outlook.As I said, perhaps fears of the impact of municipal defaults in the case of a long anticipated US recession...But, then again, no more huge exposures to structured finance is a very good thing.Happy Thanksgiving",
"TimOne ""black swan"" consideration in the AGO story is the fact that municipal bankruptcies are quite likely to rise significantly in any coming recession.Scores of states/cities have pension plans that are basically insolvent....And just as many cities are struggling already with strained operating budgets.  Perhaps none of these operational shortfalls are as dreadful as PR.  But the pension plights are horrific and afflict many of these same operationally challenged municipalities.I am NOT suggesting that AGO is going to ""fail"" on the back of these...But, future loss reserves may well be in order if, as I believe, 2019 sees overall market mayhem with or without an economic slowdown.So, while the PR situation appears to be resolving itself (slowly, but surely) nicely for most PR creditors (especially the secured ones like most of AGO's exposure), it is quite possible that AGO is going to face more loss provisioning in coming quarters from its ""bread and butter"" municipal exposures....Yes, as muni credit quality deteriorates overall, the market demand for AGO's ""AA"" insurance should rise , and quite significantly...But, balanced against that should be further provisioning that might cloud the company's financial outlook.Yes, AGO seems dramatically undervalued....But, the improving PR situation is well known and yet still, the stock is trading near its lows in relation to unadjusted book value at well less than 50%.Perhaps Mr Market is signifying that greater credit challenges lie ahead beyond the PR horizon.Just a thought.

What is your take on the likelihood of Viking getting a partnership for VK5211? I figured the holdup was getting a response back from the FDA about what the FDA wanted for a phase III trial. Viking now has this information so it seems there should be nothing holding up a potential partnership.Also what is your take on the probability of a buyout? I read that MDGL had buyout interest after they announced phase IIb results. Was there legitimate interest based on your knowledge? If so why would those companies not buyout VKTX which seems to be best in class and is trading at a comparatively much lower valuation?,

by 2030 this segment will be wildly profitable as coal can not be replaced in a decade like posters and author things. Plus what makes renewable............. Coal does.  Its  growing population and GE needed to adjust but do not forget the power segment is still relevant.,
"True demand is down, but I disagree that the severe decline in profitability is not primarily due to mismanagement. The cost synergies publicized at the time of the Alstom Acquisition dudn’t Happen in 2015 or 2016. In fact p, they really weren’t obvious until Flannery announced them in the latter half of .2017 and I believe the restructuring and churn costs are still occurring. Further the former business leader either left or was fired due to the Flannery appointment to be replaced by a finance man who did not grow up in the business. In the face of a demand decline, the factory was allowed to continue to produce gas turbines to “level load’ the factory. It was known at acquisition time that Alstom’s Business was declining, their maintenance contracts held at half the margins of the GE legacy contracts, and that some of their customers were either financially or politically unstable and that much of the European philosophy is to favor more employment over increases in profit, making reduction of staff and facilities more difficultl. By the way the price of Alstom is really 13,1 billion given the options exercised by the Alstom interests to sell the split off joint venture to GE. The whole sequence smacks of a management struggling to control what on its face was an ill founded, ill-timed and very disruptive acquisition of a business with a vastly different culture that the new management had neither the background nor capability with which to make the decisions the environment required, Further the dea that the world will suddenly not require gas turbines is also suspect. Germany, despite it claim of going to renewables and its obsession with global warming agrees to build a natural gas pipeline with Russia to provide it with Russian natural gas, Holland p, despite its long history of useping windmills, still uses fossil fuels to produce about .69% of its electricity and GE power just received ab.200M+order to use its leading edge technology to purify the exhaust gases of coal generating electrical plants in India of sulfuric toxic gas. The market for Gas turbines will continue and so will upgrades to existing facilities well into the future. The issue is can GE’business be managed to properly deal with the market place,",
"Very interesting, helpful article. I thought the expectation was that the coal plants would gradually be retired and replaced with new natgas plants.  I expected this to happen partly because nat gas is so cheap in the US.  Is this not happening?  Or is it happening too slowly to matter when renewables are increasing and overall demand is declining?",
Why don’t they just sell off the segment of the power unit if it’s not going to be profitable. Also unload GE Capital.,
"Surprised that the other side of the coin is not being discussed.True - Everything is moving to being electric.True - All gas engines will be replaced by electric engines (common sense).True - All vehicles (and probably planes) will eventually go electric.However, that means a tremendous demand for electricity - not a decrease. You can make a device more energy efficient but you have a lot more devices on the grid.Consider the following (www.eia.gov/...):63% of all our energy is from Gas and Oil20% is from Nukes17% is from renewables (1.3% solar)The biggest part of renewables is hydropower and wind turbines. So there are a lot of turbines needed now and in the future. It is true that in the next few years you will see a lot more solar roofs (Tesla will really get cranking) and GE should try to get into the game with power packs, etc. but that game is just starting to happen.",

"I think all the author is trying to say is that conventional power generation is getting squeezed by a combination of reduced electrical demand and increased renewable generation. Every new electrical appliance that we buy is more efficient than the old one it replaces, and that logic applies to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers. Solar and wind generation cherry picks the supply chain because of incentives and favorable regulations. This doesn't just impact GE, it impacts everyone in the power generation sector, including utilities with generating assets.",
"Just a little info to the author about some of the non-obvious issues affecting all players in the Turbine business today:With the subsidised Renewables, in-service machines are now offered ""upgrades"" which typically allow an increase in the number of operating hours before (expensive) inspections. In the past, the inspections were the cash cows for (most) Turbine manufacturers - high tech is high maintenance - which allows healthy regular cash flow. By reducing the service intervals, this directly reduces the ability to generate high profit margins regularly. (example, Power Plant owners can upgrade their units to increase service intervals from 4 years to upto 8 years.)The service business provided a nice stable income stream which allowed the new unit fluctuations to be ridden out, now this income stream has become lower as the servicing intervals increase which are exposing suppliers such as GE to higher risk.In Summary, the problems faced by turbine suppliers are not only the market shrinking due to the subsidised renewables market and new competitors diluting the smaller market, but also that the service market is being affected by pressure from the operators to reduce costs in order that these operators themselves can stay  in operation.This is the ""perfect storm"" for all turbine manufacturers.I wonder what plan Larry is gonna be coming up with to solve this little dilema.",

"This was a crap article. Aside from Disney and Fox agreeing to a merger, nothing was factually accurate in this report. Also, Disney can pay for a significant portion of content and expansion into the DTC with its substantial cash flows. Netflix is relying almost entirely on leverage going into a rising rate environment.",
"As others have commented, Disney will not be receiving Sky or National Geographic. Additionally, calling Netflix's streaming services as unprofitable isn't quite accurate. The margins are not nearly as good on international or domestic streaming, but they do exceed the costs and are improving. Additionally, Disney is certainly making a large bid at streaming offering exclusive content for their two biggest franchises (Star Wars and The Marvel Cinematic Universe) that are only available on their platform. These offerings include new  episodes of the notoriously expensive 'The Clone Wars', a live-action Star Wars TV series helmed by the director of Iron Man & Iron Man 2, and live action Marvel shows starring Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, and some have even claimed a Tom Holland starring Spider-Man series. Given these examples, it's clear Disney is not sparing any expense in the name of profitability. They are in a much better place to finance these projects between their large stockpiles of capital and their impressive track record of huge returns they can use to attract investors. Finally, debt financing is often considered cheaper and preferable to equity financing or spending free cash flow (unless large reserves exist), so it's not surprising investors have not taken issue with Netflix engaging in this practice. Overall, I agree with your sentiments on Netflix, but I disagree with the evaluation of Disney as an underdog and Netflix's capital structure.",

Disney is NOT getting 39% of Sky! Comcast NOW owns Sky!,
"How many of these articles are we going to have to slog through. DIS and NFLX will both win. So will AMZN and probably T too. They are or will grow into global streaming behemoths that will divide much of the entertainment audience between them, undermining or destroying distribution methods that will lose audience: cable, broadcast, theatrical movies outside of some genres that do well on the big screen (the Avatar followup movies are going to hit big for example - need big screens to appreciate the visuals) and most physical media (but a connoisseur market will keep Blu-Ray alive at least - collectors like to have objects to own).There are still a lot of interesting questions such as, can Disney take over Hulu entirely or will Comcast be a spoiler? If Comcast is a spoiler, will Disney bail on Hulu entirely and build a Hulu substitute. Can Comcast compete at all or are they locked out at this point? When will CBS admit defeat and sell out to one of the winners (maybe Viacom will be part of the sale by then)? How well or badly will AT&T manage their assets, especially HBO? What's Apple up to - a free, PG-13 service intended mainly to sell more pricey gizmos and not expected to compete toe to toe with Netflix et al? Facebook and YouTube are also ""streaming services,"" just free/ad-based.

"I feel like a lot of people throw around the term ""moat"" without really understanding the concept. Saying that Netflix (and its 5-6 years of produced content) have a content moat over Disney, or any other legacy studio, reflects a fundamental lack of understanding of the concept. In reality, Netflix has been working to eat into the content moat of the legacy media companies since it started producing content. It's goal has always been to eat into that content moat as much as possible before the legacy producers start eating into Netflix's subscriber moat.The concept that you put forward, where Netflix has the advantage that its shareholders don't care if it isn't profitable, is a pretty weird one. I'm not sure you have really thought it through. Maybe the way to try to explain my issue with it is to go 5 years into the future. Remember, content businesses can't sit on their merits. They need to keep producing content. All of the content produced today becomes library content as soon as its initial burst runs out (I would say it runs out in less than a year, for sure). So, Netflix produces a bunch of content today, which is great for them. But, Disney still produces more content today...it is simply spread across their various platforms (theatrical, various TV networks, etc). Five years from now all that content will be available to the streaming service, as library content. Meaning that, from the future perspective, Disney will have more library content from 2018 than Netflix will, even though Netflix is spending more on its streaming service's original content, at present. From that perspective, Disney's library moat is just continuing to increase, not decrease.Now, staying at 5 years in the future, Disney still has a huge library advantage, the question for consumers will be on new original content. A popular new original show is worth way more than library content...at least, for a certain period of time. At that point in time, Netflix still has to compete with Disney on new original content. Maybe Netflix will be profitable by then, but, even then, it will still have the weight of a pile of debt on top of it, for a long time. Disney will have positive cash flow coming in from it's variety of businesses for the next 5 years. I don't think there is any reasonable scenario where Netflix will make more positive cashflow in the next 5 years than Disney, meaning that Disney will still have the advantage, in terms of financial resources to produce content, over Netflix in 5 years. This is in addition to having way more actual production assets (studio facilities, employees, talent deals, IP, etc) to use to produce that content.If you combine the various factors I talked about above, along with Disney's advantage in well-known brands (which won't disappear anytime soon), you can probably see why Disney doesn't feel the need to rush the launch of its streaming service. In 5 years, if Disney has a much larger library, way more powerful established brands, and more financial resources to produce original content for its streaming service than Netflix does, who has the advantage? If your answer isn't Disney, I would love to hear the counterargument.",
"You dropped in the article that Disney+ will be the sole outlet for new movies. If true, what does that do to HBO and other premium channels that show recent movies?",
Disney does not have to win ... just execute.Can see scenario where house holds have both NFLX and mixture of the Disney streaming services.,
"I stopped reading after the ignorance on the well-documented fact that Disney must divest the RSN's. No excuse for not mentioning that. Second, Disney launching three services is inefficient when it should launch one with three tiers/bundles. That way one app/service can house their entire service. Most importantly, they will test whether Netflix has the content to survive on its own, given that they're pulling everything off.",
"As long as both prices of Disney and Netflix will be lower and payable people could decide to take both. I have Netflix my own but I don’t like it. How many series do they have? And how many with more than 1 season and in the same time where a season has more than 6 episodes, not much. If there is a serie I like it is over after 6 hours watching and we have to wait a year to continue. That’s why I am mostly watching movies if I have time and start my serie-addiction when I have my own home and netflix has decent content. But I still won’t choose between, choose for both",
Disney will not own Fox network or Fox sports after merger.,
"Good article, but it's important to recognize that it's not DIS ""vs"" NFLX as much as it's about DIS joining NFLX in the streaming space. While most NFLX subscribers will look at what DIS has to offer, and many will add Disney+ to their subscriptions, very few will stop being NFLX subscribers as a result of these new offerings. On the contrary, Disney+ will help accelerate cord cutting as the more desirable content there is on the streaming side, the less reason there is to keep that hefty monthly Cable TV bill in the household budget. And of course, once the decision is made to cut the cord, there's even more reason to push that Netflix button that's on your TV remote as well, so ironically a successful Disney+ will help drive new NFLX subscribers as well.From a DIS strategy standpoint, the balancing act they're looking at is how do they manage their transition from linear TV to streaming across all of their properties? Watch for weasel words like ""complementary"", which is a red flag that their heart is still wedded to Cable TV. That's been HBO's problem, which is why HBO Now has been a failure as a streaming entrant.As long as Hulu continues to be ""management by committee"", with their primary business being recycling Cable titles, don't expect much from it. DIS would be wise to jettison it if they can't take full control of it.",

AMAZON is the number one, of course. Amazon has a very lo profit margin and its valuation is 140 times its cash flow...considering Amazong Numbers ODP Stocks should be near 100$.

The results were presented at the Neuro-Oncology Annual Meeting in New Orleans.• Ad-RTS-hIL-12 combined with a 20 mg dose of veledimex and less than 20 mg of dexamethasone is the optimal regimen. Higher doses of steroids appear to suppress the immune response and adversely affect survival compared to low-dose steroids. A sub-analysis of the data showed median overall survival of 17.8 months in six patients receiving 20 mg or less of dexamethasone compared to a median of 6.4 months in nine patients receiving more than 20 mg.• A Phase 1 study evaluating Controlled IL-12 + Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab) is now enrolling the second dosing cohort.• A Phase 2 trial assessing Controlled IL-12 + Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:REGN) PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) should commence in H1 2019.• The company says it is looking for a development partner to advance Controlled IL-12 through registration studies.,

"I don't think you are correct about the description of curtailment.

If the servicer doesn't put the loan to HUD before the UPB is 100%, then they get curtailed on the amount that they receive from HUD and must make up the difference to GNMA.  Nowhere is a servicer responsible for buying back loans -- they are just the servicer (assuming they didn't originate the loans and there's no breach in the origination).

Good article and on point. Scott’s has a history of writing down acquisitions that don’t pay out after the so call synergies are really nothing but smoke and minors.

"FYI as posted on other SA threads...Looks like MSFT is going to finally have a Surface laptop with an AMD processor...venturebeat.com/...======================================================Microsoft watcher Brad Sams has released a book chronicling the company’s Surface brand: Beneath a Surface. While you’ll want to read all 26 chapters to get the juicy details, the last one includes Microsoft’s hardware roadmap for 2019, and even a part of 2020 — spanning various Surface products and even a little Xbox.Roadmaps change. Deadlines get pushed back. Products are killed. Almost all these devices are a year or more from release, so nothing here is set in stone — as Sams told me, “This is a roadmap, not a perfect launch schedule.” That said, we’ve heard some of this from other sources, and Sams has gotten plenty of scoops throughout his career, so these tidbits are worth poring over.Here’s a quick rundown of Microsoft’s current Surface lineup plans:    Spring 2019: A new type of Surface-branded ambient computing device designed to address “some of the common frustrations of using a smartphone,” but that isn’t itself a smartphone.    Q4 2019: Surface Pro refresh with USB-C (finally), smaller bezels, rounded corners, and new color options.    Q4 2019: AMD-based Surface Laptop — Microsoft is exploring using the Picasso architecture.    Late 2019: Microsoft’s foldable tablet Andromeda could be larger than earlier small form factor prototypes for a pocketable device with dual screens and LTE connectivity.    Q1 2020: Surface Book update that might include new hinge designs (high-end performance parts may delay availability).    2020: A Surface monitor, and the modular design debuted for Surface Hub 2 could make its way to Surface Studio. The idea is to bring simple upgrades to all-in-one PCs, rather than having to replace the whole computer.Surface aside, Sams notes that Microsoft is also exploring two revisions to the Xbox One S for 2019. The first does not have an optical disk drive and is meant to be “the lowest possible entry price for the Xbox family,” while the other has a disk drive but is meant to be “cost-reduced” in comparison to the initial Xbox One S release. Microsoft also plans to offer a disc-to-digital trade-in program that would let gamers turn their physical games into a digital license for easy download.""",

"After getting 50% haircut from the top it is currently trading fairly with forward projection of $0.75 for 2020 as AMD management has stated. That drop was Fast and Furious not for the faint of heart. During the last drop AMD stock touched 200 SMA on Oct 29. I’ve been in the market for quite a while but still learning that the street tends to throw a curveball time to time as seen in both AMD and Lumentum - Lumentum lost 32% yesterday. It seems it is a norm to drop 30% or more with one spin these days. Regarding AMD, it’s great to know the base price is $20 for 2019 with modest expected revenue gains. With recent AWS win there is a strong possibility AMD to garner at least 10% data center market with EPYC 2 backfilling 2018 estimate in 2019. My optimistic estimate only calls out for $7200m but it could reach up to $7400m in 2019 with additional EPYC wins and orders, and the SP could trade between $18.50 to $40 depending on the market and wind conditions. Clearly, there is a $400m difference between Dr. Ma’s estimate. Regardless, I interpret this article as an implied BUY if it falls below $20 for long term investment.

"I have to say, I wonder quite a bit what is the actual reason that EPYC is at 2% market share for 2018.  This is well below the ""conservative"" forecast of 5%.  My more optimistic number I thought AMD was likely targeting was 8%-9%.  EPYC has been out 15 months officially, and with sampling and testing before launch, more like 22-23 months for the big suppliers.So, why are Oracle and AWS just now starting to announce their first purchase of EPYC?  We're basically 9-12 months behind where we should have been in terms of the ramp.I guess we'll have to hope for a hockey stick ramp profile when 7nm EPYC hits, and hope that it hits soon.  They teased it for 2H18 release unless I'm totally mis-remembering.  I guess now they are getting by on a technicality that 7nm Instinct counts for 7nm in 2H18.  I'm not really impressed.Recall they had working silicon for this in 2015 and tape outs in spring 2017 and design finished in Q1 2018.  Apple and others have mass produced a gazillion phones on 7nm.  Granted that is easier than a 64 core EPYC chip, but still AMD was working on this years ago, I'm sure ahead of Apple.  Are they really taking 2+ years from tape out to high volume production?  Seems so.  Crazy.  If the design was finished in Feb 18 they should have started mass production within 6 months at the latest.Another point, it seems AMD doesn't know how to talk to their channel partners about supply levels.  They should have known the channel overbought for crypto well beyond their normal supply levels.  They told inventors there would be no impact and crypto was not forecast for any revenue in Q3, and when they say that, as an investor I take that to mean they have discussed this with the channel partners before hand.  This is an unbelievable oversight that cost investors huge sums.I will be watching closely to see how nVidia handles this GPU glut on Thursday.  I feel like it is a tossup whether they get hit hard, or they did a better job of forecasting or perhaps they strong armed the channel to force cards on them anyway to smooth it out.

And I'm willing to bet we hear alot more about this come January 4th, and less about Investigations. The DEM's will get more mileage ""saving the US consumer from Trump"" than from Investigations. They will begin hammering Trump on this come January, and, they will be Relentless at trying to Blame Everything they can on him for ""Causing Pain on US Consumers"" - meaning everyone in the US.

"A couple of points:BB has repositioned itself as an enterprise software company. I doubt they'll start selling to consumers. They might sell to partners (eg Comcast, and others) who want to include Malware protection in the products but that won't be their main focus.In BB's target market (enterprise), Malware protection is not free. ALL major companies pay for this and the large companies pay millions of dollars per year. That's why Symantec, McAfee, Trend, etc. etc. have billions of combined revenue in this space.Cylance would broaden BB's solution and give them a good reason to have a discussion with any large enterprise. Imagine they more or less include malware protection if customers buy their mobile security. ""Mr customer: You're paying $2M / year to Symantec today, buy our solution that includes mobile security + malware protection for e.g. $2.3M / Year"". That would get them a lot of meetings with potential customers and make them a more strategic vendor.",

Symantec, McAfee (I know), Sophos, Trend, and the others have caught up. Kaspersky isn't giving up so easily.

"So, while I'm still thinking about KIA's altogether top-notch research, I thought I'd add a quibble on the idea that the previous acquisitions of Movirtu and SecuSmart didn't ""have legs."" 1. Movirtu cost BB $34.5m. ""Following the acquisition of Movirtu in fiscal 2015, the Company introduced the WorkLife by BlackBerry solution, which provides a virtual SIM allowing the only true carrier grade split billing solution for mobile devices and complements BlackBerry’s Secure Work Space and BlackBerry Balance offerings. WorkLife by BlackBerry distinguishes between work use and personal use of a smartphone by assigning a separate work number on a BYOD device and splitting the cost of voice minutes, SMS and data used for work versus personal use.""This is a genuinely important piece of BB's EMM offerings today, and it's also a key part its long-term partnership with Samsung Knox. 2. SecuSmart has large contracts with the governments of Germany and Canada, with possibly more unannounced or undisclosed contracts. Just today, a contact of mine who is in the US military said (perhaps too hopefully) that top brass is considering deployment of Secusmart, but of course we will all await signs of confirmation. The Secusmart connection also led BB into a partnership with IBM and Samsung on government-military-grade security for tablets. www.pcworld.com/... All in all, I think the Secusmart acquisition has paid off handsomely for BB. There is no doubt that the WatchDox, AtHoc, and Good Tech acquisitions were all brilliant.",
"Just wanted to add a couple of random thoughts: 1. Cylance sounds like a perfect partner for Jarvis in automotive -- OR like a replacement for Jarvis. 2. Cylance has just recently moved into the retail antivirus space. It was free until the recent American elections, but now ""You can pay $29 for a year or $39 for two years — which covers you for a single device. Alternatively, you can cough up $69/$79 or $99/$99 for five devices and 10 devices, respectively.""If you look up the top 7 antivirus products, they all have at least 100m customers. Haha, suppose Cylance gets to one-tenth of that level in the next two years. At $29 per annum, that's $290m from the retail level alone.",
"KIA: you wrote, ""BlackBerry UEM licenses are device-based licenses that allow organizations to use BlackBerry UEM features. To use other BlackBerry enterprise products, such as blackberry 2FA, BlackBerry Enterprise Identity, and BlackBerry Workspaces, with BlackBerry UEM, customers need to purchase separate licenses for those products. This product structure would suggest that the antivirus/antimalware capabilities would be a separately licensed component of the overall BlackBerry UEM offering.""Check out BB's brochure on all this: www.blackberry.com/... There are five levels of EMM licensing: at the higher levels, features like 2FA, enterprise identity, and WorkSpaces are added into the bundle. It is also possible to buy WorkSpaces, e.g., as a standalone or separate product. Here's a more detailed version of the same five-edition breakdown: www.blackberry.com/... BB used to include prices for each level, but it looks as if they've stopped doing that. My memory is that it the lowest level was something like $5/month and the highest level (including WorkSpaces) was something like $35/month. It may seem as if we're essentially talking about the same thing, but not really, as the vast majority of buyers of WorkSpaces probably buy it as part of ""Content Edition"" bundle. But back to the issue of which company BB is presently using to take care of its anti-malware needs, and how much they're paying that company per year. I'm guessing that Windows Defender is playing a role in some of the deals, especially in the packages where customers are using Azure and a lot of MSFT apps. It would in fact be interesting to know how much BB is paying to use 3rd-party anti-malware. IF BB buys Cylance, they'd be eliminating that cost as you point out as well as making money from new sales.",

While Amazon grew online to start and is now spending LOTS of money building out its distribution infrastructure (and workforce), Walmart was built in the opposite direction and it now has far more 'distribution warehouses' in the form of its stores than Amazon does.  The question is, can WMT build out the e-commerce infrastructure and audience at a lower cost than Amazon spends building out its distribution buildings and work force. Of course Amazin could just buy Target and that would be a big step since many also have grocery as well. I personally use Walmart's grocery service and they've stolen my business from Meijer.  I order online and pick up at a store on my way home.  When I am in a store, there are sometimes as many 'order pickers' filling orders in the aisles as there are customers.

"""Indeed, Tesla sales in Norway are struggling to keep pace with 2017 levels, not a great sign for a company on a high growth trajectory.""What a meaningless statement.

"In November 2017, Tesla sold 998 cars, they are at 55 or so November 2018 until the 13th. They don't sell on weekends, so its about another 13 days of sales, each day of which has to be ~65 S + X - to match last year. Then there is Dec 2017, which was a record 2400 more. We will know in two weeks about November, not long after that for Dec.",
Makes sense since these are initial Ipace cars to early adopters. Let’s see how it does when the model 3 comes to Norway where the mid range gets more range for 25k cheaper,
"@John Engle Well perhaps Tesla who is still producing S &amp; X in large numbers...1. Did not ship much if anything in Q3 to Norway or internationally because that were raking up sales in the USA to maximize the cutoff the Federal Consumer Tax Credits - which has been proven because they held back shipments in Q2 domestically2.

The math already shows twice as many Model 3s delivered in Q3 as Model S and X.   This is the future of Tesla - and - frankly, the sales in Norway of the Model S and X are increasingly irrelevant to the future of Tesla.Tesla now longer needs to sell any Model S or X in any market if it is not profitable to do so...as long as quarterly sales remain around 20,000 - 25,000 the company is not concerned.",
The relevant question is the number of BEVs vs. ICE vehicles sold in Norway. That could be a bellwether for the rest of Europe.,

"i-Pace is the new shiny object, so sales often spike in the beginning. Unfortunately I-Pace owners will find out that the range is way below the rating as several testers concluded and owners overpaid for this privilege.

I believe the horrible front end they added to the Prius V in 2015 killed its sales and subsequently the model.,

"It's really hard to leave an ecosystem like AAPL.I'm an Android game (Android phones + Google Play Music + Google Drive + Google Photos + Nvidia Shield TV) but my brother is an AAPL guy (iPhone, iPad, Cloud, AAPL music, AAPL TV).Yesterday he was asking me about the Nvidia shield TV and if he should get it for his second TV in the bedroom. My answer was Why? he wouldn't be able to use his AAPL services, Cloud, AAPL music with the Shield.Once you get stuck on one of these ecosystems, it doesn't make much sense to switch, it actually will make your life more difficult by switching.Unfortunately, an iPhone or an Android is only good for a year or two under heavy usage like most people use them nowaday. They break, the batteries degrade, people drop them and wreak them. If you are an AAPL guy, you need to keep buying AAPL products.One can argue that growth may slow or even go to nil, but the people hooked on AAPL will continue to buy their product for many years to come and they will continue selling them at high margins.

""Is Amarin still an acquisition target? Yes, most definitely."" And he goes on to speculate about Amgen buying the company ""Amgen sells Repatha, the PCSK9-targeted, cholesterol-lowering injectable. Slotting Vascepa into its existing salesforce would be a no-brainer.""And his feedback from those who write the scripts ""Every cardiologist I spoke with believes Vascepa is providing cardiovascular benefit, so that’s a win for Amarin.""",
I am going to put this in here in hope that the people here will read it and learn how the shorts are manipulating to get your money off of you. This drop was never about the Mineral Oil issue. That issue is a dead issue there is much better science at play and the FDA approval is all but guaranteed jsut like the above authors opinion.What is happening here is following of the script as detailed in the Washington Post news that came out in 2014. Down to the threat of a phantom lawsuit. And the players remain the same as well. Sad and Tragic. Read it all.Step 1 Short Selling Step 2 Phantom Lawsuit to drive the price lowerStep 3. Fake spins on news to alarm investorsStep 4 - Repeat Read it all below just for BioPharma stocks too www.washingtonpost.com/...,
I am long AMRN and I expect great things to happen!,
Does anyone know whether or not the physicians voting positively for Vascepa after AHA presentation knew about the placebo discrepancies at that time ?,
"If these were in opaque capsules why put any oil at all in placebo?  What about details of the mineral oil, oxidation, impurities?  Oxidized lipids raise small dense LDL which is worse than regular LDL.",
"Am I reading this correctly? You're saying that increased LDL-C in the placebo cohort, potentially a result of the mineral oil used, actually resulted in fewer AE's, not more?If that is the case then shouldn't Amarin be arguing that the positive ReduceIt trial results are being slightly understated as a result of the mineral oil placebo, and not overstated as everyone seems to be assuming?",
did everyone see the bogus class action release which even quoted Dr rx ..this came out at i think 230 ish today and is why is went into free fall ..almost every company hit with these now with law firms just trying to get any SHICK to stick..they even quoted Dr Rx post on SA as a pretense for their lawsuit ...i found that really self serving as they take a SA contributor to be some sort of expert..that should leave them open to a frivolous counter...anyway Tesla got bombed with these and all it did was create opportunity...the stock was vulnerable yes but this move on this was way over done should be made up b4 end of week..lets see,
"A lot seems to hinge on the ReduceIt SPA, and the fact that FDA signed off on everything.Do you think there is any possibility that the FDA might rescind that ReduceIt SPA, as they did with the previous Anchor SPA? That's the thing that concerns me the most. I was a casualty of the Anchor SPA being rescinded, something I considered impossible since it never happened before then.Once burned, twice shy!",
No worries. This goes back up nicely tomorrow.,
I was able to get out this morning  @ $18.66. Now I'll wait a few days and pick-up for the left- overs???? This is fun!,
"Now the inevitable......of course!!! Down 20%+ !!!NEW YORK , Nov. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of Amarin Corporation plc (""Amarin"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: AMRN).  Such investors ...",
down to 15.13 now....,
"down 16%? seriously, wtf!",
AMRN investors stops getting wiped out again today. When will people learn?,
i don't know how AMRN plays out over the long term lets say even 6months or longer time frame but near term the momentum hot money is no longer dealing with a slam dunk consensus and Doctor Market doesnt like that when a stock is priced to perfection. .. this stock ran from 3 to 23 and a mkt cap of over 6 billion on the potential ..i expected selling all along after one of the most over anticipated dates of the press release ..this is just layering on due to the lack of obvious consensus. I ask myself now what are the next possible news events and i ask for help on these. 1) FDA Submission and or approval to increase labeling 2) potential stock offering always was in my consideration and surprised company hasn't done it yet.3) further commentary from the medical community 4) further updates from the analyst community 5) more unlikely over the near term a BO 6) continued market weakness which affects all or a market rally of some magnitude which puts some risk money back in play. cant think of anything else that may have an impact ..but would love to hear some opinions,
"Lipitor product insert itself state that ""Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25% and 9%, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDL-C reduction is similar whether LIPITOR is given with or without food.""I think mineral oil kind of fat rich diet.Similarly, Plasma LIPITOR concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration [see Dosage and Administration (2)].I think this mineral oil issue with respect to statin activity is not true from absorption point of view.",
"Will chime in with the others - a very well written article, not a pump, not a bash, pretty even keeled - well done. However, I take issue with this statement:""The mineral oil issue has sparked controversy again and is something that could cause near-term volatility for the stock and slower uptake for Vascepa. The net benefit is quite substantial even if we discount all the issues, but it's clear that many physicians have concerns about it.""The ""many physicians"" appear to only be the ones quoted by AF and Forbes - Dr. Sanjay Kaul, a KOL in cardio space, isn't concerned at all. And with 87% of the docs who watched the presentation at the AHA, > 2000 of them, saying they'd prescribe V to their at risk patients, I'd to with their opinions instead of those from docs with axes to grind (hello Dr. Nissen).",
Anyone consider that it could be Big Pharma who is involved in driving the price down to force Amarin to sell by denying them the much needed cash they need to go it alone?,
"Good article, thank you. I think what really brings the mineral oil issue into question (besides short attacks and attacks from those with competing interests) is the unexplained mechanism of action in the treatment arm. Because patients in the treatment arm benefit independent of LDL reduction, it’s clear these oils act in an unknown and perhaps complex manner. Mineral oil does not just lower statin absorption (the effect on statins is clearly minor), but could affect absorption of many lipophilic compounds, including things like vitamin C and D which may have cardio-protective properties. Furthermore, a small amount is absorbed systemically and may be biologically active. Just as EPA is speculated to cause membrane stabilization and prevent plaque rupture, it’s possible mineral oil does the opposite. Overall EPA clearly does improve bio markers that are associated with cardiovascular benefit and downside is low. But we can say little about mortality or MACE reduction. Not every drug that lowers cholesterol reduces adverse cardiac events. Ezetimibe for example lowers LDL-c but with mixed outcome results.  The magnitude of benefit is critical not just for assessing cost-benefit but also for physicians to be able to have an informed discussion with patients. Adding more drugs to a patient’s daily regimen is not without potential harm. Patients are more likely to be noncompliant with all medications, or take their medications incorrectly (missed or extra doses) if more drugs are added to their daily regimen. Elucidating the magnitude of benefit is a critical issue that still needs to be addressed in order for patients and physicians to make an informed decision",
"No one had to tell me. Trust me, NO ONE can scare me away from what I know is the most assured blockbuster stock in the market.Why do you think they are trying to scare as many of us away as they can? Think about it?A small pharma that has a reputation of bad business decisions, has discovered the most advanced machine to fight the number one failure of the human body, ""{Heart Failure!""Don't believe me? What can you do if your heart stops?How long can you live?You cannot live if your heart fails. So we want our heart moving along without any hint of a problem. However, billions of humans have some sort of genetic fault that leads them to become more susceptible to having some sort of heart failure, whether it be a slight murmur or the big one. Since the cause of heart failure is wide ranging, we need a security gate that will reduce your chances of having the big one.Well that is what Amarin's REDUCE-IT does by an astonishing 25%. Yet there are those who are hung up on the placebo used to psychologically make the test subject think they are getting the test drug. All the questions surrounding the placibo have been responded to and 87% of all the cardiovascular Drs and scientists at the Chicago presentation said they are ready to give it ti their patience.So if you do not own Amarin you should by it now since the shorts have driven the price down. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.",
"Great trial results, great conference data, and a massive run up in stock price which appears to be very justified.  Short term an overhang of dilution remains, the CEOs answer to needing raise  cash was not very convincing.  I think it happens within two weeks and will be very well received and give them much needed ammo.    I think those waiting around for a bo are going to be waiting awhile.   I took my profits pre market yesterday and will reenter if a secondary is announced.  I may miss the boat but thats the game.    Good luck to you longs.",
Understand that New Journal of Medicine is peer reviewed by the country's top medical / clinical scientists before it is published. + FDA scientific review & approval.Both are happy with the conclusions & the experiment design. Massive 25% risk reduction. Back up the truck boys. Beep beep.,
"When the statins just came out, there were some concerns about the safety issues as well. That's why there is a need in the education of patients by the KOLs, physicians, sale reps, etc.My main concern is actually if Amarin can get enough source of fish oil to meet the demand, globally, over the next decades.  Would the demand force the fishermen catch more fish, resulting in loss of ecosystem in the ocean? Who's going to do a benefit/cost analysis on that?",
Hard to purify EPA. Generic fish oil capsules like prescription Omega 3 EE has both DHA and EPA. DHA increases LDL while EPA does not. Also if you want to get the 4 grams of EPA with generic omega 3 EE you will have to likely take about twice as many capsules.,
"You can't base a conclusion on belief. The hard data shows concerns as you pointed out. Actually, the mineral oil question is not the only concern. The fact that EPA oil at 4 grams led to lowering cardiac effect leads to the question.....can others duplicate the same outcome using regular EPA at 4 grams and the answer is yes, the Jelis study. This leads to the potential of getting the same effects using generics.",
Have a buy till cancel @14.87. Hope it hits!,
"It should be noted that both the Forbes article and the Stat article (Feurstein's) were posted almost simultaneous to the release of the full data set on Saturday.That makes it sort of obvious these were written ahead of time, with an axe to grind.  The vote taken at the meeting on whether the docs would prescribe for their patents is the main takeaway on acceptance and likely label expansion.With no adverse effects, how can FDA not expand the label?  Even if their was some mineral oil effect, it was minor, and the overall stats are pretty compelling.  That 'negative placebo effect' was no an effect of Vascepa, so there was no safety concern raised at all.This is a winner.",
"thanks, nice article, well written, factual. amazing how different people can analyze the same data and have opposite opinions on such. we shall see who's correct in the coming weeks/ months.",
https://t.co/liOtzRFkaG?amp=1,
"Do you know that in jupiter trial , subgroup where ldl under 70 & hsCRP > 2, showed 40% RRR with statin which btw reduces hsCRP by 25-40%.",
"Really nicely written. The efficacy seen in REDUCE-IT is unparalleled in the CVD space counting the mega trials past two decades. That hs-CRP and LDL-C increased somewhat is to be expected to a certain degree. The patients had active disease and where in the trial for years. Although well treated, there is residual risk and markers if disease activity increase as the disease progresses. In my mind, there is not doubt that R-IT represents a paradigm shift and will most likely have a fast uptake in the market, globally. Good old hockey stick sales :-)",
I've been on vascepa for 6 months and it lowered my insulin resistance to the point I no longer need metformin.  a trial of one but it helped this pre diabetic,
"Great article, thanks!",

"There isn't a profitless biotech stock that isn't subject to multiple hit pieces and short manipulation. They, the shorts, use the same arguments regardless of the company and the product. It won't get approved, it wont sell, it has too many side effects, a capitol raise will be necessary, management is awful etc.  ad nauseam. Sometimes they're right sometimes they're wrong, just like the rest of us. When they're right longs loose a lot of $. When they're wrong longs make a lot of $. In the case of Amarin I'm betting the shorts will be taking Vascepa before too long. Bon chance!",

"Generally good article, at least pointing out the overwhelming success of the R-it trial. A little disappointed that you were not more incredulous about the FAKE NEWS concerning mineral oil. The only impact mineral oil had was to be used as a red herring to distract and confuse a few nervous investors. It is a mute point now anyway since the faint of heart regarding mineral oil threat left the building early today and have been replaced by more informed investors. I really wish more had been done to explain how flawed the mineral oil claimants were, primarily being physicians claiming a fish oil derivative would never show positive results and are now trying to find some way to avoid further loss of their credibility.",

Excellent. Only wish it was on this forum earlier maybe on the weekend itself to counter hit jobs by Forbes and thier ilk (no quotes from anyone actually runnng the trial - WTF?).

"Well written, Thanks",
"Excellent writing here.  I was a bit taken back with Steve Niesen's quote in the Forbes article that ""we"" had not seen increases in LDL in placebo groups before.  That is a troubling comment from someone with that level of knowledge.  I also wish someone would comment about dosage of mineral oil.  It is indeed true that there are a plethora of effects with consuming mineral oil daily......when an adult consumes 15 ml or more per day.  I need someone to explain how those little capsules would have any where near that dose of mineral oil.  And lastly, if we forget about placebo group altogether, when have we seen a CV mortality rate of 4.3% in a statin trial with a patient population like this?  How is it that the critics are so casual to ignore the absolute CV mortality rate in the treatment arm for this study?",
I have been a member of Growth Stock Forum for almost 2 years. Amount of work and effort this guy puts is tremendous. You will miss a lot if you don't try 2 weeks free trial of Growth Stock Forum marketplace.,
"I would like to also point out the following: Ldl cholesterol tends to rise with age. With or without mineral oil, it is to be expected that some of the placebo group would have an increase during the years of the study. Vascepa was shown to slightly reduce ldl cholesterol in the Anchor and Marine short-term studies. Vascepa is obviously restraining the ldl progression due to aging, which leads to a divergence in the two groups.",

"I drive for Grub also p/t. In my Market in downtown Miami things are really starting to pick up. When I started last year, Grubhub was way behind UE in brand name recognition. Grub had not really established a presence yet. They had barely started doing their own deliveries. When I started I would routinely talk to store managers and employees to get a first hand look at how things were really going for grub in the streets. Most restaurants unfortuneately for grub were getting most of their orders from UE. On average it was like 8/10 were ue or 80% market share here in Miami. Well today I have these same conversations with managers and they tell me it is getting really close but UE is still in the lead. I talk to many other drivers also from all of the other food service apps and almost all of them want to work for grub. Grub has the best pay for drivers and is not always hiring like the others. In the end with grubs very proffesional customer service team I think they will prevail. I am not sure either, but I think that recent aquisition of level up should soon start to help grub really start to seperate itself from all of the competition. Every time I go into most of these restaurants they all got all of these tablets set up for each and every food delivery app. If grub can find a way to make the order integration for the restaraunts even better and smoother for their employees I think that will also help alot. anyways that is my 2cents of info from being a gh delivery driver/ investor.",

I will hold on for the turnaround.,
I got a program in my brain that says this company is cheap.,
"@Chillin' Out I sold the January 2020 20 strike puts for $4.00 last week and thought I would share my idea. The beta of NWL is massive so the premium is very large at this time. I will do my best to answer your interesting questions:1) IF you are long NWL equity and write covered calls you are mitigating some of the risk of holding NWL. Of course, you are going to give up some of the upside for getting the premium,but because the premiums are so large right now (because of the increased volatility) I am interested in taking in someone else’s dollars (that why I sold the “inflated” puts) right now.2) The common dividend could definitely get cut so the 0.92 is important, but not critical. By selling the 20 puts for $4.00 all I am saying is that I am interested in buying the NWL equity. Between now and January 17, 2020 at $16 and I am laying out nothing but they are holding part of my SMA while time goes by. IF NWL goes flat for a few months the $4 premium I took in will definitely decrease and I can buy back the $4 premium I received for a much lower amount and take my profit. Further, my analysis said that the best “deal” or time premium/strike price was the January $20, 2020. IF I was to go down in strike price I will get less premium and the correlation to share price will be much different than I am looking for.3) you pose a good question and only time will tell if writing shorter options would have been a better choice. My deep and through analysis (I have a computer program for options I built on my own) said the best risk reward for what I was trying to accomplish was the 20 strike of January 2020.I urge EVERYONE to do your own deep due diligence before investing any of your dollars and please do not blindly listen to any “professional” writer or financially analyst that may not have your best interests in mind.Wishing you profitable investing, Nomad",
"A good NWL strategy is to sell the Newell January 17, 2020 $20 strike puts to open for $4.00. If you have to buy the stock your cost basis would be $16 and if the equity stays above $20 you get the $4 per share. Wishing you profitable investing, Nomad",
"Likewise, bought in ahead of the curve downward, but feeling more comfort as the price has risen. NWL seems to have a little bite of LB written all over it...Long: NWL IEP",

"@James Brumley >>Analysts have spoken, and most of them agree Apple’s decision to no longer report unit sales of iPhones is a tacit indication that unit sales of iPhones have at least reached a plateau, if not peaked.<<While this may be true, Apple has been saying this in their quarterly reporting for a few years now.The yearly total of phones sold has been 215 million per year. If all these analysts don’t know this and are surprised to find this out because of the recent quarterly call I know a few grade  school kids who can do a better job at analyzing the company.",
Thanks for your work.  This is the most useful article I have read on Apple in quite some time.  Apple is clearly becoming a service company and will be viewed that way more and more over time.The only thing I would have to disagree with are the gross margin estimates for the iPhones.  Given how high a percentage iPhone is to Apple's overall revenue I don't see how the gross margin could be in the 60% range and the overall margin be around 38%.  Macs and iPads may be lower margin but the sales there just aren't high enough to drag the overall gross margin down that far.  In fact my biggest concern as a shareholder is that the continuing commoditization of smart phones in general will put enough margin pressure on Apple that the services business margin will not be enough to offset the decline.  In my valuation model for Apple I cannot project improving future margins until they prove me wrong.  And I hope they do!,
I'm waiting for the iPhone XXX.,
If I was a trader I would get out too. Lucky for me I invest in companies.,
Just keep on Reinvesting those dividends and smile!!!!,
I quit listening to analysts back in the late 1970s. It was a very good move.,
Two and a half  years ago AAPL dropped from $132.78 down to $93.51. Oh the drama! Bears were flying their Apple flags at half-staff mourning the death of stock investors’ favorite growing fruit. Thus far the current drop is less in absolute price drop and percent drop. We’ll see what happens this time.,
Regardless of quarterly unit sales - which might be stagnant or decrease FROM PREVIOUS QUARTERS - the total number of active Apple devices is going to increase.  Selling 50 million new Apple devices in a quarter DOES NOT mean that an existing 50 million Apple devices were deactivated.,
The most important numbers are the top line and the bottom line. As long as each is growing the rest of it is just noise.,
On Nov 14 the US Gov't will auction off 5-G Bandwidths. In the next 2 to 5 years APPL will experience the greatest unit sales cycle ever.  We won't know the unit sales numbers but it's pretty easy to read the bottom line.Existing customers will update their current phones and other relevant equipment or else they forfeit the significant advantages offered by 5-G. Technology. The center or command post of 5-G is the smartphone. I'm sure this hasn't escaped Apple's management.,
"Without a major metric of unit sales, AAPL will never be $1T again.  If Apple wants to jack up the ASP, more power to them.  They will lose their fan base, including myself, Don’t Let the service revenues change the narrative.  The real threat is in China and India.",
"Maybe they should go private, that way they could keep all their numbers to themselves in a dark room. ......sarcasm",
"Just watching a bunch of uninformed rabbits run away from AAPL today....   cute.By my metrics, Huawei and Samsung are deep into last place with their phones.  Apple makes all the profit.  There are two kinds of organizations.... FOR profit and NOT FOR PROFIT.   It's not ""FOR UNIT SALES"" and ""NOT FOR UNIT SALES"".  Second place is what is split by 600 Android OEMs.    Actually, I'd rather call it last place.So....  Apple is looking at reduced share count, growing profit based on a huge user base used to spending money on stuff that works and gets updated, and is profitable today, and doesn't have to sell bidets (like Samsung) or spring for CEO bail (like Samsung.)Samsung does have that special ""folding"" phone it won't show or let anyone touch and that will be out ""in March"", which is reminiscent of Joseph Smith's Golden Tablets In A Sack, Trust Me"" scam.Good god.  This entire affair really gets old.

"You are probably sick of me commenting on EZPW.   But does the current valuation make any possible sense to you?  I am very surprised (and more poorer) after the decline in share price over the past few months.On metrics like Price/Sales, EBITDA/EV the valuations seem crazy out of whack compared to FCFS (which admittedly has had better operating performance over the past decade and has a dividend and share repurchase program)",
"Another good write-up.  I think getting PLO growth in the United States going forward will be tough, barring a major economic downturn or a spike in gold prices. The FCFS management are solid operators.  I'm impressed by their capital allocation. Unfortunately, I have had my money in EZPW.  They report tomorrow.   If they disappoint (again), I will switch to FCFS.

"NFLX is probably a buy after this dip, agree with you there. You know what else is a buy? GAIA.Here's whyseekingalpha.com/...",
"9x revenues is not a normalized ratio, it’s eggetiously expensive, unless they were operating with like 85% gross margins. Netflix’s margins are closer to 17% (I think) and real net margins are negative, so 9x revenues is ridiculous to use as a base case. The company is still growing quite rapidly, so I’m not suggesting it should trade at market averages, but just because it’s floated in the stratosphere for many years, doesn’t mean gravity won’t hit them eventually.  They also have an impaired balance sheet, increasing competition, and developed markets are becoming saturated. They still have plenty of growth in other foreign markets, but those are lower margin, lower ARPU markets and that isn’t going to help them with their cash flow problem. I think most would agree they do still have pricing power, but probably less than many think, especially as 3rd party content is steadily removed. $12 a month is a good value for what you’re getting today, but not if all you could watch was Netflix originals. This is a high risk/ high reward stock with a lot of volatility, but it’s definitely not an attractive equity from any fundamental perspective.",
"I was a bit of a laggard to NFLX, I recently started a small position. got in at 314. While I do understand that valuation is likely to go higher, I dont know if I agree with your valuation of 385. price stands at 295.96 as of this writing, I definitely see space for growth. and I gotta admit, I am concerned with DIS, entering the space more and more aggressively. NFLX has some solid content and great market share, but the house of mouse cannot be ignored. Also, AMZN library could be drastically improved IMHO, but quite frankly their video service is more of an afterthought, and really more of a perk that comes with free 2 day shipping.",
"Unfortunately, the P/S range you use in your table is quite narrow. As such, you are valuing the company based on how it would have been valued based on future sales but using what is likely to be a very ephemeral multiple of that sales. If you take the time to look at large macro trends, market breadth, factor rotations, etc. it will become quite clear that for anyone attempting to value former high-flyers the biggest question is how much to stress test whatever multiples they apply to their future sales or earnings or free cash flow. If we enter a bear market, whatever the right answer is, it will be at least 50% below whatever you would have thought about using at the top. This is based on 21 years of investing through two amazing drops and all kinds of arguments having been read about new valuation paradigms.

Worse yet, it is dependent on a single individual who is letting go of his leadership slowly.

"dividend sensei.Is it possible that BRK bought all shares that became available to them and not because that's all they wanted to buy?  If more were available they would have bought more.  The daily volume is 4.3 million shares; not much for a company their size.  Also they bought back shares at around 1.4x BV so my bet is that intrinsic value is $250 or more; Morningstar's value of $220 is probably too low.  Using your 25% discount you could buy at $187 and do very well, but you may wait a long time to hit that price as BRK has given a strong signal that $207 is a good price to buy at.",
"After watching this video (see below) which I learned of thru Seeking Alpha, I realized that Buffett is living off his past success.

And I don't mean to be rude or to be biased in any way but when you get old, you tend to stick with the people you have worked with in the past and because of joint pains, people are less likely to travel so you acquire and sell based on the advice you get from others.

Traditional valuation ratios don't work very well, especially with respect to calculating true free cashflow. I doubt that Warren would buy  BRK if he was not its CEO.$BRK.B",

A lot of the decline in the market has nothing to do with earnings or ratios etc. but the value of the US dollar tied to WTI oil price because sine the 1970's the dollar has been backed by whatever the WTI price is and anything priced in US Petrodollars like equities usually suffers when the oil price drops.  Right now they're using the oil price as a political weapon against Iran, Venezuela and Russia to possible regime change which might take awhile-if they succeed?   In the 2008-9 ""crash"" oil led market direction and stocks bottomed in March 2009 when oil did.   I'll keep out until I see the bottom in oil prices like before then load up.

"Sounds like the author is echoing the bears.  Yes China trump tariffs, strong dollar and developing countries stagnant or in recessions, some due to strong dollar so thatn's really two reasons.

Also two of the culprits including Wells fargo have done this downgrading before and have always been dead wrong. wells fargo has downgraded Apple when it was at 195 then went to 233. and that Kuo analyst is only right 50% of the time. He has spies at Asian factories but even at those factories they have no idea why Apple might be ordering fewer units. Cold be they are using a second factory. Could be a lot of reasons.

In fact unless trump screws up royally and refuses to fix the problems he himself created, we shojld be back in the 230's by February, and people will look back at today and kick thmselves for not buying.  In other words, as an AAPPl investor for 20 years I can assure this this is just more of the same usual BS, with some real headwinds mixed in, but those headwinds are something Apple will suffer less than others. Also reember that with some 240 billion in cash , Apple can play the currency and interest rate markets and has very smart people doing this for them. and they also must be buying a ton of shares right now.

"Sean Chandler is an incredibly ignorant car guy. The world's automakers are by and large developing electric cars,not ICE vehicles. The only thing keeping electric cars positioned at the higher price levels is obvious to even the least auto knowledgeable : the cost of batteries. Right now, no one can build a $23,000 electric car that can perform satisfactorilly as a private vehicle, and that includes Tesla who recently said that if they tried to build a $35,000 bare bones Model 3, they would go bankrupt. The only Model 3 cars Tesla has built are high end $50,000 and up (way up) versions.  The major automakers have announced their plans for the next several years andthey will pour out well over 250 electric vehicles. Tesla is doomed.

There is a waiting list for the Taycan, but its competitor Tesla Model S is being discounted and production scaled back. Likewise, the Jaguar I Pace has displayed a rapid increase in sales far ahead of its Tesla competitor, the Model X, and reviews have consistently favored the I Pace over the unreliable and highly priced Model X.  And this is just the first of dozens of Model X competitors coming down the pike, from respected automakers who have hundreds of millions of loyal ustomers, who are unlikely to take a chance with a company as controversial (and greedy) as Tesla Motors, run by a controversial eccentric who may very well spend a goody portion of his future life in prison.

"I am not sure whether the author lives in a bubble wherein Tesla is the only EV.    Hello, there is the rest of the word out here, a world that today sells much more EV than Tesla in part because rational consumers do not require tax concessions on stupid long range toys for rich people.For MOST owners in cities ranging from China to Germany to South Africa, a commuter EV with 200 mile range is ideal if it costs a fair price of say $25k before options.",
"The VW is a bit more suited to European roads.  Haven't seen anything on US safety compliance yet, which tends to raise the base price.  Plus the possibility of tariffs...doubtful they can import it as a $23k car.  As others have pointed out, not a direct competitor to Model 3, but a complementary EV.Haven't seen a lot of details on this vehicle other than this article, but it might be more of a  competitor to Model 3:  agirlsguidetocars.com/...    The advantage it has is that it fits the major consumption model of SUV's vice sedans.Tesla has indeed been a class leader and pioneer.  Remains to be seen if its financials will allow that to continue or if it goes the way of other pioneers like the Tucker, Stanley steamer, etc.  Not hating on them...truly innovation at work, but to bring out a US EV sedan when sedans as a model are being shed, might be a market misread.  The above crossover (if properly executed) may be the right tech/EV at the right time.",

"Author,Nice article overall, had to skim it.  Ignore most of the comments from people that don't understand what's happening.One note.  tesla isn't in competition with other legacy auto companies when it comes to building EVs.  Stronger competition will likely come from other start ups.  Legacy still doesn't anticipate nor do they know how to deal with the rapid decline in ICE vehicle sales that is just now becoming manifest.It will be clear what's happening in late 2019.  And ignored until then.  By 2023, about 50% of ICE sales will have crashed and no legacy company is taking action to survive the crash in ICE sales.  Drop in passenger cars is just the tip of the iceberg and once Model Y arrives, SUVs will crash and after that, pickups.  Ford will probably survive the longest and then plummet the hardest as it's sales too precipitously crash.EV companies, meanwhile, will enjoy a steady and predictable rise following expected exponential trendlines.By 2025 nearly 70% of ICE sales will have been lost, but EVs won't have yet grown large enough to fully fill the demand.  So, until toward 2030, EV sales will be production limited.  Finally, oil will find itself drowning in a glut by 2023 and crashing oil prices will slow EV adoption a little.  But, the demise of transportation oil and legacy ICE makers is underway.rt",

"My sister in law had a vw diesel that got recalled and replaced with a gasoline car. VW is still paying out the wazoo for the emissions lying.  How much trust will they have with customers when they ask them to buy their electric car?  Will the batteries live? Will the efficiency be there?  If vw truly delivers a car for 23000 that has a 40 kwh pack, it will hurt Nissan and worse, gm.  It won’t touch Tesla.....not with a 10 foot pole. And VW’s quality will suck for at least a year.  If they don’t have over the air updates, their customers will hate having to go back to the stealerships for software updates.",
"@author <em>And <strong>if</strong> a Tesla is still a far superior vehicle consumers will still pay more to own a Tesla</em>A massive ""if"" as ""superior"" means different things to different people. The number of people whose definition of superior is the 0-60 mph time is very limited",
"Author: ""All of the sudden, buying a cheap Honda Civic in 2016 vs. a premium Model S looks like a waste of money, especially if the Model S can be put on a ride-sharing network that makes money for the driver when not in use."" This is one of the most illogical, oft-mentioned reasons for Tesla ownership that has ever existed in the investment world. Does anyone really think that an owner of a $95,000 vehicle will want to ""share"" it with any Tom, Dick or Harry who wants to use said vehicle for their special event. What owner of a $95,000 personal vehicle is looking to recover part of their cost by sharing their vehicle with strangers? Ride-sharing alleged profits would only make sense with a basic, low priced vehicle. A fleet of 'rental' ev-tesla-cars is far different than the individual owners of high-priced EVs.Also, Author says: ""It’s important to remind investors that consumers don’t choose to own a Tesla because it’s electric. Consumers choose to own a Tesla because they’re superior vehicles."" No, you are wrong there, albeit partially right. Consumers of Teslas do choose ownership solely because it's an EV (feel good greenies).The fact that it can be superior in many ways is an added bonus. Of course, at what cost is it superior is often the deciding ownership factor. The average customer will probably not be willing to spend $50k plus to be green, regardless of the performance attributes. Basic transportation/utility is by far the deciding factor for the average, predominate customer.",
"The global market for new cars is about 70M p/a. VW selling 200k  makes no dent in the market place, and will have no impact on Tesla. It does help to make buyers used to BEVs and thus establish them as a serious purchase consideration. Hopefully it'll also teach VW to make BEVs a profit, and thus add another supplier to the market.",
"Ok, can someone please explain to me why Tesla bulls insist on taking a completely reasonable conclusion, and supporting it with garbage? Really, did this article need to rely on fantasy predictions (ie. just wait until your Tesla drives itself and earns you money!), misleading statistics (ie. look how the Bolt's demand has dropped 40%, while Tesla's has grown 100%...please ignore the fact that these are all pre-sales, and that the Tesla ramp is the only thing dictating quarter over quarter results, atm) and unsupported conspiracy theories (ie. legacy ICE manufacturers purposely make bad EV's to keep the public buying ICE cars)?The real argument is that, yes, this is good for Tesla. Having VW investing heavily in EV's will help grow the segment of the market. Most importantly, having more EV's on the road, will accelerate EV infrastructure development (charging stations, etc), which makes an EV a better value proposition. In particular, VW is strongest in Europe, where Tesla's presence is minuscule. Having the top manufacturer in the European market helping to put into place the infrastructure to make EV's a good value purchase, is incredibly good for Tesla's aspirations of expanding into Europe. It means that Tesla will not have to create the infrastructure to enable EV expansion the way it had to in North America, and can focus on just selling cars that will operate with existing infrastructure.So, while this article was poorly argued, and supported its conclusion with utter stupidity, the conclusion is actually totally true. I really wish Tesla loyalists would stop trying to convince people that the company is such garbage, by insisting on releasing embarrassing articles supporting Tesla. I really want to like Tesla. I really want to be a bull. But, the bulls insist on peddling so much bull (so to speak) that it makes it hard sometimes.",
The Germans don't have a chance to compete with Tesla.  The reliability of Tesla's cars is just too superior for any possible competition. That's why in the last reliability ranking Tesla got the 1st place among 27 manufacturers but it was when counting from the bottom up... Go Tesla!,

"VW is the most conservative, least innovative car companies on the planet, IMO. Their greatest innovation to date has been emissions cheating software. They were literally decades late to the large SUV party. All they’ve ever wanted to build and sell are Golfs and Golf derivatives. They produced one over-priced hybrid (Jetta) and then quickly discontinued it. All this talk about VW producing EV’s is just that: talk. Then have zero reputations credit, they still haven’t really taken full responsibility for the emissions fiasco. I think the company is composed of pathological liars and I’ll believe in their hypothetical $23,000 BEV with a 200+ mile range when I see it. Not before.",

Their EV is 150% more expensive than the same ICE model : 11K € for the ICE version and 28K € for the EV version (price taxes & VAT included in Belgium).This car is no way competition for Tesla. It is a little city car. Tesla competition will come from another VW daughter, Audi. But competition is good for innovation, increases quality, brings prices down.",

It’s not a competitor for the Model 3.  It’s narrower which is better suited for Europe than wide Teslas.  It will be solid VW build quality.  Range is not as important in Europe so expect lower range.  Can VW master the software is the question.,
"I agree with the fundamental premise here.  More EVs will hasten the transition not kill the other players.  When 99% of the market is ICE, new EVs aren't competing for the 1%.And, as some of us have been saying for a while, VW is the only automaker who's been externally freed (via scandal) from the Innovator's Dilemma.  They'll be the first (real) mover from the legacy companies.  No one else has that luxury so the rest will wait and sit on their fat ICE profits, turbocharged 4-cylinders, and 10-speed transmissions, while they float 10K unit EV trial balloons.I doubt VW will sell these at a loss, so the price implies a tiny city-commuter with ~150 mile range.",
"I am in Germany regularly and have worked with law firms suing Volkswagen. They are guilty and will lose a ton of money. Furthermore their diesel engines that are killing people are being banned in major German cities. That means the market share of EVs in these cities will skyrocket. Even if VW produces a cheap crippled car, there will be more Tesla sales in these cities because there is a much large market to sell into.Think about what will happen when India and China ban new ICE sales! Get ready to sell ICE vendors short.",
"Good article - we all know that Tesla only needs a few percent of overall vehicle sales to be wildly successful and that they very much welcome others to make EVs.  From opening up patents to being willing to share the Supercharger network (on proper terms, if course), Tesla stays true to their mission of accelerating the shift to sustainable generation and use of energy.  As a very dedicated TSLA shareholder I welcome other automakers to become the LGs, Samsungs, Sonys, Huaweis, etc. to Tesla's Apple in the EV industry.  I think there will be a few Nokias and Blackberrys also.  Bring them on and may the best company win.",

People sound like Tesla is the only automaker of relevance because all autos will be BEVs in a few years. Wrong. Most Americans still want to buy ICE and others who are looking at EVs still want the convenience and cost savings of hybrids or plug-in hybrids.After all an automobile is an automobile and you have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of all drivetrain types.",
