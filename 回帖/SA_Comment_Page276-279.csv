"Dr. Zach,       As a BTX investor should I be concerned with the competition from Astellas Pharma in the pursuit of a cure for AMD.  Wasn't Ocata much further along with a very similar operation of RPE injections before being taken over by Astellas.  Was there a problem with the legal  ownership of the source of the original stem cells in the Ocata studies?  I was never exactly clear on what actually occurred there with that issue, or was it ever an issue?     As always, we appreciate your time and talent in educating us.Best,BamMA",

The winners are penny stocks selling under $5 from the get go. Most people never hear about the potential winners until they are selling above the $10 range. Lack of analysis buy the large Wall Street firms until these winners have peaked keep these names from gaining media traction.

"I've been wearing Hanes' underwear- I mean ""innerwear""- for almost 20 years now. At first they were made in North Carolina (with inspector #6 overseeing quality control. Then they moved to the Dominican Republic - I guess inspector # 6 retired in place back in N.C. Then they moved to India (may have  stopped in Jordan before that.) Now ther ""Innerwear"" comes from Vietnam.They have made many improvements over the years, but one thing that has been notiecably failing in the past 3 years (both products from India and Vietnam) is the leg holes in their otherwise fine briefs. One that I purchased in 2015 (India) had the right leg hole so small I couldn't wear it. I put it aside to complain to Hanes, but forgot about it. Last week I pulled it out of  the to do pile and the seam between the back panel and the front had started coming apart- this usually only happens after extended wear and wash cycle.My latest purchase earlier this year- from Vietnam has slightly smaller right leg holes- must have only shipped the defective machinery from India to Vietnam.Inspector #6 would be horrified!",
"Good article.  I have been building a position in this stock over the last month. The very good ROIC tells me that the acquisitions have been accretive and made at a reasonable price.  In other words, the debt has been put to good use and is producing good cash flow. Brands mean a lot in undergarment business. People repeat buy these products much of the time. I invest with a 5 -10 year horizon. I also like the fact that they have locked in much of their long term debt at fixed rates. Interest rates are still artificially low and locking them in here makes a lot of sense to me. I look at a lot of stocks. I can't find anything good reason why these shares should trade at such a low multiple. That is rare. The big dig in the media about HBI is that the B&M retail channels are reducing sq footage. While that is true and will remain true for some time, people know that they can always go to WMT or Target or online to buy HBI's products. If you need new underwear, you need it. It will still be easy enough to find. If anything, one could argue that reduced B&M retail sq footage should help existing name brands vs  new competitors. People will seek out what they already know fits vs trying unknown products.",
"I'm very concerned about quality control with Hanes.  I've worn their socks all my life, but when I went to buy some last month they were no longer nice thick cotton, they were 90% polyester.  A lot of their reviews on Amazon mentioned shoddy construction, with socks falling apart after a few months.  I can understand if Hanes has to raise their prices, but cutting quality like that is going to ruin the company.",
I confess I don't find meaning in the graphic (exhibit 15). It's a new look to me.  Help!?,
"Since the end of 2014, Hanesbrands' long-term debt has increased from $1.6 billion to $3.7 billion. Its total debt-to-equity ratio during the same period has gone from 276% to 640%!! Rising debt levels can be dangerous as they typically mean higher interest rates especially in the current conditions being very conducive for higher inflation.  Given its increasing debt levels combined with its inability to beat shareholders' expectations, Hanes lacks the  critical horse power in terms of enterprise innovation especially in leveraging the strength of all the acquired companies. The supply chain that worked when everyone was buying from China without investing in hard assets for manufacturing is  now outdated  and not cost effective.  Hanes has almost  all of its manufacturing base outside the US - predominantly in China where they own the factories, which is also another area of concern given the current political climate. Investors have other  opportunities with far better rate of returns  and safety for their investments in the same sector.",
"Solid article, I agree HBI looks like good value here given FCF generation and opportunity for additional acquisitions. Vertical integration means they can rip out costs to achieve synergies. Unless I missed it you don't talk at all about the ongoing Project Booster to cut costs which should further reduce SG&A and improve margins.Multiple is likely compressed given the leverage profile. Not sure Nike and Gap are the correct comps though. Footwear, athleticwear, and fashion might be subject to other business drivers and have different margin structures (especially footwear).",
"Elad,  Nice artice and I apprecate your efforts.  Where did you get the WACC and Porters's 5 graphics?  Thanks",
"Elad, Great article and very well researched and written!",
I appreciate your in depth analysis. So many writers go the easy route of presenting a short superficial treatment of a stock with a catchy title simply to get clicks & lots of “atta boy” comments. Keep up the hard work of doing it right. My concern for HBI is the very competitive environments in which it operates & the fickleness of the consumer. As you point out there is intense competition in every line & as a result it must up its advertising expenses.,
"Is the assumption that HBI has ""strong, sustainable operating margins"" not somewhat unproven, especially as the article only shows operating margin up to 2015? In fact, operating margin has been declining, from 10.6% to 10.4% between FY15 and FY16 (ending 2nd January), and from 12.9% to 11.2% between CY16 and CY17? The 2017 margin decline is also apparent if one looks at individual segments, going from 22.2% to 21.4% in Innerware and from 14.0% to 13.8% in Activeware. I believe management has also guided to lower operating margins during the 1st half of 2018 as well, due to ""increased marketing investment and distribution expenses"".",

"While I don’t necessarily disagree with your numbers and other thoughts, i’ve lived in Vegas over 12 years, I will take exception that the maintaining of appearance it’s not as important as you think, we locals do know the difference between a casino that’s keeping itself presentable to all the customers that it serves versus those that don’t....hence the reason for example that many of us locals will not visit our friends should they choose to stay at Excalibur or Circus Circus....I’ll meet you at Green Valley Ranch or Red Rock, but should you decide to stay at Palace Station I’ll catch you next time around....",

The areas of the main level that were open were overstaffed and at times it felt like there were more employees than customers.  Even the parking structure was terrible, dimly lit with leaks and puddles everywhere from the rain. Purchasing the run down Palms Resort may have been a mistake for Red Rock, but keeping this property open during major renovation is an even a bigger one. RRR would have been well advised to close down for six months and have a grand reopening, rather than subject their customers to such an ongoing poor experience.",

"Host Hotels just bought a few very nice Hyatt hotels for $1 billion at a price that equates to a combined forward EBITDA multiple of 17x and a cap rate of 5%. Those are nicer properties than the average CLNS property, but it is still a good comp. The annualized EBITDA for CLNS' hotel segment is $296 million, and it has $2.6M of debt. CLNS' share of each is 94%. The company shows a $3.9 billion gross asset value for this segment, which equates to 13.18x annualized EBITDA, which is expected to increase at least 1% this year. The average hospitality REIT is trading at 12.24x 2017 EBITDA and 11.79x estimated 2018 EBITDA. That includes 15 companies. Host Hotels trades at about 11.5x EBITDA (far lower than the multiple it just paid, although the acquired properties are worth a premium). Hospitality is clearly non-core for CLNS now, so hopefully it can offload this whole segment and bring in roughly $1 billion of liquidity (~1/3 of its current market cap). The $3.9B value reflected by CLNS does seem reasonable to me. Selling this entire hospitality portfolio would also bolster confidence in the company's NAV of more than $10/share and potentially allow CLNS to accretively repurchase a lot more stock.",

Wouldn't be the first time.Just an armchair investor, could be totally wrong.",
I bought Northstar REITs for clients (thank God only 1% of liquid net worth into anything I bought) but in spite of that it is absolutely disgusting the value that clients had at the end of January being down 30% at the end of February. It has to be some sort of rip off just to look at it very simplistically. They should have kept the non traded products in place and just let him run off and return Capital to shareholders. The whole thing seems very suspicious to me. And I would not be surprised if some very intelligent class action attorneys somewhere got a hold of this. To me it is doubtful that that would ever happen but when something goes from X to x - 30% post-merger it just seems that something very shady happen.,
"Core FFO vs. ""Net Cash Flow""? Anyone know how to distinguish these? ""Net Cash Flow"" doesn't seem to be a meaningful figure depending on whether it includes capital expenditures and to what extent they are recurring. From the conference call, the company stated that the new dividend rate ""is intended to be more than amply covered by our core FFO with a fairly generous cushion."" Based on the Core FFO guidance from the call, I calculate approximately $424M or $0.74/share for 2018, including the forecast for each core asset segment, the anticipated impact of higher interest rates, the Townsend sale, and the CLNC and NRE management agreement changes. This assumes the same amount of corporate overhead as 2017 (hopefully that # is a lot lower now). My hope is that management was setting a very low bar with the most recent earnings release and guidance, and that the company will be able to repurchase a lot of stock in the near term and exceed estimates going forward. The news and tone on the conference call was such a big reversal from just a few months prior that hopefully this was a legitimate ""mea culpa"" and not a sign of more to come.",

But I kept thinking the stock was cheap and with the overall strong economy and strong asset markets, it should be fine.

Nothing about this excellent article has given me a warm and fuzzy feeling about my investment in  CLNS preferred stock.  Except that the shellacking it has recently received may have depressed the value so low that it is a buy now.  So should I buy more?  Maybe not.  There are better fish to fry.,
"Thanks for the great article John. Always enjoyed reading your research.As a self-proclaimed contrarian, I can't help being attracted to CLNS after so much blood has been shed. My understanding was that CLNY was fine on its own, and that it vastly overpaid for NRF and NSAM. As CLNS' gets closer to its standalone pre-merger market cap, that would imply buyers now are getting NSAM/NRF for free. As bad as the Colony people got hoodwinked, my thought is that the value destruction is not the tune that they paid something for nothing...do you have a handle on how much liquidation is for the entire enterprise?",

Obviously on the heavy trading and sharp price decline, the analysts and financial advisers advised institutional investors to sell, based on the reported declining margins, anticipating that promotional discounting for AEO's products will continue to be necessary to sustain sales.The fundamentals reported in Thursday's earnings all are strong, management knows how to sell AEO's products and keep SG&A expenses down, the US & Global economy is strong, consumers have more cash, reduced income tax rates...I can't see AEO's price not staying above $20 for the next 3 or 4 quarters.",Buy American Eagle's Pullback

A lot of people also do not understand that the cloud competition such as AWS EMR is a non starter for Enterprise customers because it does not offer Kerberos security features and you can’t maintain a persistent connection with a single CPU node which is a big problem for mission critical Enterprise software. So the thesis that cloud competition will mute the growth opportunity for Cloudera and Hadoop was pretty shallow and does not reflect the realities of an Enterprise software environment even before Cloudera took its superior PaaS Altus product to market.,Cloudera: Cloud Technology Could Lead To Explosive Growth
I can't agree that ALS or HIV are hidden assets.  I would strongly argue that both join the group of other disease targets (numerous) that are awaiting delivery progress to unlock their value.

CNS is a very large opportunity but the delivery has held it back.....at least so far as I referenced in my article published today,

"Thanks Investor 1954, I appreciate your professional perspective.Here's my thinking (you did ask):Medical marijuana is here to stay in many countries and partially in the USA, under the heralded and accepted, state rights banner. That's a fact.  Many other countries allow and even fund research and have already developed drugs that doctors in those countries can prescribe as need be, similar to what Investor1954 talks about;  Israel, Australia, Germany, etc.  I see that list continuing to grow and I have no need to put a date on where, how much or when, since just accepting that it will grow at something similar to the speed it is growing right now, or faster, and that is enough to make money.Recreational MJ is legal in 9 states and DC and that's growing with legislation already on the books and awaiting the final touches in several states, like VT, MA, NJ, etc.   The biggest state, (and if it were a country, it would be sized as the 6th largest one), CA has already legalized it completely.  In my mind that will be a magnet for many other states and a role model to copy, thus hastening the arrival and usage of more MJ.  (Le rive gauche does set the standard in many instances.) Pres Trump is a business man and pragmatist. I anticipate/my premise is that he'll eventually bring the country's legal mechanisms around to allow us to compete in the global business that is swirling around this crop.  As a retired business man, I'm chagrined he hasn't done it already but his base supporters are proably more against it than he and he's one to keep his word. One catalyst that will hurry along his pramatism is if he begins to fall short on his GDP growth goals.  Given that, I'd be surprised if he doesn't make an acknowledging statement before the end of the year that may be in opposition to Señor Sessions.  If so we will have a terrific catalyst (but I'm not investing nor waiting for that to happen).  Risk is attached to and part of ANY investment and at this point, the risk spotlight is very focused on MJ stocks in the USA.  But that's not the case in other countries. In other countries, where federal law has caught or is catching up with the notion that this is a potentially beneficial crop (tax bonanza), MJ business will flourish due to pent up demand via recreational use and ongoing developments/usage in the medical arena.  So trying to pick my spots carefully, I have chosen to invest heartily in MJ stocks in Canada, carefully grabbed a few USA companies, like CRON, SNNVF and GBLX that are aware and shrewd enough to make money and not break any laws (no small accomplishment with a crop that in the past, all one could do to participate was break laws) and I will sit back and watch the my invesment grow.  At some point, valuations will and should have a bearing on what I invest in however, at this point, the rising tide is lifiting all the boats, good and bad and that is the risk I am now dealing with.  During this expected volatility phase, I'm attempting to use that volatiity to earn some income.  Hence, I watch for big spurts and then sell some of my initial purchases. Then on pullbacks, if they are deep enough, I buy some back. I try to learn the price movement of what I perceive to be winners so I can play this income game until valuations become the dominant factor in choosing between companies.  Once that happens (1-2 years?), I'll stop the income playing and sell any losers and continue holding any winners.Hope this helps and good luck in your investingmykie",
"Nasdaq listing will drive the share price. Canopy Growth is well managed and I also like how they are planning for the future. The Tobacco industry is nearly $800 billion worldwide, marijuana will become larger. In the West, the market will be around $300 billion.

In Canada the use of medical marijuana will skyrocket. It has little side affects compared to various pharmaceuticals.",
"Recently retired Michigan physician here.  I think medical marijuana in the US is a long ways off as is the opportunity for significant marijuana stock growth in the US.  We have legalized medical marijuana in our state but I never prescribed it for several reasons.1 - Licensing fears.  Physicians here have 3 state licenses: one to practice medicine, one to prescribe drugs and another to prescribed controlled substances.  We also need a federal DEA license for controlled substances.  These are renewed every 3 years. There is no way I would risk my DEA license in order to prescribe medical marijuana since it is still against federal law to use it.  There has not been any instances here of someone losing their DEA license for prescribing medical marijuana in Michigan...yet.  All we need is some zealous prosecutor wanting to make a name for himself.2 - Currently a sketchy business (""bad reputation"").  There is a physician ""Dr Bob"" who travels around the state and Skypes with patients giving certificates for medical marijuana.  This is not something most physicians want to be associated with.  It is prescribing a medication for a patient who you will likely not be seeing again and that's not a good or ethical way to practice medication.  That's like giving a diabetic insulin and never seeing him again.3 - Very little published, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled studies that support using medical marijuana.  How do we ""first, do no harm""?  We rely on scientific studies. ""Yes, but many medications make our patients sick or sometimes don't work for particular people"" which is true.  But if the drug has been vetted properly I know what the risks are..I know what to look for, who not to give it too or how to deal with the side effects.  I might advise a person to take a risky drug but for a life threatening condition; it might be worth it to him.  A physician who wants to do the best for his patient will rely on these studies and there are not many out there (http://bit.ly/2Dh68LR)4 - Big pharma has no way of making money on medical marijuana yet.  Since it is not truly legal, no one will research it.  If no one researches it, no one will make a product that doctors will prescribe.  Besides, I don't see how  you can put a patent on medical marijuana.  You would have to come up with a drug that can be made from it and get a patent on that unique substance.5 - It's a cash business.  Again this is due to it being legal for some states but against federal laws (http://on.freep.com/2G...)Your thoughts?  I've been recently watching marijuana stocks but mainly because of the impending Canadian law changes.",

"ISN'T THIS PARTIALLY LIKE A 'POISON PILL' TO AVOID TAKEOVER?Wynn Bondholders Poised to Benefit From TurmoilBY Dow Jones &amp; Company,— 8:00 AM ET 03/16/2018An obscure clause in a bond document is adding to Wynn Resorts Ltd.'s recent headaches.Wynn Resorts acquiesced to bondholder demands on Thursday, raising an offer to pay investors holding one of its notes due in 2023. The company is offering the payout because it needs bondholder consent to amend an unusual covenant in the bond that could hurt the company if founder Steve Wynn and his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, reduce their ownership stakes.The company is seeking to adjust a ""change-of-control"" covenant, that would be tripped if any investor came to own more voting shares than Mr. Wynn and Ms. Wynn hold between them, which currently amounts to a roughly 21% stake in the company.Mr. Wynn resigned as chairman and chief executive of Wynn Resorts last month following sexual-misconduct allegations against him detailed in a Wall Street Journal investigation. Recent developments in a separate legal case suggest he and Ms. Wynn may be looking to sell shares, making the terms of its bonds suddenly relevant. spokesman declined to comment on the reasons for the offering to bondholders. He also declined to say whether the company knows if Mr. Wynn plans to sell his shares. Contacted Thursday, a lawyer for Mr. Wynn said Mr. Wynn is declining to participate in any reporting by the Journal because he doesn't believe the newspaper will treat him fairly.Amending the bond is especially important for Wynn Resorts because the covenant in question also applies to two other bonds issued by its Wynn Las Vegas subsidiary as long as the 2023 bond remains outstanding. Violating the terms would mean that holders of all three bonds, which total more than $3 billion, could immediately demand repayment from Wynn at a premium of 101 cents on the dollar.The company is now offering holders a total of $25 million, or 5% of the bond's $500 million principal, to rewrite the terms so the covenant would only be breached if a person or entity assumed a majority ownership in the company. That is up from its initial offer of $10 million made last month, as well as a second offer that promised up to $25 million but guaranteed only $12.5 million.From the outset, some of the largest holders figured it didn't make sense to amend the 2023 bond for anything less than $25 million, according to two people familiar with the matter.That figure roughly reflects the extra cash that Wynn Resorts ( WYNN ) would need to pay holders if it were to redeem the 2023 bond ahead of schedule -- a step the company, if it didn't reach a deal, could ultimately be forced to take to avoid also repaying the two other Las Vegas bonds.In a sign that investors think a deal is likely, the 2023 bonds traded on Wednesday at 102.313 cents on the dollar, up from 98.625 cents at the start of February, according to MarketAxess.The tough negotiating by bond investors marks a notable shift from recent history, when Mr. Wynn openly delighted in the attractive terms he was able to extract from the debt market.In a 2013 conference call, Mr. Wynn referred to Matt Maddox, the company's then-chief financial officer and current CEO, as ""Dr. Maddox"" for the ""skilled surgery"" he had performed on the company's balance sheet.""",
"Jensan, that's great for LVS if they pull it off, but what is the benefit for WYNN shareholders to sell at this bargain basement price? We have all the potential future development you just mentioned.  Why sell now?  Wait a few years and I have a $300 stock on my hands.",
"SA and LVS, should make every endeavor to purchase control of Wynn. Yes, $11 Bn sounds like a great deal of monies, however the actual deal that I repeatedly propose costs as follows:The sale of three assets + $4 Bn to gain effective control of Wynn.Again those three assets are : 1 . Bethlehem Casino. 2. 49% of MBS Retail Mall 3. Sands Macao Casino. 4. $4 Bn Cash.In turn :  LVS gains 50.1% of Wynn Resorts          1. Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas          2.

Convention Center    $13 Bn in Cash and $ 7 Bn in Long Term Debt.Should LVS slightly overpay by $1 Bn or $2 Bn, imho, the middle and long term benefit would solidify control of the North Las Vegas Strip. Additional scenario is having an expansion of the Wynn Palace in Macau that could achieve $3 to 4 Bn in Revenue per annum, with almost $1.5 Bn in EBITDA, especially after the proposed expansion. Remember the Wynn Diamond was to be built there.Finally, the Wynn name overseas in Asia is to be maintained , a name that has the connotation of luxury plus success. Wynn's name is changed in USA for political expediency's sake.The cash monies that exist after the sale of the 3 Taipa casinos, provides the financial foundation for the next decade's growth. Management would be in place with the CEO of Wynn is responsible for all Las Vegas facilities and Boston and thus the company is the size of the present day Wynn Resorts - with an annual revenue  of $ 7 to 8 Billion.Goldstein overseas the company and Macau/Singapore group working with the regional Vice Presidents there, with Annual Revenue of $12 to 14 Billion. Similar to the present size of LVS.Stronger upper management is created.The companies control $15 Bn in Cash and $15 Bn in long term Debt by end of 2019 with an Ebitda of $7.4 Bn.  Annual Dividend costs are $3.2 Bn ( Wynn Dividends are eliminated). Annual Capex costs are $2.5 Bn including maintenance from 2019 to 2026. Net Interest Costs are zero, due to the savings from Economies of Scale of $300 MM per annum. Long Term debt Repayments are $1 Bn the first five years commencing 2019 increasing to an average $3.5 Billion in year 6-8 as EBITDA increases from the results of Newly completed Capex.When Japan, Boston Harbor, Wynn West and Paradise Park are completed, the latter three by 2020 and the projected increase of an additional $3.5 Bn of Ebitda occurs in 2024, than LTD Repayment increases.The additional building of an IR in Thailand or Vietnam and one casino in Brazil (prefer Cuba) will be the next period of growth for LVS.This is a great deal better than the $30 Bn spent for Spain/Europe that SA had presented a few years back.",
The share swap would require a 13D - that is based on % of ownership.  doesn't matter whether you pay cash or give other compensation for the shares.,
"I agree, but would a share swap between LVS and Wynn family shares require 13D, I believe SA buys up to 4.9% initially of Wynn Shares than the share swap and than the announcement of intent of purchase.",

Wynn Resorts Former CEO Steve Wynn May Sell 12% Stake,
"Jensan, I didn't say it WOULD happen only that I WISH it would go that way.  A hostile offer from SA would be more costly than a friendly one. There would be (as discussed) some possible anti-trust issues (at least in Macau).",
"SA buys Wynns shares and 5% of the shares of the Wynn Resorts, he than controls 17.4% versus 9% of Elaine your logic does not hold water. Elaine is worth $1.6 Bn and SA is worth $40 Bn, there is no contest.Elaine can maximize her shares, in either a share swap with LVS and than clip coupons of 20 MM shares at $3 a share = $60 MM per annum.If SA wants this company Elaine will have to find some partners with yugely deep pockets.",
"Having Elaine come aboard as a board member and keeping the company independent would be a great outcome, much better than falling into Sheldon's hands.  Steve's shares could be purchased and a note issued to pay them off over some period of time.",
"To many back seat drivers and noise from the peanut gallery...this makesmore sense.""It  is unclear what Ms. Wynn intends to do with her shares. Though she had fought for six years to get the shareholder agreement dissolved so she could have the right to sell them, she is now weighing a bunch of different options, including even the possibility of becoming more involved in the company given Mr. Wynn's departure, according to people familiar with her thinking"".",
"After reviewing the 2017 4th qtr statements of Wynn and Lvs, the revenues for the three Taipa properties annualized to $3.2 Bn Sales and an Ebitda of $1.05 Bn.  With 2018 projections indicating that the volume may increase by another 8-10%, thus $3.5 Bn in Revenue would provide an Ebitda of $1.2 Bn.Should this be the case in 2019, a sales could net LVS (should they purchase a controlling share of Wynn) $12 Bn. plus 40% of the Wynn Resort Long Term Debt and 5% of Long Long Term of LVS. The Long Term Debt would be reduced by $5.3 Bn.",

Howard, what do you believe will be the payout be including Long Term Debt absorption for these 3 properties plus the casino license. Wynn Palace would be placed under the Sands China license.My projections were that $8-10 Bn in Cash plus 4- 6 Bn in long term debt being absorbed by the new purchaser- possibly Genting or another Asian (Chinese gambling company).This would allow future expansion for LVS/Wynn or Sands Global Gambling with these funds from the China sale for : Japan, Vietnam and Brazil.What is your opinion Howard?",

"OK,,so entry point to buy WYNN shares ?",
"i have stated before that the room is not big enough for these two giant ego's...........both are brilliant.....i understand that they are business friends and wynn's problems,i just find it hard to believe that those two giants would become one........money does make strange bedfellows!!!!   although it would be very good for me!!",
"WYNN investors will be better off if WYNN stays independent.  It won't perform like the last two years, but it will greatly outperform the market.",
"Or 48% of the Newco, effective control of the company",
Than LVS has the ability to purchase the family’s share of 21.4% for $4.Bn and prior to that an additional $900 million for 5% of Wynn float. Thus LVS owns 26.4% of WynnShares and than the merger takes place.Wynn has 20% ownership of new Corp. and LVS owns the remainder.  LVS owns in total 426 MM of 500 MM shares.Should Wynn own 18% of Newco because of the excess amount of the Long Term Debt.LVS would own 416 MM shares of Newco and LVS would 26.4% of Wynn totaling 22 MM totaling 438 MM shares of the Newco.Thus SA and family own 240 MM,
Should LVS Retail Mall sale of 50% MBS,

"Howard, thanks so much for jumping on this news so quickly and providing your thoughts.Can you confirm that you see little risk of the 2 Wynns 20%+ in shares hitting the open market - therefore, pulling share price down due to sheer volume?  Additionally, I take it you feel that a merger with LVS (own shares too) would be a Wynn/win for both company’s shareholders?  That’s my assumption, and hope based on it.Thanks again.  Your calls have been spot on so far!",

It is so obvious that LVS is going to buy this.  I bet they are scrambling to sell the Singapore mall.  Will be very interesting to see it play out.  I assume they would have to spin off Wynn Macau.  The placement of LVS and WYNN properties on the strip couldn't be more perfectly situated to capitalize on an acquisition.,

"Wood pellets are a false energy solution. Here are the top reasons to run away from wood pellet mills investments - in my opinion.1. Not used in the US power plants2. The emissions and particulates from the moment a tree is cut down to the moment one wood pellet burns are worse than using coal. Also, the amount of energy used exceeds the amount of energy provided.3. The ""carbon neutral"" argument is false, an accounting error. The CO2 emissions from one tree burned in minutes do not equal the CO2 sequestered by a seedling as it grows in 20-30 years. 4.  With severe weather from the climate disruption, it is uncertain what will happen to new seedlings. We are living in new climate getting worse every day.5. The climate emergency is today. The CO2 sequestered by new trees will happen over 20-30 years. 6. This is similar to ignoring interest rates in a present value calculation.

Maybe some of you developing forests can come up with more aggressive plans to reforest at a faster clip? Then burn,burn burn. No problem as long as emissions are retreated.

"The Rest-On trial is ongoing but simply has been slightly delayed because of patient recruitment.  Narcolepsy is a rare disease and it is difficult to find treatment naive patients.  Read the trasncript of the cc carefully-enrollment continues and there is no reason to suspect that the product will not be brought to market.  The stock sell off reflects some disappointment at the slightly slower pace of the trials.  However, the pharmacokinetics show that the targets as to blood levels have been met.  Simply a matter of time.To be honest, it is difficult, indeed almost impossible,  for me to conceive that Jazz would allow FT 118 to be brought to market under the control of Avadel.  Virtually the entire Jazz franchise is in the Oxyborate space and Jazz controls the price of the drugs.  I believe that there is a very significant chance that Jazz will attempt to purchase Avadel-and relatively soon.  I am not certain, but once the Avadel product is brought to market the purchase of Avadel by Jazz might well be prevented as being anticompetitive. One can be reasonably  sure that the BOD at Jazz is up late wondering what to do, i.e., if and when to purchase Avadel.  Think carefully about the implications of the new FT 118 product on the future of Jazz and put such considerations in context.  If you were running Jazz and your revenues and control of a given market were entirely based the treatment of a single disease using a single product, would you allow another company to control your destiny?The Noctiva launch occurred significantly ahead of targets and as stated shipments have already started.  It is pretty obvious that initial use will be by Urologists.  However, one expects use of the drug to rapidly increase-especially in those settings in which falls are a major risk to seniors and those who are disabled, i.e., nursing homes, etc., etc. Once again, put the use of the drug in an easily understood context:  Your elderly father has to use the bathroom 3-4 times each evening.  He is becoming unsteady on his feet, and has already fallen several times while stumbling from his bed to the bathroom.  Noctiva is a drug that is  affordable, and will decrease the risk of such falls and in so doing will prevent serious injury and perhaps death. The cost of hospitalization and replacement of a broken hip would cost thousands of dollars, and the use of the drug several hundred dollars a year. What would you recommend your Dad do-take the drug or risk the fall?Although the last few months have been disappointing to those who own Avadel stock, the company appears to be well managed by experienced individuals with years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry.",

Where did you get the information from for 1999, and how did you select which analyst estimates to use to establish that the forward PE was less than 25?",

"Hi Zack,Thank you for your always informative daily column. I consider it a must read, as do so many biotech traders.The recent price action of Aimmune has been disappointing for those of us who understand the very bullish case for this company that will most likely be able to deliver a very efficacious treatment for a currently unmet medical need. I recently wrote a SA article so stating after the stock plummeted following the excellent PALISADES data (https://seekingalpha.c... ).There have been various theories put forth as to why the stock is meeting headwinds at a time when investors should feel more confident in AIMT's prospects for success. There is little question that the timing of the secondary announcement so soon after the PALISADES data caught traders off-guard. And many -including me- think word of the secondary leaked a full trading day before the actual announcement, giving many broker dealers a chance to sell in advance of the news. Some feel that the fall in the stock is simple profit taking on good news. Others insist that DBVT will have a serious competitor with their Viaskin patch. But the PALISADES data is so compelling that the DBVT issue really does not hold water. Most rational minds understand that Aimmune will have a best in class treatment and will be able to garner significant market share, perhaps as high as 80% relative to the patch.The above issues have been mulled and talked about ad nauseam.  But I believe a seldom addressed issue is really now responsible for holding AIMT in check: the potential threat to Aimmune's desensitization approach by Anaptys Bio's monoclonal antibody ANB020 and it's future application in peanut allergies (2a trial data to be released at any time). There is so little discussion here and so much opacity surrounding whether this is a threat or not, that it has the investment community on edge. I was hoping you could shed some light on this subject. If I had been at the recent Aimmune question and answer session at the 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology-World Allergy Organization Joint Congress, this is the one question I would have asked the very engaging CEO Steve Dilly. I am disappointed no one brought it up.Questions left unanswered include:1) What is the realistic timing of an approval of ANB020 for peanut allergy? I have read that  peak sales would not be achieved until 2027. What does that imply? Even if ANB020 is efficacious, how far behind Aimmune are they?  2) I have read arcane research papers -very dry and difficult to understand if you are not a scientist- that claim that some research suggests that an IL-33 antibody could raise the risk of metastesis in gastric and colorectal cancers.3) Is the above a reason why Anaptys is targeting adults and not children, two seperate populations?4) What is the safety differential in desensitization vs. injectable biologics?5) Will ANB020 be a stand alone product, or would it be used in conjunction with Aimmune's AR101 very much like Sanofi/Regeneron is hoping to do with Dupixent/AR101? There are many unanswered questions. I could go on. But answering some of them would go a long way to clarifying a difficult to understand issue.I believe the new data that was revealed regarding PALISADES at the Orlando conference was so incredible that Aimmune  will not only lead in this field for years to come, but clearly the company is a ripe target for takeover. One new piece of data that no one is yet talking about is the new slide that Mr. Dilly revealed that shows that the same 85% desensitization rate that applies to the 4-17  year olds also holds for 18 -55 year olds, essentially doubling their potential patient population! Zack, if you can illuminate some of the darkness surrounding the issues I have brought up it would be greatly appreciated.Best wishes to you,Keith","3 Things In Biotech, March 7: Aimmune Scores, Bristol-Myers Compresses, Dermira Bombs"

I really wouldn't discount Disney or a bunch of other old media players as well, streaming technology has been around for awhile (hi Youtube) and replicating Netflix's model is not that difficult.Also, not quite analogous but it's like shareholders being happy that Apple invests a ton of money (70% of their revenue) in making a ton of iPhone Xs then sells them at $400 instead of $1000, just so they can sell it to more people. They might have a lot of customers but they're still generating a loss! Talk about expensive bubbles in bull markets.When valuations start to matter in bear markets, Netflix probably has a fair valuation of <$150 a share based on fundamentals like actual EARNINGS, which would put them around Time Warner's market cap.",
"No one is disputing Netflix as a product. However regarding the stock, it is clear that with a negative FCF over the next three years, valuations that exceed any reasonable multiples -even by taking the growth into consideration -, Netflix is way too expensive. Momentum players are buying but as soon as the market will end the bull market and probably this year, the move back to 200 will be painful. Enjoy the ride while it lasts.",
"The Disney threat has yet to materialize. Even if it's a serious threat (a combo ESPN/Disney/Hulu package for $12/month, global), it won't kill Netflix. Will help kill off anyone below a very lofty tier though.",
"Lots of resistance, on chart, to further climb...retrench to 300 an almost certainty.  Then maybe lower, if FED raised rates late this month.  IMHO.",
"The real challenge is it's not just Disney, and also I have watched most the content on Netflix and sure they have some decent show and movies but not enough to keep people interested. Most shows and movies have bad acting and are low budget to the point you can't watch them. 50 percent of the US having a Netflix account doesn't make any sense that's would mean their are 150+million subscribers. I have been surveying tons of people about Netflix in the US and they say they are all canceling it now because of the price increase mixed with the lack of good content. They watch the good shows then cancel. On top of that Subscriber growth includes free trial accounts and I know people who make fake emails just to use Netflix for free. Netflix can't catch up with it Competitors because it litterally is trying to compete against people who specialize in different subjects. For example there has never been a better kid movie maker in history than Disney. What people aren't pointing out is the deregulation Trump put into affect. Now every Tv Channel is starting their own online streaming service with much higher quality content. Not only that but each channel is more focused on a subject and puts out a faster stream of content. Netflix has a wide range of content but people don't like a wide range of shows so once they can't find something in their taste and believe me it doesn take very long, I've been a very loyal customer of Netflix for years and use to own their stock, people are sick of the sub par content. The networks all are taking their shows off of Netflix so saying Netflix is doing the Netflix originals as some kind of ""legendary buisness stradegy"" as some people say is entirely incorrect. They don't have a choice and now that that's happening they are NO LONG A TECH COMPANY THEY ARE JUST A MEDIA/ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY all the supports for Netflix are opinions people got from Wall street, or Californian Investors and they both have always been corrupt for years. Learn US current events and stop being so out of touch with the world. I know a 12 year old that knows better than to buy or hold Netflix stock over a 100 billion dollar market cap. Look at their trading volume chart in the last decade. Even their own CEO Reed Hastings was warning people years ago when the stock first started rapidly inflating. Now he has so much money and already publiccaly warned people years ago he doesn't care anymore. He sold Most his shares years ago. Don't buy into the the Hype it's just a tech bubble Netflix has been riding the success of Amazon and google being grouped together in the FAANG stock. Stop depending on random media articles you found on Google to get your information. By the way not that Netflix is becoming a media/entertainment company that's means wall strreets evaluation any day could drop by 1000% because if entertainment companies got paid 10x revenue Disney would be worth over a trillion dollars keep in mind they also makes video games, toys, and more. Netflix doesn't have the buying power to make amusement parks and toys as well as keep up with putting on new content. DO NOT LET THE HYPE TRICK YOU THE MEDIA HAS BEEN TRYING TO SELL THIS SAME NARRITIVE FOR YEARS.",
"Netflix is right to move to produce their own content. And they are making good content. The rest of the model isn't so good.

Another piece of evidence that perhaps suggests how far the technology has developed in recent years.Building off some of the discussion from part 1, this is what I like about Sangamo versus CRISPR in the near term.  We are discussing an exciting technology that has already been used in ~10 patients (I may be off, just a quick scan of the old phase 2 info from 2015) and shown no serious adverse events and some efficacy.Also want to speculate a bit...  There has been a lot of discussion of the high price tag of the recently approved car-t therapies that revolves around the economics of a patient's care (possibility of an expensive 'cure' with cell therapy vs. long term costs of the current standard of care).  I wonder if another factor is that the economics didn't add up on Sangamo's earlier HIV therapy that aimed for functional control, compared to the possibility now of eradication with an improved version.",

The two most likely outcomes are both positive in my opinion.  1)  A company such as JAZZ pays $35-40 within the next six months.2)  The stock inches up slowly and then starts to run mid to late summer as the two big catalysts in fall and spring get closer.,
GLYC seem very cheap here relative to their prospects of peak sales and the phase 2 data. Reminds me of the market cap difference between RXDX and LOXO after RXDX phase 2 before it was acquired.  (the diff between GLYC and Where Celator was acquired seems like a similar anomaly),

"TreyT,I have a splendid idea.  Let's wait around for 2025 and see what unfolds.  If I was wrong, you can tell me... I TOLD YOU SO.  However, I have a pretty good knowledge that the Bakken and Eagle Ford are already dead.  While production is supposedly increasing in these two shale fields, most of the companies MUST DRILL & PRODUCE OIL or they will not be able to service their debt.  Thus, Bakken & Eagle Ford oil production is not being done for good economics, but rather, because these companies are forced to drill and produce oil at barely breakeven or a loss.The Permian is the last shale oil field with a decent amount of reserves, but it won't last long.  I see U.S. shale oil production falling from 5+ mbd to below 1 mbd within the next 8 years.",
"Where's your evidence production will collapse in 8 years?  That's possible but that would require industry laying down the vast majority of their rigs..When rigs get laid down and production falls despite rising global demand what do you think happens to prices?  They GO UP prompting investment...While we could certainly see a pull back if the market crashes or we go into recession, you seem to be ignoring fundamentals of how markets work in order to reach your preferred conclusion of shale production and prices collapsing, as if in a vacuum...As for shale producers not making any money, across the industry as a whole?  I can't really dispute that, full cycle returns in this business have always been very tough, even before shale.  You're selling a commodity that you produce but have no control over what it sells for.  I also agree with you (at least I think you agree with this) that lower or no debt is generally better, especially in this business, but it's also somewhat unrealistic given what history has shown.  We can agree that we'd both like to see debt in the sector paid down substantially...will that happen I don't know?  Will US oil production fall back to 5 million bpd by 2025?  Seems unlikely...",
"TreyT,I have been following the U.S. Shale Oil Industry for nearly a decade, ever since the Barnett Shale Gas Field took off in 2007.  While the U.S. Shale Energy Industry has brought on quite a bit of oil and gas production, the industry as a whole hasn't made any money.To produce this low EROI, high-cost shale oil and gas, the bag holders became the investor.  The U.S. Shale Oil Industry has racked up over $220 billion in debt.  Unfortunately, the shale oil companies cannot pay back their debt, so they issue new debt to pay back old debt... just like Continental did with its new $1 billion in Senior Notes.  When a company continues to borrow more money to pay back old debt, then we have a typical PONZI SCHEME in the making.The U.S. Shale Energy Industry will leave a trail of tears as production collapses when investors realize they will not get their money back.  I forecast U.S. oil production to decline back below 5 mbd by 2025, maybe much sooner.Lastly, watch for shale energy companies to start going belly-up when the oil price falls back towards $40 and possibly $30 during the next market crash-correction over the next two years.",
"The likelihood of CLR paying down 10%-20% of its debt is NIL.  Continental Resources is the Poster Child of what's wrong with the U.S. Shale Oil Industry.  Even though U.S. oil production has doubled in the past 8 years, due to shale, it will collapse just as quickly..... probably even faster than 8 years.Anyone investing in most shale oil companies... you have my sympathies.",
"CLR is a solid outfit, they've done a good job managing through the downturn in my estimation.  Their fiscal discipline and reduction of debt should continue.  Debt is going to become more expensive the next year or two and with Wall Street actually asking for discipline out of the energy space it will require some adjustment across the sector.  I would hope that CLR will pay down the debt over the next several years to be well less than their 5B target.",
"I approve of paying down the debt.  We could have another downturn and the company needs some protection as a going concern.Don't like the talk about hedging oil though.  Rather have them exposed to up/down side by being unhedged but with some protection by not having much debt.  Think that is right balance of risk.  Also, I just don't like the attitude of thinking they can guess the oil price and know when to hedge/unhedge.  Just pick a strategy and stick with it (I prefer unhedged).Overall good work.  Very solid information gained on the STACK and Bakken.  It is a small shame the situation with STACK having a bit less runway than some hoped.  But it is what it is and better for them to analyze it and then share it.  It's still good acreage.  Just not as stunning in terms of infills as originally hoped.Looking forward to continued development of Bakken and Springer.

"This comment focuses on the OVERSUPPLY ISSUE facing lithium.  On Feb 20 BMO published a 120-page study of lithium, cobalt and nickel in which they wrote (this is lifted directly from the report):“Lithium demand is growing at a fast pace as the EV transition accelerates, but asignificant supply response looms, likely overwhelming the large (but not as large) demand growth trajectory by 2019.  We still expect realized lithium prices to trade up some more in 2018, averaging ~$14k/t LCE (lithium carbonate equivalent) versus spot ~$13-14k/t, before starting to fall back in 2019 and stabilizing at ~$10k/t.  A surplus of supply over demand of 58 thousand tonnes is projected for this year followed by 109 KT in 2019.”The author states that he has witnessed declines in lithium company share prices due to oversupply fears on several occasions in the past, and that on each occasion (mid 2016, early 2017), the market came to realize that there was no oversupply issue.We will see.

I was on that ALB conference call the morning after they put out great earnings. ALB laid out how they are approaching supply/demand; by modularizing production plants construction. to paraphrase an ALB executive --we'll build 5 smaller plants based on demand rather than 1 megaplant--. And then there are the car manufacturers and battery produces that don't all use the same formation of Li for their EV battery needs. Special chemical processes are required and that all takes lots of times; for this reason manufacturers are putting in their orders for Lithium for years down the road.

"two thoughts:1.  Lithium supply response to increased demand is quite elastic (relative to other minerals) and there is a vast amount of this not-rare mineral. Bringing a Li mine and processing facilities into production is far simpler with much lower cap costs than almost any other type of mine such as hard rock mines. Existing mines and facilities can increase production faster than any other mineral, except maybe salt. Don't count on a supply-storage driven price increase for lithium.2. lithium chemistry batteries are a terrible fit for energy storage. Don't count on that usage. Why is Tesla's storage divisions such a terrible failure on revenue, for years. The only thing they can tout is ONE Australian demo.  Alternate chemistries are far more suitable and cost effective such as vanadium flow batteries http://bit.ly/2G6Zr2b  If you want to bet on EV driven shortages, forget about Lithium. look at Cobalt, which has huge supply risk with ~70% of cobalt supply being impinged by the kleptocrats in the DRC.  Nearly all cobalt production is a by-product (copper/nickel mines for eg), It's hard to find a pure-play of any size to respond to more attractive Co prices.  Look at Ardea Resources in Australia. Read the many articles on the 'cobalt cliff' on Seeking Alpha.  Note that the research to reduce cobalt ratio in Li Co batteries is severely limited by physics - the less cobalt you use the lower the stability of the battery - battery fires are a bad thing, ask Boeing (787 fires) and laptop makers.",

Energy storage installations are expected to rise 100% in the US in 2018 vs 2017.  By the end of 2018, no major solar RFP will be without a storage component.  Gas fired peaker plants are now no longer economic vs energy storage.  It has been the relentless decline in battery costs that has made them economic in the last year, and it will continue to decline in cost to make the case of storage even more economically compelling.",

Leaving aside the massive discrepancy in valuations, I would be very surprised if Viking *only* produces similar data in its Phase II study.",

Very hard to find anything of quality and lots of really low quality content. At this point this is absolutely no competition to cable or satellite TV. I really hope they add more and better content.",
"I agree that the recent price surge has been impressive, but if you look at the history of stellar stocks (e.g., Microsoft and Intel in the 90s, or more recently the other FAANG stocks) the gains are seldom linear. That's why it's next to impossible to time such ""wild horses"" as they are prone to making sudden moves that will leave you behind and unable to justify re-entry. Much better to ignore the stock price and wait until there is some sort of fundamental shift in either the overall market or the fundamental secular trend that is driving the stock. That being said, this is a reasonable analysis but misses an important point, and that is in guesstimating the ""Number of Internet Households"". This is set to rise exponentially over the next five years with the roll out of 5G networks, which will provide fixed and mobile broadband anywhere you can get a cell signal today. Thus the mobile phone penetration rate (see http://bit.ly/2D7QemV) is a better gauge of addressable market size. It currently sits at over 65% of the global population, and this number is itself still growing. Since global population was estimated at 7.6 billion as of December 2017, that translates to roughly 5 billion mobile phone users today on a global basis. This is why I believe NFLX will reach the 1 billion subscriber mark within 10 years, and do so surprisingly comfortably.This is due to both the dramatic increase in the number of ""Internet households"" that can be expected during this period as well as the death of linear television as everything moves to streaming. Ironically, the more successful DIS is with their streaming service due to launch next year the more this will help NFLX by accelerating the demise of linear TV. With literally no place else to go, the rush to streaming will become a global stampede, and NFLX has positioned itself to be the main beneficiary of this secular trend.The old adage, ""Watch the calendar, not the clock"" has seldom been more applicable than to NFLX.",

They introduce the idea in the article that they might sell this tech to other studios. I don't find that likely, but would be an interesting new revenue line.",

I'm short Netflix especially since you need internet to use it and the cable companies all charge large amounts for internet if it's not bundled. As well as all entertainment shifting to the internet....this stock isn't a tech stock....It's an entertainment stock now...it use to be a tech stock until they had to start making their own content and other companies started streaming services....don't get me wrong Netflix is good buisness just the market cap should not be anywhere near Disney or Comcast.

With amazon heading towards 2000 a share the netflix share price will continue on an upward trend for some time to come, possibly to 500 by the end of the year.",
"Netflix operates in a VERY narrow space, unlike the other tech companies which have their hands in everything. Netflix is also going 'all-in' regarding original content, meaning they are anticipating competition in the near future and are trying to cement themselves for the long term. If their original content is good enough (i.e. Stranger Things, Orange Is The New Black, House of Cards, etc.) they will own the licensing rights, meaning an additional future source of income. Disney has lately been seen as the closest 'potential' competitor to Netflix with content like Star Wars, Marvel, etc., but because Disney isn't indicating an 'all-in' approach, no one is betting the bank on them. This leads me to believe that Netflix will continue to dominate this space for years to come. Now if you start to assume a buyout by a company like Apple, then the recent market surge gets more interesting.",

These drugs are patented and approved by law,Teva provided all the required information, and according to what was said, it should not give information beyond what was required,There are rules that are medical confidentiality in companies and it is written in the rules of law,On this nature company insisted on its right and.The court also acquitted the company of this right,The fact that there are non-market marketers operating on the black market.This is not the problem of the companies, but of the legal authorities,You know what's going on in the drug market.Do you know what happens to a person who is addicted to the drug, to any medicine?Forgive me all your negative articles about a natural company. And I see Teva going forward Slowly but forward in the way of success,There is also a lot of politics here and a lot of noise, every politician and his voters,It has been going on for decades,Why did they suddenly remember? Where have they been until now?You deal with accounting and parameters that are not true about Teva, for example, the debt is now down to $ 32.4 billion within two years,Teva stands well in debt service.And there is already an agreement with the debt holders and the banks,Teva's bond issue is over-demand and will be successful. Over-demand is required.There is a new general manager Schultz. A new person who understands good in the field of pharma and understands good in international trading,He is also a skilled and experienced financier,With the new efficiency plan and Teva's new drug pipeline of around 600, 100 for immediate approval, Teva is on the right track,Are you speaking from a position or a courier of some competing company? ..It's transparent.Stick to the facts and verify.I also write articles but only on professional parameters and tell the truth.With proper disclosure, I am not invested in Teva,But think it's now a buying opportunity.Warren Buffett bought at $ 18.95 and I think he will increase his holdings in nature.A subsidiary of Bill Cross, a hedge fund company, has raised holdings from 6.7 percent in Teva to 12 percent.So what are you smarter than them? ..They know everything about Teva as shareholders.Teva buys these prices,Write it down in front of you and you can also take a picture of it - Teva within three years, $ 60. This is in a net accounting calculation.My dear friend, I will give you enough advice with the articles that do not add to your respect.And your articles repeat themselves with the parameters of two years ago.Go on and speak the truth and present real facts.And not just an address that does not correspond to reality now..

"I'll admit that I haven't considered TEVA's various legal problems as significant threats to TEVA's bottom line. This exploding death toll from opioids is getting hard to ignore. With deaths every year now exceeding the USA losses in the entirety of the Vietnam War and increasing by 30% per year, somebody has to pay, whether fair to TEVA and the other companies or not.

"It is difficult to decipher political people and their attitude. Some are sincere. Some like to grandstand and do have an anti-commercial bias that says if an outfit is big it must be bad. They may believe this inside or not, if it seems like good politics. Teva sells a lot of the generic drugs used here. They are an easy target, whether they deserve to be or not. I have no idea about whether they would push opiates where they are not necessary. I am a stockholder. In my mind, that makes me just a bit responsible for their actions. That said, I do not know how to exercise my responsibility to get them to do what is best for patients.Opiates are legal and can do people well for a limited time. I have pain issues from nerve damage. I resisted taking mild forms of opiates for a few weeks and finally needed to do so. After 2 more weeks, I realized my pain would be long term and opiates could only be used for a short time. We are a medical marijuana state, so I acquired a license with the help of my doc. It is now 3 years later; I remain on a small dose of MJ and CBD in order to sleep at night. No signs of addiction or need to increase the dose, but what I take is not covered by insurance as are opiates.The insane part is that Fed policy prevents any real medical research into MJ as to benefits and proper dosage. I had to learn that on the street and cannot really be sure of purity and concentration. That said, I am confident that MJ would be at least a partial solution to our runaway opiate crisis. Teva should be selling safe MJ products instead of opiates in many cases.",

Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the GOP chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, has refused to sign off on a subpoena to compel Teva’s compliance.Johnson said Teva had made a “good-faith effort” to answer McCaskill’s questions. In a January letter to McCaskill, Johnson noted that Teva officials held an informal briefing with McCaskill’s staff to detail its oversight of opioid shipments and diversion prevention efforts. The company also sent McCaskill two letters providing her with general information about its system for identifying and reporting potentially suspicious orders.“Teva appears to have spent significant time and resources seeking to address the issues you raised,” Johnson wrote in January, explaining his decision not to approve a subpoena.Guess Shock Exchange missed this?",

I mean, this is a furniture business, not NVDA...Finally, it's important to note that RH earnings are traditionally accelerating along the year, Q4 is the period with the strongest results and Q1 is the period with the weakest results.

The store in Scottsdale is 3 levels -- 3 levels is a pain.  Much like a shopping mall, the top level probably doesn't get nearly the traffic that the first level does.They are down to two distribution centers.  Sounds good, but I feel like this is going to hurt their ability to fill orders.  One very minor item there -- my sister was here from London and wanted pulls that they had on their website for her cabinets.  6 week lead time, she went home without the pulls.Me, I used to visit RH in their older single floor location at least once a year and eye that $6,000 leather couch that I should buy for my house.  Now know where the store is, but it's at the end of the mall, on the way to nothing, too far off of the street, and on 3 levels.I also note that the ""Member"" program used to be $399.  Now it is $100 and there seem to be promos to perhaps get it lower under certain conditions.  It strikes me as a bit of a race to the bottom, but then again -- housing is moving up.  So, people are spending.  And some of that is going to make it to RH.I continue to swim upstream.  Still short RH.

Good question.  My view is that there is a lot of trading activity done by quant systems and given the results posted by giant Walmart were not impressive there would be a knee jerk reaction to sell.

Amazon is now expanding into India which is a very tough market to make money.  I wish them luck and I do buy product from them from time to time but it’s stock is overvalued.  It is a good thing it is challenging the grocery sector which makes companies like Kroger pull up their socks and be more agile and productive. They know the industry and have a loyal client base.  At the end of it the customer is king.  I would like them to reduce their debt though.  The stock had a nice run up and is still as per calculations undervalued.  Hope the earnings tomorrow make it worthwhile. I have skin in the game. Long KR,

Significant performance gains.10b TAM for premium desktops and 10b for notebooks (this was not there last year)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...My projections for Q1,Q2(guidance) for 2018 based on above and projecting from previous Qtrs Q4 C&G Revenue was 958b and 17% up QoQ. It will increase at least 25% in Q1 2018 (because of new products like Ryzen Mobile, APU). Revenue from C&G Q1 2018 = $1197.5m Q1 2017 EESC Revenue was 391m up 5% YoY. It will be up 10% YoY because of EPYC. So Q1 EESC Revenue=430.1bSo total Revenue for Q1 2018 is 1197.5 + 430.1=$1627.10 (Management guided 1550m +-50m so it matches)This gives  Q1 revenue on the higher end.Now Q2 2018  Guidance will be 1197*1.30 + 430 * 1.15= $2050m (EPYC Ramp up will increase, Ryzen Mobile Rampup will increase, 12nm products will be in market)From seasonality argument in my earlier comment I had revenue stream as1.55b, 1.922b, 2.575b, $2.34b.

So  will use max pe=50 for 2018.In 2018 if we get eps=0.57(best case)  then the price will be between $17.1 and $28.5 (pe=30,50)In 2018 if we get eps=0.35(worst case)  then the price will be between $10.5 and $17.5 (pe=30,50)Averaging above we get (17.1 + 28.5 + 10.5 + 17.5) /4.0 = $18.4So we can expect AMD Stock Price by end of 2018 at around $18.4.I have used pe range of 30 to 50 for 2018. However if EPYC growth is >=10%, C&G Growth>=50%, Revenue >=$8400m, Revenue Growth >=40% then the pe will be around 100 as it was in 2005 when AMD started doing very well.

adaveinuswhat is the strike price and date for the AMD employees options.  Very interesting.,
http://bit.ly/2twiDDC,
"From Yahoo, Financial Analysts have revenue forecast of only $6.28b which if we divide equally comes to only $1.57b. AMD Management guided 1st Qtr as $1.55b. So basically Analysts just multiplied AMD guidance of 1st Qtr 2018 with 4 to get the annual revenue. This is why we see AMD Stock price at $11.70. If we consider seasonality, as last year, then the revenues will be as follows 1.55b, 1.922b, 2.575b, $2.34b. The annual revenue then comes to around $8.38b. If we get revenue greater than $8b then eps will be greater than $0.57 and AMD stock price greater than $17. AMD Management needs to convince that this is the case. Unfortunately we have no anecdotal evidence that revenues will come greater than $8.38 as we have not heard about new hyperscale customers or evidence about OEM sales. AMD Management has been bad for investors and to their employees.(options they receive are expiring worthless). Lisa Su continues getting salary greater than $11b which is almost equivalent to salary of Intel CEO. And now AMD Management wants our votes to dilute shares by another 50%. The reason is they dont want hostile takeover. I am not voting for it. I want AMD to be taken over by force or not and I dont care as current Management is powerless to help increase share holder value.https://yhoo.it/2oOqdDxhttp://bit.ly/2tAzV2G",

"“Over the past 20-plus years, the market’s average price-to-earnings/growth (PEG) ratio has been roughly 1.25.

"AMD doesn't need any more funding at shareholder expense. For any reason. They have the products NOW to compete successfully. If they ever need more fab space, they can always get it by throttling back R3 production, and anything else that has low margin.

AMD needs to return to the real world and stop conceiving business plans based on free handouts.That being said, as long as this insane open ended dilution is shot down, trading ranges can be a good thing. Of course, a trader with a longer time horizon would call them a CONSOLIDATION. Also a good thing. The only thing needed to break to the upside out of a consolidation is profits. They're coming. Possibly as early as Q2. At this point, it seems that a good time to buy would be in the $11 range. Like where we just entered again.Of course, if the dilution is approved, even if it isn't exercised any time soon, all bets are off. AMD has had enough free shareholder money to be able to succeed on their own. If approved, I won't touch this stock above $6.

"My take on AMD wanting to increase the number of shares.  In the past AMD survived by issuing warrants.  Now AMD is making a profit.  AMD has some top line products to produce and sell.  AMD needs Fabs to make the chips.  AMD looks to be a growing company with a possibly bright future.  AMD has to compete with INTC in the server market, NVDA in the GPU market and even with TXN in the SoC market.  Do You want to own a company like GE which is going to have to shrink to survive, or do you want to own a company that is going to grow?  Companies grow by increasing revenues which usually require more production which usually requires more investment in infrastructure.  Do I think AMD wants to get back into the FAB business no I don't.  Do I think AMD would want to have GoFo build a second 7nm production facility to meet future demand?  Sure I do if the demands is there.  Do I want AMD to have the freedom to make that decision right away rather than miss the opportunity because they are cash strapped?  In other words do we TRUST  the AMD management to get it right?  Sure do! Let AMD have the ability to GROW!  That will kill the short sellers faster than any dilution in the # of stock shares!",

Then there are guys who have been burnt in the past by AMD. AMD was in the verge of bankruptcy. Many Market Participants have that memory fresh in their mind and therefore feel its safe to SHORT this stock. These guys are traders and most active and working off past memory and technicals.Shorts are playing with fire. They are picking pennies in front of steam roller.

This is the Vendors playbook particularly DELL.Customers who want High End AMD products will source it from other online suppliers who customize their products and ODMs. Because of the above dynamics AMD Revenue Growth will grow steadily but not exponentially.

All this is speculation... including your EPS lag. I definitely don’t agree with the lag. GAAP earnings and margins will start to accelerate with the expansion of their products into different sectors. And EPYC is going to play a huge roll. There is something going on behind the scenes. Do some research... AMD might be in talks for a possible huge deal with another Big Comp to produce a massive amounts of chips. Is this a merger hhhmmm probably not or could be but it’ll have a HUGE impact on revenues Ect! If it is a merger well bless AMD and their shareholders. That short squeeze can be fun to watch,

"Xilinx?  Really...  No one is buying AMD would mean a costly battle with Intel and NVDA.

"Get a grip here.-  AMD is diluting shares with an additional 50%, which will really screw shareholders, and the stock price will drop a huge amount.- GS & others used MU's huge gains of the last few days as a reason to then spread a baseless rumor about a takeover, to run the stock up, and get obscene volumes of Calls to be bought to expire on March. 9-  The Weds. Call volumes tell it all:  27,640 Mar. 9 $12C,   18,249 of 12.50C.  17,708 of $13C.-  What do you think their game plan is?  They shorted the h*ll out of the stock after pushing the price up.  Then, Thursday they may continue this, but by Friday, they will make certain the stock price drops below $12 so all the $12's, $12.50's, & $13's will expire worthless.  GS & other shorts will have sold tons of these Calls, which will net them billions.  This will then cause a further drop in the stock price, and they will use their black boxes to cover the shorts they put on today (Weds.) , and they do it in dark pools and in careful algorithmic methods that blend in with the day's trading, so as to not make the price of the stock rise.Thanks, Lisa Su for your selfish, underhanded, screwjob on we, your shareholders.  She doesn't care about shareholders; only about how many shares she can flood the market with, as this brings in a ton of money to AMD, while she has violated all fiduciary responsibility.A class-action lawsuit of epic proportion should be taken by the law firms that are already suing AMD for small fish, when this big, stinking carp is what they should be going after.",
"The rise in AMD stock early on was attributed to leaked processor speed  @ 4.35 GHz and a possible take over price war.  Neither scenario explained the Friday to Tuesday short.  Buying protection on a really large investment makes a whole lot more sense.  I know that the techies out theree love the idea of AMD hitting 4.35 GHz speed but they just don't have the cash to be buying 850+ blocks of AMD in 30 minutes.  Some one that is going to make an offer to buy a company would be buying calls @$12, $13 and @$14 if they were going to offer $14.50.  IMHO neither the speed nor the black/white knight scenario make any sense at all!",
"Friday there is HUGE volume in AMD shorts @ $10, @11 and 1/2 the interest at those two levels @$12.  Fear is some one is getting ready to dump loads of AMD stock and reap profits from these short position puts.  Volume continues on Monday and Tuesday.  Scenario now changes from a BEAR run to a bull run because this kind of action occurs when a LARGE investment in a company is going to be made.  This morning around 10:30 eastern AMD had a HUGE spike in VOLUME.  From what i could see AMD was trading approximately 2 million shares per minute for 30 minutes.  My broker looked found out AMD had over 850 BLOCK trades.  Now that they own all these shares and all these puts I expect to see some massive calls hitting the market.  The traders who have been manipulating AMD may want to find a fox hole as a new player has entered the arena.  Still trying to figure out if I should buy back my $14 April covered calls (my speculative position) or sell my core position.

Think about this very carefully because it is at the crux of why there is no one out there capable of buying AMD, It's more than just IP. Even if Intel could they would be clueless! The same question could be asked about Intel or NVidia.To think another company would buy AMD intact as a separate wing wouldn't work either, why would the board or shareholders agree to that?

AMD had been highly manipulated for long time. No wonder if you see AMD trading back at 11sh tomorrow. Don’t know if it is short squeeze or trap.,
this has been a rumor forever. in past it was found that AMD x-86 in non transferable from intel. so any sale would loss the that license. Is this still true?,
"No no and No, yes they are a target for an aggressive company that sees the growth and plays in servers. Crypto no, Apple no (can internally develo whatever they need.) XLNX...mmm nah. Nvidia because of slowing growth, plays in the space know the company and can take on x86 and make a big splash in servers and obviously use the GPU IP and deals and licences and revenues and wins. They have enough stock equity to make up for cash. Safe bet to stay with american company's that can expand into or already in the server space or private equity firm.",

Amd appears to be a traders play ground. It has been trading within a range.  Rumours like this one is not surprised. AMD is a growth story but new products will need time to gain acceptance.  I tend to agree with Chris that the benefit of eypc may take time so EPs may remain low for next 1 to 3 years.,
"Chris and Community - I've held AMD for a few years now and always wondered why analysts were so (sometimes extremely) down in the mouth about the company. I had some suspicions around competitors (or large brokerage houses) pumping the financial press for bad news... but recently Cramer mentioned in a Street interview about a possible ""group effort"" (for lack of a better term)to keep AMD down and one that might be worthy of investigation. Thoughts on that?",
Why not Samsung?,
"AMD has a lot going for it. Crypto is not going anywhere, Proof of Work (PoW) is not going anywhere (PoW is what requires GPUs, is the backbone of the currencies security, Proof of Stake {PoS} most likely will lead to more inequality).

"Chris, you failed to mention the two most likely suitors for AMD: Micron and Samsung.",
"AMD (which many have pointed out is being manipulated) is nothing more than a trading stock, been doing it for a while with great success (takes patience) - Buy near $10-11 and sell near $14-15. Repeat. Fundamentals, industry catalysts, crypto dreams, etc. don't matter here. If you want a solid name to hold long-term, buy INTC or NVDA. Cheers!",
"Chris, my skepticism began with your early point about investors getting “trapped into holding AMD at higher prices”, due to rumors of a buyout that only are used to pump the stock. My skepticism was confirmed as I read, but I was blown away at the end: after trashing AMD as a trade and discounting any possibility of a buyout, you “may initiate a position within 72 hours”.  Ok.I’ll limit quibbling to a couple points. You point out that AMD profit growth will lag revenue growth. Your reason is that Ryzen ramp takes cash. My own thought is that AMD is investing in the ramp of new products on 12 nm and 7 nm modes, not on ramp of current Ryzen. And this use of capital ensures future profit growth. You also point out that AMD profit ramp is 1 to 5 years away, but later you say that EPYC will jump margins and profits at start of 2019 (i.e. less than a year). My view is that EPYC has already helped Earnings beat expectations, and that the jump in margins will start appearing as early as the next ER, more likely the ER out in July. EPYC appears to be gaining traction quickly from what I’ve read. The reasons why: price/performance and Meltdown. Long AMD since the $2 days, and buying more when it’s retreated to $10. This company is already showing it has turned around into a growth path.",

Our Board believes that it is in the best interests of the stockholders for the Board to have the flexibility to issue additional shares of Common Stock in any or all of the above circumstances.

"Well before being short AMD the last year, I had previously been long it for about a decade.  I cannot tell you how many times takeover rumors have come and gone.  Maybe 8 times, maybe 12?  there were probably more than that, I probably just missed them becasue I wasn't paying close attention for stretches of time. I think the most recent one was just in October IIRC?Not saying that someday it might not be true.  Just saying there are countless precedents for it not being so.p.s. Chris, you should start your comparative chart from 0 point of 1/12016, not 1/1/2015.  I find it more useful anyway (its what motivated me to step up to the plate and commit to my AMD short last March).",

Not long ago didn’t you have a price target in excess of $20 for early 2018. I remember reading articles authored by you celebrating AMD’s turn around and it’s great future. It appears that your sentiment has changed and AMD will not move any higher and in fact will be declining over time. What happened in 2017 that changed your sentiment in AMD and your $20+ price target moving forward. Thanks,

"You can not compare the sales of JD with the sales of Alibaba. Alibaba is mostly a commission based model with much, much higher margins, as you mentioned. 1$ with Alibaba is much more worth than 1$ of JD‘s abd will always stay more worth, as JD will not be able to lift the margin to Alibaba‘s level.

The Shorts are correctly highlighting declining legacy revenues. But that may prove to be false ‘confirmation bias’ and misleading  for the medium to long term revenues.

But if they hold on for more than a quarter or so they risk being burnt.Disclosure: I do not own Itron. But am simply responding to fallacious arguments to rationalize a short position.,

I love venmo and its potential growth but I am also concerned that Google and Apple as well as other companies like Chase are beginning to compete with Paypal and Venmo. Over past 12 months Paypal  stock has done fabulous; have I missed the boat or will it be another Netflix?,
"PYPL is such a great stock! We have a 2021 price target of $122 on this stock assuming EPS continues to grow at a rate of 22% over the next 5-years. Exposure to the fin-tech industry is extremely important growth investors. We have identified several other economic trends that investors need exposure to, see our portfolio and blog here: http://bit.ly/2uQ4t0hBest of luck everyone!",
You are assuming bitcoin has a future. Many disagree. PYPL would do much better to follow amazon into virtual banking and square into even more convenient mobile payment solutions that low consumer's costs dramatically.,
"I would much rather invest in companies who have experience in fintech like Paypal of which I am a shareholder, invest in bitcoin technologies rather than me invest in bitcoin. I don't have the knowledge nor the experience or risk threshold to do so.",
"Actually the article you referenced (my article) doesn't argue that crypto is a threat to $PYPL - in fact it argues the opposite, that $PYPL is uniquely positioned to add blockchain to its business model. Do better!",
"Isn't PayPal the company that was fined by the Feds for laundering Iranian and Cuban funds, while these countries were still under strong restrictions? If so, I would be concerned about how they might use these currencies.",
Venmo is more interesting in the short term too.,
"The article I read mentioned that these patents re crypto$ for PYPL date from 2016 if I understood so is this newer news.

PayPal will likely not implement this development directly on Bitcoin; there's much better cryptos to use like ETH or XLM which allow for various forms of smart contracts. What PayPal describing is essentially a specific smart contract formula; nothing new here.,
In other words they are looking into using block chain technology. Nothing to do with worthless crypto currency like bitcoin.,

"OyatMost large retail chains like Williams have real estate staff who are highly aware of the rents being charged and occupancy rates in all the shopping malls they occupy.   A good real estate manager is going to know where they are overpaying and will always try to re-negotiate the lease.   They also have locations where rents are below market.   Williams occupies relatively small spaces relative to anchors like Dicks or BBBY.   Not really comparable.  Anchors tend to get better rent rates because they bring traffic.  Small tenants like Williams are paying high rents typically because when the space was available, the mall owner likely had leverage because the type of high visibility choice locations a Williams wanted were in short supply.   Williams---from what I know of them--- is high end and wants to be located close to the other tenants that attract similar customers.  They normally have to pay up for the type of space and visibility they demand.",
"I feel, management over the last a few years were trying to buy back heavily and reduce shares counts outstanding, so that eps can be increased  substantially,  without the need to increasing top line.  The idea is still good, as long as they stay the course and continue to buy back as cash becomes possible, and take down the share counts.  With market cap now so low, a few hundred millions of buy back here  and a few hundred millions there, one can expect sooner or late, the EPS number will start to climb up big time and show the magic of pushing up share price big time.  Do not be fooled by the poor performance of the share price over the recent past.  Future is bright, guys",
"Looks like a repeat performance of the management buyout of West Marine last year.They do everything they can to reduce the profits and thus the market price, then the younger managers team with a private equity firm and buy at a bargain price not near true value. If you buy at this price you make 20% +or-. If you have owned it for 6 months or more and you get screwed. Only time will tell???",
"OyatThanks for writing.  I have not had time to digest it all and comment fully.   Your posting of the employment agreement changes for the CFO are just plain ""strange""--unless---she is being forced out on the company's terms.  The 25 mile clause is bizarre.  I have always wondered if the CFO is a lightweight who perhaps knows her GAAP but not able to communicate a good investment story.    Her concall explanations get bound up in useless accounting language in my view and don't give investors much of an overall picture. CEO is paid very well.  Also operates in the shadow of the founders.  The company is deliberately lacking transparency and seems to be more like  privately owned operation than a publicly owned one.  They disclose the minimum.  On concalls, the CEO gives long eloquent answers and by the end of the call has disclosed basically nothing much.   They do nothing to talk up expectations or the price of the stock and might be entertaining the idea of  going private, which would be more difficult to execute if the stock price goes higher.   It should be noted that  BBBY suddenly shut off a multi year pattern of heavy stock buybacks (about 8% or more of shares outstanding per year) last November which could avoid the 90 lookback  period per SEC rule 10b--18 (if inside information was shared with potential private buyers.)",
"Relative to WMY and Target, BBBY has the lowest debt, relative to total sales or total net earnings.  BBBY still has a much higher net profit margin that WMT and Target.  BTW, Amazon online sales do not make any net profit yet!!!!",
"KORS up about 100% over the last year.  Target up about 50% over the last 6 months.  I expect BBBY to at least double within a year!!!!  I also expect dividend will get a big increase, herhaps by 20-%, and earnings for the next 12 month will be 3-4$ per share.  Wait and see!!!",

So far they are doing well at this the only casualty being obviously stretched financials.The addressable market is huge not to mention addressable markets in energy and the transportation sector. Your sidetrack on whether climate change science is scientific or not is irrelevant....",

I've explained before why it will be impossible for Tesla to recover from the tooling nightmare they created for themselves on M3. This all goes back to not validating and testing production tools. In other words, being an arrogant, stubborn ass.Also they haven't tested or validated the POS cars either; Tesla likes to leave that to the customer. I'm sure that will work out just fine.

"@VA Wow this article is deeply flawed due to your confirmation bias affecting a flawed survey. Your whole premise of how tesla investors think is based on a survey of 93 people in the Tesla Motor Club.1) You surveyed tesla nerds, not tesla investors. Please find a survey of the investing community. Anyone in marketing (Two years experience myself) will tell you that it’s highly flawed and biased. For example, many of the people there know recent letters went out pushing back M3 delivery dates because they’re reservation holders. That creates a different set of results than tesla stockholders who might not be obsessing over VINs. If I go looking at investor predictions, the numbers are much more optimistic which means the stock is going to tank as “declining” M3 production numbers hit mainstream press. Wall Street consensus on M3 deliveries in Q1 is 15,000. They made 4,360 in Jan and Feb combined. That means they have March to go from 33% MoM to 428% MoM. Looking at the tesla vin tracking forums last night, chatter is that production has stopped although even I am a little skeptical that it got that bad. Latest posted VIN is still low to mid 9,000s. Either way on assembly line status as of right now, it’s all really bad news for Tesla. Official Q1 numbers from Tesla should release first few days of April like usual. Hence my April 20 puts. See: http://bit.ly/2G3XOSV and https://seekingalpha.c...2) Statistical significance requires at least a few hundred more people to respond. This is less an issue compared to my last point though.

"hey everyone I have a confession to make I'm embarrassed about but well I'm wicked long Tesla right now. it's totally nonsense I know because I actually can read financial statements very well and to toot my horn a little I can also grasp basic business principals like doing what you say you'll do, not pissing off your customers and instilling confidence with your suppliers, lenders, counterparties, etc...... one day I won't be long but actually I suspect I'll make quite a lot of money short. but not today because this stock will just keep rising on every bit of bad news until every clueless retail investor and space age millennial is scared off their Robinhood app.I suspect that a real and sharp collapse in growth and employment in the US will be needed for that. not tarriffs or Trump tweets or even north Korea. and when that happens I'll be flipping this trade with a vengeance and shorting my favorite overvalued company.my question to all you permabears and permabulls is what am I missing??? long today, short tomorrow. this is the smartest course, no?",
"Also we are so used to having constant new stories from Tesla but there is none.  They have tons of work to do to get to positive action across all business lines.

The countdown has begun.  Seems apropos;  t minus 90 days and counting...  Tesla’s days left on earth are... limited.,
"Model 3 production is meaningless without a lease option.  Even if Tesla could make 5,000/month they will not be able to sell them.   I talked to a sales manager at a large Chevy dealer and he said 90% of Bolts are leased.   If 90% of Model 3 order holders are expecting a lease then that leaves 50,000 who are willing to buy, but they put a deposit on a $35,000 car.  How many of those 50,000 want to buy a $50-60,000 car?   I expect that Tesla is already having difficulty finding buyers for the Model 3.",
From an objective point of view - the Model 3 is not yet profitable so production woes in Q1 are not a negative.   What is more important is the manufacture and delivery of the Model S and X because they are capable of generating positive gross margins.   Here there is a chasm between bears who expect a 14-15% Gross Margin (Tesla version) and some of us who expect 20-23% Gross Margin.   Then the bear camp maintains that sales of these two cars are significantly lower around the globe and the bull argument is that demand still exceeds supply.Finally we disagree about the SG&A expense - it is going to be interesting to see if the SG&A percentage of gross revenues decreases in Q1 showing some economies of scale.This is what the market wants to see - because the Model 3 story is really about Q2 and beyond.,
"""Starting from 2017's $11.8 billion combined revenue for Model S and X and other""Due to the new revenue recognition policy for RVG deals the starting point is about 12.3b.""...and assuming minimal Tesla Energy revenue growth in the next two years,"" Good assumption, but ""Services and other"" will grow a lot. Analysts probably estimate $1b revenue growth below the automotive revenue line. Assuming flat S/X that's 5.8b of Model 3 revenue. At 52.5k ASP that's about 110k units. That's my guess of their model.Note: analyst consensus is not necessarily the same as market expectations. The market expects most companies to beat expectations (aka ""whisper number""). I really don't know what the market expects from Tesla, besides sustained ~50% revenue growth.",

Period. Tesla Longs only see the 'future'....which is - exactly- why Musk keeps pointing his finger there. ( semi, roadster)It works. Full stop.No sense getting angry at VA for that fact.",
So expect for auto where does their income come from??? Tesla is the onlycustomer for the Gigafactory...the other auto companies  have their own battery partners...solar city continues to lose money.

Great article! Thanks a lot. A key mistake made by bears is that they think Tesla is an auto company. So Wrong! It is a high-tech company that will shake the world.,
"There were a lot of stocks almost two decades ago that never hit (or even *had*) clearly defined business goals, and there were people posting on the primary stock discussion site of the day (yahoo boards) wondering just like you are why they 1) at first kept going higher anyway, then 2) merely didn't fall, finally concluding that the stock price action showed it simply didn't matter that much.Until it suddenly did.I am particularly familiar with this history because I confess I was one of those people writing those posts trying to rationalize away this disconnect. Like I perceive you are doing here, I strove to convince myself that the seeming immunity to fall on business disappointments was even a bullish indicator, coming to a very similar encouragement that you did here: ""Now imagine what would happen if Tesla hit its revised goals."" A few years later, in forced self-reckoning to extract something of value from the financial and emotional pain that followed, I went back and found those posts to bookmark them and went back to reread them whenever needed to remind myself how foolish I was.  But alas Yahoo deleted their old board messages a couple years later.I guess everyone has to learn this lesson for themselves.  Good luck.",
"I would disagree and say that expectations are in the stratosphere, i.e. the stock has a bigger market cap than GM!!!! In order for Tesla to justify that market cap it has to pull the equivalent of drawing to a straight flush! It has to: a) dramatically increase volume, like 10x, b) while being capital constrained with no more debt capacity, c) establish a world class brand/distribution and service network, d) prove quality and reliability after a very rocky start and e) manufacture with the same skills as its much more competent competitors. And even if it DOES all that, the stock would still be overpriced at a market cap of $55 billion! So everything goes right and the stock has zippo upside!",
No mention of the ethics involved with misleading investors.,
"1- Assuming the poll is fairly new (based on its end date), what would Tesla Motor Club voters have said 5k/week would likely be achieved when Elon first announced his ""aspirational"" goal of (I believe) end of Q4 2017 (i.e. 6 months earlier than his more recent, less but still ""aspirational"" goal of end of Q2 2018)?  What would it have been when (if?) the target had been moved to Q118?  What will it be if Elon's aspirational goal is moved back yet again?2- If the aspirational goal nature is baked into Tesla's stock price, isn't also the idea that Tesla is a transformative, visionary company who does things differently baked in, too?  If Tesla continues to show that it is just another company, in terms of missing guidance and claims like a mass market 35K Model 3 when most Model 3s will sell for well more than that, shouldn't the company's image be damaged as well?3- Does the perception that Elon's statements are merely aspirational let the company benefit from lowered expectations in terms of where the company actually should be, regardless of the stated goals?  In other words, should Tesla already actually be at the 5k/week target by the end of Q1?  Would the current ""aspirational"" goal of end of Q218 have been a realistic (or even slower than expected goal for a normal/comparable car company) had that been the initially announced target rather than Q417?Let's say you're working on a home improvement project that ""should"" take 2-3 hours.  Before starting work at noon, you aspirationally say to your spouse that it will be done in 30 minutes because you have it all mapped out.  Not quite believing you'll succeed but still impressed, spouse leaves you to the work.  25 minutes later, spouse checks on you and sees relatively little accomplished; you say there were unexpected things like the home improvement store having a line, but you'll still be done in 35 more minutes (i.e. 1:00).  At 12:55, spouse comes out and you're still not close.  ""Not to worry.  My plan was too revolutionary for the house to understand, so I'm going to a more established method.  Still will be done by 2:00.""  Given how badly your previous two estimates were, spouse might actually be pleasantly surprised if you hit the 2:00 target, even though that was within the originally expected range of the project that you said you would finish in 30 minutes (i.e. it's not really much of an accomplishment beyond the norm, and your confidence suggested you were far above the norm).",
"Thank you VA for your thoughts. Given Tesla has traded in a volatile range for the prior 9-12 months (300-380 Usd per share) at a time when the general market has gravitated higher, I would say bulls expectations have been pared back as they are less willing to chase the price higher. Bears have been emboldened and more confident given the execution misses by Tesla. Given that short interest has remained relatively consistent throughout that period, I would argue the desire to buy has lessened. Expectations have indeed been lowered by bulls. However a further weakening of bullish confidence is exactly the driver for a sudden shift lower. Hence, I would argue the bearish case remains intact as this is the path one would expect to see (bulls questioning their expectations) . Given stock price movements tend to be non-linear, confidence remains the key, and confidence as your article suggests is waning.I am short Tesla.",

Talk about low expectations.  We’re doing good because the stock has not plunged.  VA there are some serious issues with this Model 3.

Wow. Is there any difference between Elon Musk and Trump except the Fan base' political leaning?,
"I agree that CURRENT expectations are low, but obviously the stock price reflects extremely high future expectations. If the Model 3 delay results in poorer revenues and constrained research spending, over time a strong damping of future expectations will be inevitable. So I do not agree that this situation is insignificant. What I see developing is that continual delays on FSD, the rise of more competitive BEVs, and more realistic expectations about Tesla's future revenues will combine to knock a lot of the ""glow"" out of the stock. We will have to see how quickly that develops, but Tesla's current high valuations are not in its favor. Tesla will probably not be shipping more than 5K Model 3s a MONTH in the third quarter. At that point, fiscal pressures are going to be ugly. If Tesla does not raise a significant amount of capital very soon, this stock is in deep trouble.",
"I'm pretty sure the stock doesn't react because bullish investors don't own the stock because of the model 3 or how production is going or cash flow.  They buy it for the promise of innovation.  So while they may be bearish on production, they are bullish on everything else.  If actual performance continues the way it has, that thesis will break, but your guess is as good as mine as to where that breaking point is.",

I believe their own CD34+ and Baxter's 34CD+ trials from a few years ago failed miserably but those studies were not for angina.",

Thanks for a great article. Let’s hope QRHC gets some wider interest on a company with a great future.,
Thank you for this useful article. Just one question: what happened on november 15 2017 when 7 millions shares were exchanged (shares outstanding are 15 million and public float is about 5 million)? I can't find any piece of information about it.Thanks a lot.,
"Nice article.  Very interesting business.  I think your valuation estimate is reasonable and that the stock will see a big move higher if management delivers on their continued profitability forecasts (as it already has after they reported Q3).I think the potential in this space is pretty large, certainly relative to the size of the business today.  So I think the long term potential is much greater still.  What I like about this business and management team is the potential for them to run it smartly for a very long time.  The asset light nature of the business allows for increasing returns on capital as you show and a high cash generation relative to investment which could be allocated in many value enhancing ways.I am also long.","Quest Resource Holding: A Sound Business Model, Successful Turnaround, And 23% EBITDA Yield"
"Absolutely agree with the premise. If Other Bets was spun off into it's own public company, it would have a positive market cap. I don't know what that would be, but clearly it would be in the billions. Waymo alone analysts have valued in the tens of billions. But right now it's all dragging down Alphabets market cap, which makes no sense. For an already undervalued company.",
Other bets such as Wayno did not have any values as these products are unlikely to be successful in the near future.,

"Like the article too. I've a accumulated Google for years. My challenge is that they've not successfully moved into new markets organically and even when through acquisition, they don't seem to know how to monetize anything but search. They have failed, are losing, or are not succeeding at g-suite, messaging, enterprise collaboration, social networks, Google fiber, shopping, finance, home, etc. Then, they don't seem to know how to monetize things unlike amazon who is a retailer first. The main reason I've held is because I think they will lead AI but that is very long term and again not sure if they will be able to monetize.",
"Google has been improving by cutting down its expenses on other bets. The amount spent on pet projects have far exceeded profits and the wins are just a small picture of what some would call lavish waste.

Google is running a tighter ship now and hopefully will be coming out with more great things that will make it profits. We will see.",
"Your point about looking at the 2 sides with a different lens vs a single lens is well takenHowever there are 2 properties I wish to addesss with the other bets.1) lack of transparency. There is virtually no information regarding these other bets to do any kind of valuation, it boils down to trust us and the financials indicate problems with trust 2) performance. Google has failed at virtually any  product not tied directly to its advertising business. So having faith in management in these other bets is problematic Now there seems to be various reports that waymo is making good progress in its efforts. We shall see how that pans out",
"Personally, I feel like the ""other bet"" most likely to pay off huge is Waymo. Right now, they appear to be the clear leaders in self-driving technology, and damn is that a potentially valuable business to be a first mover in. Between launching their own self-driving taxi service and licencing their technology to auto-makers who are falling behind in the self-driving race, Waymo has the potential to be a huge revenue generator.",
"Thanks for the Article.  Do you know if the advertising includes YouTube Advertising?  Are youtube TV revenues (the over the top streaming option) included in Other Bets?  Or Advertising?  Same question for maps.  Does advertising in Maps get lumped in with advertising revenue or is it part of Other Bets?  I agree with your premise and analogy.  Waymo alone could be the Tesla analog.  I wish they would adjust their public statements about dividends to say ""we are not opposed to paying dividends but see such attractive investment options that we do not expect to consider paying a dividend in the foreseeable future notwithstanding our strong and liquid balance sheet.""",

"Thanks Eric.I'm looking forward to your deeper dive into GOOGL's ""other bets"", as the next big winner out of that pool of innovation may be the catalyst for a richer valuation.While the hybrid (your illustration using Ford / Tesla was telling) yields a lower market cap today, I like GOOGL as an incubator for (potentially) disruptive technologies. Few successful growth firms have proven capable of exploring futures that involve the demise of their core business. (Where might Kodak be today if they had seriously funded a digital startup)? Perhaps not the best example, but countless other examples support the point.All the best.",

"The company has many things in common with the most successful in the diversified industrial sector. For one, the reduced revenue growth while earnings are kept growing with the aid of efficiency and share buybacks. That sounds a lot like MMM without the P/E of nearly twice Eaton's. Dividend increases with low, sustainable payouts --- that sounds like Illinois Tool Works or MMM. A diversified future in automated Electronics including Cummings Transmissions, as a JV, and increasing electronic automation technologies, like Emerson. The 3 aforementioned companies have a combined average of ~ 55 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. That makes Eaton a company worth investing in so long as the aforementioned reasons are still viable where Eaton is concerned. Being situated with operations in so many countries gives Eaton a probably bright future since tax reforms and a potential global industrial recovery are seeming probable so long as U.S. federal economic policies don't completely isolate us from the inevitable Global economy.",
Eaton has always traded at a discount due to its abysmal track record of redeploying capital. Share repurchase and dividends show that management cannot find investment opportunities. The company needs to exit the auto and truck related businesses for good and commit to growth or lever up and hold management's feet to the fire to execute on current portfolio. Remaining a diversified company just means you will never get the next upturn because this company is really more bond like than equity like.,"Eaton Corp.: Buy Now, Get Paid To Wait"

"Zynath,If Apple is headed in the direction you are pushing here.  Would it not be like Apple to keep the, higher end, back end processing coded for an in house CPU?  And if Apple does this.

In this way they will continue to provide the most profitable cloud framework with the highest margin.  Once again gaining the highest percentage of the cloud profits while owning a minority of the cloud business.  And by keeping the hardware side of the high end backend keyed to an in house CPU it all becomes possible for them only.  Keeping the low end  back end open source will allow startups and hobbyists to create the initial web sites with out losing out on the larger customers and those that grow into larger customers.I believe keeping it all open source is key to long term acceptance.

"With 2020 being nearly two years out I would look at a delayed construct vertical spread.  Buy your JAN 2020 $170 Calls today (at $12.50), then within the next 9 months sell the JAN 2020 $200 Call at a higher price than is available today.  Doing so reduces exposure during 2019 AND increases your ROI (depending on how much more you can sell the JAN 2020 $200 Call than you can today).Personally, I like the 2020 $200/$230 Call Spread at $7.85 (ROI 275%).  During 2017 AAPL went up 50% YoY.  So far this year AAPL is up 25% YoY.  Given Apple's initiatives in iPhone X (much higher ASPs that are only going to get higher), Apple Watch Series 4 and 5 (expansion of health functionality) and HomePod (coupled with AppleTV, Apple produced content and AR), AI personalization of functionalities, and governmental benefits of lower corporate taxes and cash repatriation, I think it is realistic that AAPL conservatively goes up another 35% in the next 21 months.  That puts AAPL, at minimum, at $240 by January 2020 with an 18.50 PE.",

Apple's various frameworks provide the means for a developer to easily and reliably access low level functionality in areas like voice interaction, machine learning, augmented reality, IoT, health, ... And now, Apple is sharing their internal learning around Swift event handling with developers.

Gazprom says it's production is up 17% y-o-y and European exports are up 30% y-o-y! Earnings should be very strong this year:http://bit.ly/2FP8kwb,
"For some fun with math. As many of you may know, Gazprom owns 95% of Gazprom-Neft. On 1/1/2016, Gazprom-Neft's shareprice was $9.65 and it's market cap was $9.25B - today it's shareprice is $24.63 and it's marketcap is $23.62B. Gazprom (OGZPY) on the other hand, had a $3.59 shareprice on 1/1/2016 and a 40.65B market cap, compared to a $4.76 shareprice and $53.96B market cap today. Why do I mention this? Because what it means is that the entire price appreciation of OGZPY since 1/1/2016 has been due to the increase in Neft's market cap (23.621B-9.25B * .95 ownership stake) = $13.64B vs a $13.30B increase in OGZPY during that same period. In otherwords, the market values OGZPY less as a standalone company today than it did on 1/1/2016.This is interesting, when you consider the full-year 2015 result vs 2017 results: OGZPY total revenue: $7.21B in 2015 vs $9.96B 2017. Total EPS: $.94 vs $1.29 today. Tangible Book value: $12.59 in 2015 vs $17.59 today. The company is better by basically every metric, yet the stock market is pricing it at a lower valuation today than it was 27 months ago. Amazing.",

(Gazprom has a 25% ownership interest in Neft, by the way).Back then I knew both of those stocks (SBRCY  and GZPFY) were very undervalued but didn't have the courage to stick to my convictions and take a large position in them, because I read all the western media and was scared out of my position. Not making the same mistake again.

A company like Akcea that will now have 2 drugs to sell or a big pharma company with dozens of products of which Inotersen would just be one of many?Lastly this deal lets them leverage all of the work Akcea has done in getting ready to market Volanesorsen.  They mentioned on the call that readiness to begin marketing Inotersen, when approved, was a primary concern.  Well which would you rather have - a company already in the process of setting up to market a new drug or a company that would have to start from scratch? For me the jury is still out on this deal.  I put no faith in today's knee jerk reaction.  The market loves to bash everything this company does and never gives them the benefit of the doubt.

I still believe there is a good possibility that IONS will spinoff the remaining shares of AKCA they hold to shareholders in a tax free spin in the next two years.

Let the court do the nasty dirty work and the lawyers make billions. I personally don't take these moves lightly, success? Who knows but management intent is now visable versus border line insane decisions before.The moves they made are correct, clean up near term maturies as they come via rolling most of them and using excess cash flow to retire what you can. JCP just did this move too. It's all you can do without access to a normal bond market and this amount of debt. For the first time in a long time I am far more positive on FTR. Actions are louder than words.One thing you need to consider with the common is the leverage factor. The market cap (forget the stock price) is rough;y 3-4% of the Enterprise Value of the firm. It's the tail of the tiger. It's a zero if they file but like any option value it has huge potential on recovery.

"Ok, here’s a question for you all readers and posters: Would you waste your time paying any attention to someone pretending to “save” you from a bad investment, that one being a kid with no more experience or wherewithal than having read -or so he claims- Peter Lynche’s (excellent) book? Someone, I must add, who is interested mainly in tech stocks (this NOT being one)? Someone who has no conviction whatsoever, claims to not be invested long or short and who posts elaborated and time-consuming posts, obviously for the only reason of getting a few clicks and, as a consequence, maybe $20 a year from it?Ok, that’s the definition of a total loser if I have ever seen one. Why would you waste even 10 seconds of your time when you have the opinions and ratings of the most established auditing firms in the world, such as Moody’s or Fitch, issuing them and adjusting them on a regular basis. And, above all, when you have the all-knowing (and all over reacting, especially on the downside) MARKET speaking clearly about not only the present but the future of this company?Here’s the deal: we are in FTR (or FTRPR, in my case) for one reason ONLY: to, speculatively, make quick, significant money. Or recoup as much as possible of the already lost. Very few if any are in FTR for 5-10 plus years. A few days, weeks, maybe 4 more months and we are out of Dodge, the lot of us. After all, no matter the situation, there are many other investment vehicles, or single stocks, much better deserving -and with much more potential for rewards- of our hard earned resources. From Apple to -if you go for long term big rewards-, GE. Not much risk in those. Not compared with what we are assuming here for the foreseeable future.

There will be many such opportunities for returns in the next decade. As I opined on another board FTR will be an interesting take over target as debt is paid down and refinanced and they return to profits with a combination of slowly improving operating metrics and cost controls. This doesn’t make sense I know to the going to zero crowd but of course that group never expected FTR would be refinancing debt  in March of 2018 through a $1.6 billion private placement debt structure with the bonds maturing in 2026.

FTR is certainly cheap and they do have debt problems and Churn.  The good news is they are doing something about their problems.

Long term bet---yes,
"The author suggests the ""saving grace"" may be an asset selloff. The ""potential"" for no return based on the savvy of this contribution could also be the ""potential"" for a triple bagger, the restoration of a high dividend.

the author left out the $360 million in cash in EV/EBITDA calculations,
"What an absurd, biased, ridiculous, so-called thesis: the author talks bs about cash flows and different shades of EBITDA to try to justify his particular doomsday scenario that has nothing to do with reality. And he chooses to not even mention PROFITS which is the ONLY thing needed to effectively reduce not only the debt burden but the interest of that debt whose service has been the main impediment to the path to profitability. Truth is Frontier will be profitable in 2018 and the levels of debt will continue being reduced by ever increasing numbers with the consequence of a snowball effect of increasing PROFITS for years to come, regardless of CHURN.But, evidently, the aim of the author is not to offer a clear examination of the potential return to shareholders, but rather the potential for the remaining shorts -many have covered since last week-, at the expense of rigor and honesty. And, of course, he doesn’t mention the holding of 20% of the total shares of the company by Blackrock, that DOUBLED its stake in the last quarter. Blackrock, mind you, is not only the biggest investment fund on the planet with over 6 TRILLION dollars in assets, not only in the business of making money -as opposed to no obtaining returns- that last year trounced the hefty gains of the S&P (20%) by reaching a 52% increase in their profits.So pay attention to the bs of this guy at your own peril. Meanwhile watch the price go up along with the volume as the shorts continue covering. And look for the PROFITS in upcoming quarters reports as the debt is refinanced and increasingly and significantly reduced. The rest is simply negative bs.",
"If the cutover wasn’t a complete disaster, we are not having this conversation today.....oh well.",
Your article was too early.  The $1.6B tender offer is out and new debt to be closed on by March 20.  It appears they eliminated the common dividend to reach terms on the new debt which according to their announcement will lower interest expense and presumably extend debt maturity dates.,
"Author, why do you think a DCF is appropriate for an entity as leveraged as FTR?  Why would not an analysis based on debt paydown from cash flow (let's assume there are no asset sales) and the leverage that that gives to FTR's equity be a better forecast of the value of FTR's equity?With $500 million of debt paid down, assuming no change in EV or share count, FTR's equity doubles from here.   With a $1 billion debt paid down, again making the same assumption about EV and share count, FTR's equity value rises to $20 a share. The thing about leverage is that it works ways.  It exacerbates the downside but it also exaggerates the upside.  I think you are right about FTR's risks, although I think FTR has made a meaningful step in reducing its refinancing risk by eliminating the dividend.  The job of management now is to stabilise the business.",

All these issues are priced in the stock. Upside/downside is just too huge to ignore. Some points you should consider:1. The company has managed to increase its cash balance from 326m$ to 414m$ (+88 or c.20% of MC). 2. They plan to return 200m$ in the US from abroad.3. They consider options of returning some capital to shareholders and they will discuss it at BoD next week. Say they use 100m$ for share buybacks (the approved program is 180m$). For a company with 450 m$ it could incur massive short squeeze.4. The company has several brands and business lines which provide more operational flexibility and optionality.

"Good article.  Let me add some healthcare color so everyone understands the gravity of this problem.The CMS reports healthcare is a 3.3T USD problem increasing at 4.3%, higher than GDP.  Yes, Trillion and going to continue to rise with no way to curb the problem because of the obesity epidemic.  The WHO recognized over 1.9 billion people in the world are obese.  The global obesity epidemic is causing an enormous strain on the rise cost of healthcare.  The problem isn’t a US problem and is not a western problem, it is a side effect of The Age of Abundance and impacts all well developed countries including Asia.  Imagine this, too much food supply is killing us early.  Nobody in their right mind could have imagined this problem  50 years ago.  Hence, CMS reports by 2025, the US cost of healthcare will be 20% of US GDP.  Wow!!!  Houston we got a problem!  So while the dumb media is talking about their BS this is a real serious problem the media is ignoring.  Technologists and entrepreneurs who look at the social-economic data knows where there is a BIG problem, there are BIG opportunities.  Fitbit casted their vision directly on this problem.  It is why I invested in FitBit.  There are too much market demand and nobody is focusing on a preventive solution like FitBit is.  The news with NIH, the 25M active users, etc... validates a subscription model can work paid by Uncle Sam and healthcare insurer.  With that said, this is a HiGHLY sensitive topic that has to be manage with utmost care and sensitivity to the consumers/patients.  We can’t have big brother imposing these GPS enabled tracking band.  That’s Orwellian right?  We can’t have government and institutions labeling fat people fat because that’s insensitive too.

For this reason I am not buying more stocks, just holding the previous position selling calls when the premium is attractive and selling puts when the stock falls back below $5.In the negative scenario the range could be 4 to 6, so it is more prudent to sell 4 strike puts going forward even if no 5 strike put ws exercised in the last 13 months and they provided good return.",

Anyone with new products but did not reach the revenue of over 3-4 hundred million within 3 years are cut. Any winners I may have I let it ride and hold as long as I can.

"178pharma : What you said might be true. But investment in biotech is often based on “calculated speculation” and wishful thinking. Take for example the following biotech: SAGE, LOXO, MDGL, NKTR, ARMO etc have all shot up 200-300%. in the last 3 months. The reason for the rise has NOTHING to do with their existing products ( if any). Except foe NKTR, none of them have a product in the market, furthermore it’s unlikely they will have any approved product in the next 2-3 years at the earliest. Take MDGL FOR EXAMPLE, it’s a thyroxine receptor agonist, it’s supposed to have special effect on NASH or lipemia. After they announced their study results the stock price had tripled. Now there are at least 8 other companies that’s working on NASH with publications in peer reviewed journals but none of them were taken seriously by the investment community. I attended a symposium on NASH last January, none of the “ experts” have heard of MDGL since it has no publication in any peer reviewed journals. Professor Paul Kwo ( Stanford) himself had done extensive research on NASH was doubtful of their claim since it has not published any data on peer reviewed journal. If you base your investment style based on pure logic, or sequence you’ll do better working for academia. If you want to make some serious money, think outside the box. Long : BLUE, ( KITE ), MDGL, NKTR. On the other hand, companies with cutting edge gateway protein inhibitors eg BMY, MRK etc with products making billions every year had no meaningful or very little action in their stock.

"The question is about the role of TGTX's combo in the CLL setting.Imbrubica and other BTKi are very popular now as r/r and front line CLL drug. TGTX's combo runs against Chemo, not BTKi, what is the implication here? Most of BTKi monotherapy have over 95% ORR in CLL naive patients.",

With the Ibrutinib and Venetoclax combo getting high rates of complete response and double digit rates of MRD negativity to look at ORR is quite a cop out.,

It's unclear to me that the 'eons of evolution' in bacteria translates to no need for fine-tuning in order to achieve clinical safety and efficacy.No mention of the patent issues surrounding CRISPR vs. the clarity around Sangamo's ZFNs.

(“Taurus”) in respect of its previously announced secured development finance facility (the “Facility” and the “Facility Agreement”).  The Facility includes the following:$165 million to be used towards funding the development of the Wahgnion Gold Project and to repay all of the Company’s current outstanding bank debt, totaling $15 million drawn on its revolving credit facility; $25 million to be used toward future advancement of a feasibility study for the Golden Hill Project (“Golden Hill”); and $10 million equipment lease facility carve out for which the Company has received a number of term sheets and is currently evaluating. In connection with the execution of the Facility Agreement, the Company today also issued to Taurus an aggregate of 2,000,000 unlisted 4-year warrants to acquire Teranga common shares at an exercise price equal to C$5.22.  Other material terms of the Facility were previously disclosed by Teranga in its press release of March 12, 2018 announcing the Commitment Letter for the Facility.All drawdowns by the Company of funds under the Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent.

By a quality project I am referring to the outstanding Teranga's Golden Hill project in Hounde. I was with Avion Gold back in 2009/2010 when Avion geologists first uncovered Hounde potential.  If Teranga down the road builds Golden Hill  then Teranga  easily will  double what they currently produce in Senegal in terms of ore grade and reserves.Perseus does not have that.

Well she's flying today... something going on or just a general catch up rally?,
Annual report is out.  There was one item that was puzzling: they show Annual cash flow sensitivity to a $1/bbl change in Brent price as $ 3.3 million ( roughly $3 million).  Seems odd considering they produce 80K bbls/day or close to  30 million bbls/yr.Any comments?,

"So selling the basin would get rid of this too...I see a simplified focus...LA basin on an ebitda basis worth more than 1b..and with the land acting as significant “value” to the prospective buyer, banks would be inclined to participate...250-300mm ebitda for the kitchen sink is worth every bit of 3b in a rising oil environment",
"If they say hedges are at 50% of oil production and we see greater than 50%,clearly they are looking to acquire more oil production in order to fit.. I need more clarity on PSC as well.. as for mgmt. being clear on conf call, they certainly seem to put the production decline squarely on the back of the one time extraordinary shut-ins that were significant and the hangover into Q1 persists. However, i do believe production declines are over even if they buy them which could change the makeup materially..they said 64/36oil/gas vs 72%/28% that they expect to achieve in the upcoming qtrs.which when I read between the lines oil production to increase. The issue with the stock is the momentum that is at play with CRC. a function of rising production and prices..but we need both to recognize the value of our investment here.",
"I would sell puts every day of week and twice on Sunday’s.. I believe oil going higher as for my rationale.. as for the cash on hand, they  have considerably more flexibility.. and will use it to stem production decline.. I also believe the hedge book is a mess as well but a necessity to move forward down this aggressive path of debt reduction as well increasing “free cash flow”... Who knows, they could do a blockbuster deal and sell LA basin w/ property too.. wipe out 50% of debt if not more.. and although be smaller, the inventory depth still would be deep.. 1/3rd of ebitda is worth about 2.4b plus land.. just a thought.. stock is waiting for something.. this sell off way overdone",
"Also, if I were willing to buy a bunch of CRC stock at a slightly lower price, does it make sense to sell puts at that price?",
Seems like a hedge for CRC long on the stock and a long time frame short on oil could be profitable - is anyone doing that?,
or they could buy back 2/3 of the company with that cash in hand.,
They don't 'like hedging'. They were probably required to hedge by their banks because they desperately need that cash flow to make their interest payments.  Huge build in oil this week and big production gains not helping bullish case this week.,
Took a position in CRC for the first time today..Let's see how it goes.,
Excellent article.  Worth looking back on as the price of oil fluctuates and see where the stock is,

"Note that they spent money on drilling unconventional wells earlier in the year, especially with BSP money(which is consolidated.) Assuming higher decline for these and a shift to steam/waterfloods (which take time to ramp up) in Q4, would explain why production rose in Q4 on same store basis but will decline in Q1.",
"1. Production sharing agreement lowered 4Q production by 3000 BOE (listened to raymond james conference webcast). The 1300 was additional to already guided PSC effect. Add 700 for fire, and same store would have been 129-130 MBOE for Q4 vs 128 for Q3, so actually growth.2. Q1 guidance of 120-125 vs Q3: 3000 PSC effect for Q4 + 600 additional PSC effect for Q1 + 400 for fire etc. -> same store 124-129. On CC said would be closer to 125 by end of Q1. Add the 3,600 for the PSC effects and that could be 127-129, again on same store basis compared to Q3. Not very good but hardly catastrophic.3. On conference call they said total production cost for year would be flat, if not down. That would be good.4. Hedges are going to be a huge headwind in 2H for current/higher prices.They have a total of: 16,000 sold calls, 19,000 swaps, 29,000 additional swap ""options"" for counterparty. Adds up to 64,000, 80% of oil production for about $60, don't like it.5. Buena Vista almost $3 premium to Brent, good. Why they guide Q1 realizations 92-96% of Brent, I don't know, since it is obviously going to be close to 100%Bought some more.",
"HFIR, I'm a big fan of your work.  I'm also a big investor in CRC.  This earnings report has me really spooked, and the guidance for lower production and higher expenses is particularly concerning.  If they can't arrest the production decline, higher oil prices won't be able to bail them out of their high fixed costs and interest expense.  I had discounted their performance pre-spin (spending $2bn/year to grow production minimally) as a relic of Oxy's poor management, and the low decline in 2015 and 2016 when they slashed capex seemed to back that up.  I'm not sure if the continued downtrend is deferred maintenance showing up finally (bad but manageable with more spending), a reflection of asset quality (really bad), or just an artifact of the ramp up in activity towards Q4 '17 with steamfloods/waterfloods that take time to reach plateau (more or less benign).  My model has production declining mid to low single digits per year unless they can spend at least $500mm a year (and production shows up, dry holes are a real risk).  I'm curious why they didn't guide to higher capex in 2018 given they have effectively 18% money sitting on the balance sheet.  I'm not a subscriber, but it would be cool to trade models.  I'm interested to see the capex/productivity underlying your model.I think CRC is in show me mode for the next few quarters.  I heard ""shifting from defense to offense"" and ""reach the inflection point in production mid year [2017]"" on the old conference calls, which clearly didn't happen.  They went from hitting near top of guidance in Q1 '17 to bottom of guidance and guiding lower the quarters since.  The stock is the opportunity of a lifetime if they can execute on production growth, and an extreme risk that may still work out if they continue on the current path and oil prices increase to where we think they will.",
HFIR - Thanks for the interesting contribution.  CRC has hedged a lot of their near term oil production (50%) at $60 which is a bearish price point in your model.  I think this was a fundamental issue in their 4Q2017 results and I expect to some extent in 1Q2018.   I understand that their policy  is to hedge ~50% of their production.   This has been prudent given their heave debt load etc... but they didn’t play for the upside here.   Do your numbers and importantly the probability %s factor their hedging policy?   The numbers are compelling but worry about the conservative hedging approach of CRC limiting the bull scenario.   Appreciate your thoughts.  GLTA. Long CRC,

The disconcerting part to me is how a $10 change ($60-$70)in the price of Brent can be such a swing in your stock price projections.  e.g. $60 Brent doesn't seem like a bad number and that equates to a $4-6 stock price, yet a 15% increase in the price of Brent to $70 results equates to a 20x projected stock price of $70-80 per share, which is insane.

"One thing that worries me a little about JD is that in the ecommerce business, the biggest player usually wins due to platform effects. JD is smaller than BABA and I think BABA has something like a 54% growth rate vs JD at 40%. So BABA is larger and growing faster.But I do get the impression that JD has a better service level with fewer fake goods, faster delivery, and better user experience than BABA. That can make a huge difference and is a good part of the reason Amazon is so hard to compete with. Amazon's user experience is really pretty amazing, particularly with the Prime program. Are  you familiar with the competitive aspects of platforms in ecommerce? If so, do you think BABA's size will make it hard for JD to grow in the long term? Also, do you think JD can out-compete BABA via a better user experience?For folks reading this article and comments, I should mention that high quality fakes are actually popular in China. There is a somewhat strong trend of conspicuous consumption in China. There is a lot of pressure and competition for marriage partners, and the appearance of success and wealth plays a big role in their social interactions. So high quality fakes have a pretty strong market.",
Amazon profits big time from the cloud. Soon Baba will too.JD no. Potential big problem,
"An indirect comparison here is Walmart. Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, although unlike JD, most of its sales come from physical stores. Today, Walmart has net margins of about 2.8% on sales of about $485B and the market values it at around 55% of sales.JD should ostensibly be able to make higher margins since it is driven by online sales, but if we were to assign JD double the net margin we are looking at about $3.1B net income. That figure imputes a PE of about 20 today, which is justifiable for its growth.This is just a back of the envelop calculation.

"It's interesting all the dirt being thrown at the author in the above comments.  In August 2018 Kees Decker put out a report on Argonaut, which updates his Seeking Alpha article from early 2016.  The August 2018 report has the title ""Argonaut Gold Incorporated: For Suckers"".  You should be able to get a copy of this report by contacting Kees at keesdek@gmail.com .  The e-mail's cover letter to the report contains in part these remarks, which I quote: ""Please find attached a valuation report on Argonaut Gold.  It is a revisit of the company after I did a report early in 2016, which was published on Seeking Alpha.  Followers amongst you who have been receiving my reports for a long time will know that I do not rate Argonaut highly.  It is an example of a company with management that pursues growth at all cost, or at least extending their tenure by keeping the production going, no matter what.  The company started off with a classy mine, the El Castillo operation in Mexico, which commenced production in 2010.  It had all the markings of a money spinner, which could reward its shareholders with good dividends.  This mine is now on its last legs and all its cash flow has been used for starting other operations and partially paying for acquisition of sub-economic projects.  Argonaut has since the 2016 report commenced operations at San Agustin and completed a feasibility study for its “flagship” project, Magino in Ontario, Canada.  It therefore merits a revisit to see whether the criticisms in the original report were valid, or not.  This study shows that the production growth of the company, supposedly from 150,000 oz per annum to 200,000 oz per annum, will come to an end in 2021 unless the Magino project is starting up.  The previous sentence has “supposedly” because the H1 2018 performance at El Castillo and La Colorada fell well short of plan and the actual annual performance may be closer to 150,000 oz than 200,000 oz.  Shareholders can only hope that Magino is not given the go-ahead.  The attached report argues that the validity of the reserve statement is suspect and input parameters used are far too optimistic when benchmarked.  After appropriate operating cost and capital expenditure adjustments Magino has actually a negative value.  This study comes to an intrinsic value of Argonaut that is less than half the valuation the market places on the company at 10 August 2018, but that assumes Magino is NOT given the go-ahead.  When Magino is given the go-ahead Argonaut has no value at all.  On past performance I suspect that this will not hold management back pushing for a go-ahead of the Magino project.  That is why the title of the report is: For Suckers.""   Granted, this report was written in August 2018, but Decker's bona fides and credentials to make such statements are considerable.  And, frankly, they go a long way to support Hamlet's suspicions about the company.  My advice is to STAND ASIDE.  Razz",
"Not sure where you got your training in resource modeling Hamlet, but you're almost totally wrong in your premise. First of all, drilling doesn't need to cut the deposit perpendicular to get a good estimate of true width. The true width gets calculated in the modeling process. (It's exceedingly rare for surface drilling to cross deposits perpendicular.) Additionally, when the mine geologist noted the single quartz vein that rolled in different directions - of course it does - the rocks and the quartz veins are folded. If you read and understand the FS Technical report issued by Argonaut, it explains precisely how the deposit and width were modeled. Argonaut modeled the main ore controlling structure, the contact of the intrusive with the metaseds, then built a relative distance model based on nearest drill hole assays and proximity to the feeder structure. There is no need to calculate the true width, because it is determined by the drill intercepts and the modeling process. As a mine geologist with over 30 years experience in the business, I can tell you this is the best way to model the resource.",
"Unfortunately, sites like Seeking Alpha are letting authors post meaningless garbage like this article, not to inform readers, but to confound and confuse. I'd hope the editors on this site would look at little more in depth on these types of articles from sources like Hamlet Capital, and if they deem their intent to be self serving, bar them from further articles. It sucks to see fake news slowly but surely debilitate social media blogs like this one.",
"I’m more concerned with Hamlet Capital’s angle with this strange article than the angle of Magino’s gold veins. Argonaut’s stock value is amazingly still only half of it’s book value, so the Magino deposit, which is still years out, is likely completely discounted already. If that’s all the dirt on Argonaut they can find, then I consider that a ringing endorsement for AR. Having owned shares in the company for a number of years, I’ve watched argonaut’s management team execute a near flawless strategy to leverage the company from a junior gold producer to their goal to become a mid-cap producer. They rise from 120,000 oz in 2017 to over 160,000 oz this year. They did this with zero debt on their books and without stock dilution. Pitting ar’s near perfect batting average against Hamlet Capital’s Seeking Alpha’s 50% success rating is a no brainer at best. If they’re short AR at this juncture they’re in for a world of hurt.",

"ROcketroj, what you describe is the so-called Free Market, no? Corporate raiders, big money, buyout firms and banks sensing money to be made, nothing new here. Only thing new was Trump, a supposedly GOP free market big businessman, deciding rules and processes are meant to be broken on a whim before all the normal process has taken place. I happen to think this was good for Qualcomm and U.S., for security and IP reasons,  but Trump's disregard for convention and rules and regulations may not always work in your favor, so be careful what you wish for. If we get the trade war he thinks is easy to win,  a different tune might be in order (a Prussian March, perhaps?). Also, you are quite wrong when you say: ""Prior to the new administration our Government seldom stood up for our industry, technology and IP. "" A key facet of the TPP was protecting US intellectual property and technology. Now that Trump has dumped that, we have nada there. If you are willing to go beyond ideology, the facts are there.",
"Good article.  Should be thank-you Trump.  Prior to the new administration our Government seldom stood up for our industry, technology and IP.  That needs to change in a big way for USA to maintain leadership.  The Rest Of World clearly sees the value of QCOM and is determined to take it and associated IP away.  Just look at the World Wide attack that has be mounted on QCOM over these past 4 years.  Apple was even able to get Obama's FTC to put it's heavy boot on our beautiful QCOM's neck 3 days before Trump took power.  Every attack was one more step toward the goal of eliminating QCOM so Rest of World can divvy up the spoils.",
It looks like game over for the hostile takeover.  Trump's order apparently cannot be appealed.  WD,
"One thing that is favorable for QCOM is IP concerns being front and center politically right now. In the past, I often asked why US leaders never said publicly that “we have been getting ripped off for years”. It’s good to hear it said out loud and directly to the thieves. When a country steals IP from an American company, they’re stealing from all of us. If China wants to receive equal respect, they’re gonna have to reciprocate. In the end, this will benefit QCOM. Now, if we can just get the American companies (AAPL) to stop stealing from QCOM!long both qcom and aapl..",
Seems like most of the comments are from QCOM investors. I’d be pissed to the way their board ignores them and has for three years or longer. I wonder how things will be different when the deed is gone and they are out of the news like before the first offer was made.,

"If you read between the lines of what Mnuchin said this morning on CNBC, he was saying that this deal is dead (see around 7:00): http://cnb.cx/2Ga46QQHe went into some detail about what happens when a company was denied a bid, and generally they pull the bid without publicly revealing CFIUS involvement. I think Mnuchin would have preferred this as the Trump administration doesn't want to appear as if it were getting in the way of business, but what likely happened was that Tan wouldn't take an unofficial ""no"" as an answer and is continuing to publicly pursue Qualcomm. He's not making any friends in government by forcing Mnuchin's hand here in postponing the shareholder meeting and making the whole affair very public. The next step sounds like a more official document that makes its way to the office of the president where he will likely officially deny the bid. I doubt Trump is too happy that Tan exploited a redomicile photo op to make an opportunistic bid for a besieged and important American tech giant. What's also interesting is that Mnuchin kept saying that it was a ""unique"" situation. I have no doubt that Qualcomm's involvement in standards development is critical to American intelligence gathering, but who knows what dirt they have on Broadcom as well. Tan's extremely aggressive move of ignoring the more diplomatic ""no"" makes him either very tenacious or very desperate; I think it's the end of the road for Broadcom's meteoric share price rise and Tan knows it.",

"Its interesting to see 11 nations signed deals to free trade without intellectual property protection. Possibility remains asian and other south american countries will follow it. Number of smartphones sold in those countries are much higher than US and Europe. Trade war is a bad news for QCOM.Protectionism is ultimately bad for US. All the key things in 5G or 4G are not rocket science. Non-US countries can definitely come up with their own standard. Even if it is a bit less optimum than 5G, it would hardly matter. Only reason QCOM dominates in standard is because of continuity not superiority of technologies (which they may or may not have). If other countries get together and sign trade agreement to go develop their own standard and abandon 5G in favor of their own standard, QCOM will be doomed. If China and South Korea agrees with something, asian and South American countries will follow along. But US and European market are smaller and not growing.",
Sorry to post an unrelated question - Was just going through 1099 and noticed that QCOM 2017 dividends were characterized as return of capital. Checked with broker and after some research they confirmed that all but December dividend were RoC and they would be reissuing 1099's for all QCOM shareholders. Was everyone aware of this? I must have been asleep at the switch. Did the company notify shareholders?,
All multinational companies do things for tax purposes. QCOM does different things to avoid paying US taxes as well. It ain't no US darling when it avoids paying taxes to the US. -> http://bit.ly/2IeniNS,

"With the focus on CFIUS and keeping American technology out of the hands of those damned foreigners, I invite you to read this NY Times article entitled: How Foreign Is Broadcom? I always prefer facts to hysterical rhetoric, distortion and spin. This article is useful as it looks at QCOM and AVGO side by side to present a concise snapshot.http://nyti.ms/2Dbvj2r",
"I see the angle CFIUS is coming in at for reason to block this takeover.  It's not that they think he will do bad things, it's that the possibility for bad things to happen increases.  With a new group of leaders, some may have other investments in other countries that they would like to share QCOM technology with, therefore opening it up and letting control slip.  Basically, everything that's already been said in the article and in the comments already I agree with.My personal take is that QCOM needs to wake up.  They have a frustrating management team, in my opinion, that would rather be right and lose money than be flexible and make money.  These countless patent trials, losing big customers, etc... it just seems like they are a company in it for the near term and not the long term.  Take a step back, does it make sense to get into a fight with Apple which generates a lot of money for QCOM?  Instead, Apple is now working with other suppliers and heck they went one step further and accelerated their own component R&D to help avoid having to use QCOM again.  In other words, QCOM made it such that it's a cheaper alternative (long term) for Apple to R&D their own hardware from scratch, than to rely on suppliers.  Now that they have done it... what's the tipping point for Samsung... LG...Sony... and all the other customers that rely on QCOM technology?I had a long QCOM position, but exited the position after AVGO offer was turned down.  I hate to say it, but this was a HUGE blessing in disguise for Tan.  There's no point in winning a treasure box of toys, if you are the only one that will play with them.",
"Mark - excellent analysis. I would posit that in the long term  for shareholders (as well as US  technology leadership) we are better off QCOM being a standalone company.   I would agree that Broadcomm would do a better job in the short term in improving the operational efficiency but it is akin to killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  By assuming a huge debt load, BRCM would have no option but to cut back on R&D and make a quick return on their investment (just ask former  BRCM employees). I had in a previous article   commented that Apple is using a back door to stifle competition, and has vested interest in the disappearance of QCOm.  The Chinese are in a conundrum- do they want to help VIVO, Xiaomi and OPPO by having access to the best of breed QCOM SOC solution or help Huwawei gain 5G tech leadership ).  Also after listening to the BRCM 4Q earnings call, skeptical of  Hoc Tan's style of pumping the stock. Broadcomm  management is not very transparent -just look at the gap  between GAAP vs NonGAAP earnings. Their acquisition strategy reminds me somewhat of Valeant (and we all know what happened ) I am hoping this near death expereince is a wake up call for QCOM managment, for way too long (because of their licensing mode)l they have been fat, dumb and happy.  There is clearly opportuity to improve ROI, by  streamline their operations and provide better return to their shareholders.However the biggest risk IMHO  is allowing China (indirectly)  to gain a leadership role in next generation communication technology.Disclosure:  LONG QCOM, but still willing to endure the short term price retraction for longer term gains  (till then happy to collect the dividends).",
"It seems odd to me that the committee on *foreign* investment (CFIUS) would take an interest in this merger. Broadcom is not a foreign company. CFIUS review is usually for takeover of an American company by a foreign company. Right now, CFIUS has been active in denying Chinese takeovers of US companies due to security and privacy concerns.

It has so many complex issues to resolve, from lawsuits over its patent fees and from foreign countries to whether the NXP merger will produce results to whether all this 5G hoopla will really pay off. Not sure anyone can really assess its future at this point, which is why a lot of people (but not me) like the idea of an $80 bird in the hand versus the $?? birds in the bush. The arguments set out by QCOM in proxy statements for not  selling to Broadcom sound good. I hope they are right and can execute them. Let's also not forget QCOM was languishing in the $40s before Broadcom made its bid. If the federal review keeps QCOM independent, I for one am not at all sure where the market is going to price QCOM.",
White card for me as well. Great article!,
I was fooled at first and voted for the merger.  I was very disappointed in QCOM.  I also own NXPi and wanted that acquisition to take place but at a higher price.

So I initially voted for the blue card but most recently changed my vote to the white card after I looked at the broader picture.  This article even broaden my view of the situation further.   Thanks for writing it all down and sharing.  It has verified my vote is correct voting with the White card.,
"Most people are currently clueless to the extent of what a strong giant QCOM will soon be. Im of the opinion that anyone who voted ""for"" the merger was either simple, short-sighted or both.

"I believe all these nonsense and resistance to QCOM is pure bs . Mainly , if you have invested in QCOM , the deal return a decent premium over the current price , it’s not as though AVGO is not going to grow after the acquisition or that 5G is disappearing , There’s no way Hock is going to give up a dominance in the market if allowed access to it . So what if Qualcomm is no longer an American name , Broadcom is or will be . What’s that worth ? 20% of your money ? What’s important is , it will likely to grow and more likely to grow under AVGO than it is for QCOM. You can either continue to invest in 5G under AVGO or move on to another company . Are you betting that QCOM is gonna ride the 6G as well ? If so it would be in AVGO as well if it’s profitable . Basically , even if you are expecting 100+ value from QCOM , that’s only 20% away from the offer price.  What’s you argument that AVGO can’t fare 20% as well I. The timeframe ?",

Your determination to acquire/raid/demolish QCOM is soon going to backfire in a significant way. You essentially helped shed some light into value and importance of what QCOM does. The whole industry and the government agencies have now come to realize how valuable QCOM is as a big engine for innovation that benefits all as well as U.S. technological leadership. This will help to resolve AAPL litigation faster and more favorable and it will be a smooth sail from there. QCOM will be stronger and more focused on doing true engineering and Innovation.Good luck with your financial engineering house",

"It seems to me that AVGO thinks that 5G is worth the price of the whole company.  Clearly the licensing business will be worth a small fraction of its current value should the changes that Hock Tan seems to be considering, be implemented.  Ironic that this situation has arisen as a result of the FTC charges, which seem to be focused on the same result (far smaller royalties) as is Tan.  Lift the suit, QCOM soars, and the deal disappears.",
"The shoes are in the other feet. IMO, this merge buyout deal isn't dead as large funds will become activists and change the outcome. If not,  QCOM will drop below $60 and stay under for the rest of year. Gary Cohn's resignation will start this off to bring QCOM below $60 .....😃",
"I am glad that QCOM will avoid the takeover and as soon as the price gets to $58, i am buying",

"I am glad for the Federal review because Broadcom wants nothing more than to export QCOM secrets to foreign soils like China.

Voted White Card. The only issue I can find with the entire article is the very end in that you are long Apple. I just hate Tim Crook. He is the rotten Apple  part of this AVGO drama. Go QCOM. Nice article!,
Qualcom has been very good to me all these years.  I see no reason to betray their excellent record with me!  I too voted the white card.,
"Very well reasoned article Mark. The issue that does not get enough attention in my view is the fact that Broadcom has no options but to ""private equity"" Qualcomm. The reality is they have to sell off divisions and patents in order to make a dent in the $120 billion in debt this company would have after close. ""Specifically, Broadcom's statements indicate that it is looking to take a “private equity” style direction if it acquires Qualcomm, which means reducing long-term investment, such as R&D, and focusing on short-term profitability""",
"As a long term Qualcomm shareholder (since early 1992), I think the case against Broadcom is simply that Qualcomm has more value than Broadcom is willing to admit.  None other than Warren Buffett has noted that a good deal must be good for both parties.  This one is not.  Broadcom intended to use Qualcomm's $39 billion cash and marketable securities to finance its own debt, which, even before the purchase of Qualcomm was much higher than is considered prudent for companies in the technology sector.  Broadcom probably also would have ended the Qualcomm-Apple dispute by acceding to Apple's wishes -- for an additional price, knowing that doing so would reduce the royalties Qualcomm gets from the rest of the industry.  No matter.  The plan was to get Qualcomm's cash, not to further Qualcomm's lead in wireless communications.The intrinsic value of Qualcomm does not depend on acquiring NXP Semiconductor, though the two companies would complement one another.  The intrinsic value is based mainly on Qualcomm's lead in its designs and proprietary technology.  Its modems are faster and can support more systems than those of any other firm, whether it be Huawei, Samsung, Intel, or Mediatek.  Its power management technology, in addition to its power saving processors, is more advanced than that of any other company, including Apple.Thanks to Apple, Qualcomm now has an opportunity to recover not only royalties owed by Apple's contract manufacturers but damages from Apple's tortious interference with the contractual agreements between its contract manufacturers and Qualcomm.  Additionally, Apple apparently has directly infringed several Qualcomm patents that are not in the category of ""standard essential patents"" that is the subject of regulatory and related actions.  The total damages that Qualcomm could recover from Apple alone exceed $50 billion, which is a conservative estimate that doesn't include punitive damages.That's where Qualcomm's fair value lies, and while it may take two or three years to resolve the legal issues, the 4% dividend makes it worthwhile holding, if not buying more.",
Thanks Mark for sharing your thoughts. Long QCOM.,
NXPI deal is far from done. Only 10% of shares have been tendered (where’s the 28% quoted by QCOM mgmt). 3M shares trade each day so they haven’t been tendered. It’s hard to get 70% of any population to agree on something and take the necessary action to demonstrate their agreement. 70% of shares tendered is going to require some more outreach to achieve.,
"Awesome Mark, great article!!",
Where are all the analyst revisions/reiterations? One would think they were smart enough to know this deal was dead in January.,
"Why do you think Broadcom is a security threat? It is a bunch of US based companies merged together. Hock Tan has been in the US since he was 18 and has worked mostly for US companies since graduating from MIT and Harvard:Hock Tan is Broadcom President, Chief Executive Officer and Director. He has held this position since March 2006. From September 2005 to January 2008, he served as chairman of the board of Integrated Device Technology. Prior to becoming chairman of IDT, Mr. Tan was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Integrated Circuit Systems from June 1999 to September 2005. Prior to ICS, Mr. Tan was Vice President of Finance with Commodore International from 1992 to 1994, and previously held senior management positions with PepsiCo and General Motors.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Long White Card! Oh and $QCOM.,
CEO Hock Tan looks like he takes the wrong meds. Or the right ones which keep him up all night at the disco.At the moment I'm very confused however: I agree with Mark on a topic. Takes some getting used to I guess. Maybe I can borrow some meds from Mr. Tan to speed up the process.,

"If the government, in their current protectionist mode, wants to interfere in a private market transaction to deny the long-suffering shareholders a well-deserved and long overdue premium on the QCOM's pathetic stock price performance, perhaps the government should nationalize the company at $100 per share. Otherwise they really have no business getting involved at this point. There is not even an agreed deal. It is unprecedented for CFIUS to review a deal that has not even been signed yet. It is an excuse by the Trump administration to exercise its protectionist agenda.",
If QCOM was being shady they would have kept quiet and collected the 8 billion fee that Broadcom would have to pay when this inevitability gets killed by regulators.I have to admit I'm surprised it looked like QCOM was going to lose the vote. QCOM shareholders would be at the mercy of AVGO if they got a majority of the board. that's not smart.,
"What a mess - hope my paltry investment in QCOM pays off. I’m more interested in a victory for them than simply monetary gains. Gee, should I buy more of this beleaguered stock?",
so does this mean that the broadcom take over is doa?,
"Besides taking good care of NXP shareholders, I also hope Qualcomm board take real effects in maximizing Qcom shareholder value. BTW, no need to blame Tan, business is business. Never seen one put $8B cancellation fee before. Do your own work, Qualcomm BOD.",

"The implication is that there are currently 13m share sold short. That was at 15m before the lockup ended. I think we're seeing a gradual selling of insider / early investor shares as well as some shorts covering since they've done well (especially if they opened the trade above $5). Given the limited prospects the big question is what will happen to the rest of the insider shares since they are still about 4x the float that's on the market. The chances of a big profit on those shares are likely smaller than the chances of ending up with $0, although the tradeoffs will be different for a VC with a portfolio compared to a founder who has nothing else.A best case may be a sale for around $100m which is still a huge discount to the current market cap.",

Shopify is in a whole different league than Wix.,
"Thanks for the contribution, appreciate your analysis. With over $ 1,000 M in current assets, Shopify will be able to make some wise investments in R&D or acquisitions that can have a significant impact on the revenues (let’s see what will happen) .

I disagree, but I can see the argument. But, shorting Shopify because you like WIX better is just nuts.",
"Army, thank you for the article. I think Wix and Shop do not compete. Even your diagram conclude it. The overlap for both is very small. I think you underestimate the TAM of Shop because they started with small merchants but today on, they will acquire bigger and bigger accounts. The market potential for ecommerce websites are far bigger, in economic perspective, then the usual website, and that's before we mentioned WordPress which is by far more popular then Wix.Anyway, appreciate your analayze.",
"It would seem to me that Shopify’s would be less effected in a economy slowdown as compared to Wix.

Short Shopify?!? Have you even read their earnings report. You don’t short a company like this with growth still strong (unless there’s fraud that Citron failed to prove).,
WIX has a bigger potential market share. This is true. Long term Ramy's recommendation makes sense. Way more room to grow for Wix if they play it right. They can add to their functionality and convert many customers to paying customers. The barrier to entry seems lower with WIX too. Nothing beats free.,

The author clearly hasn’t used both products as Shopify is the clear winner in the e commerce space,

I don't know of any agency pushing WIX :S Please let me know your thoughts @ Author",
Does your analysis take into account the 50% discount for the first year on WIX. They are discounting to get subscribers but really need them to pay what SHOP charges to have it make sense. Does that make sense?,
"I have a Wix website... it's ok, but it is just for hobby... and it is almost dead... maybe next year I will discontinue itOn the contrary if you do real business, e-commerce, we are heavvily invested and motivated... hence SHOP clients (especially the largest) are much much more linked to SHOP than average Wix clients",

You fail to mention SHOP's recent capital raise. Fairly significant I would have thought. Also by be paid monthly rather than annually means that bad debts should be far lower. Why short SHOP?,

"This is a very biased ""analysis"" if you call it so.Neither Shopify's moving into offline retail with the introduction of POS system or its lending arm, Shopify Capital is mentioned. Wix code is good, but it's just a feature, not a product. It's not comparable with the innovations Shopify is making. Take a look at Square Capital which was introduced in 2014, it's now a big part of Square's revenue and keeps growing at triple digits. Of course, people would love it if you make something in system more flexible and convenient to use but it's far from a game changer, say you could borrow money with a click at a low rate and pay it back simply with another click.

Also once they develop their tech, will they successfully sell it and turn a profit? It's big news to be sure, but I think we are far from yacht club on this one.",

This is set to be a separate public company, coming to market through a reverse takeover in mid-February of an entity listed today on the TSX Venture Exchange.” https://tgam.ca/2Dqael2",

Why would EMHTF be a sell at this time. What has changed to be a sell that I’m not seeing. I thought they we were moving in the right direction and growing.,
i dont think there are any articles where ted recommended etolf,
can someone enlight me on the last Teds recommendation....Inte... Group inc. I bought it under ETOLF in usa..  thru fidelity.it seems I am the only buyer but can't sell it as there no cap in America. did I buy under the right symbol? Someone knows about this company. anyone?,

"I recall a time when investing in gambling casinos and other forms of gambling were considered... well... gambling, not investing. I'm not old enough to remember Prohibition but having attended high school in the late 60's and 70's I can vividly recall music festivals and the Hippie Generation that every parent hoped would soon fade; it didn’t. People from the 60's have been smoking pot knowing it is illegal and still do. They have never stopped. In the 70's I worked at an Italian bakery and upstairs they gambled. Gambling, pot and booze have been around since before all of us were born. Why would any of this stop? I have no idea. Investing in any of these three areas at one time was considered to be foolish and ... gambling, not investing. Even alcohol was considered at one time to be a foolish investment – even though Joe Kennedy made enormous wealth from bootlegging from Canada. But it is all still here, are now industries and have been industries longer than any of us are alive. I agree most of the cannabis investments are not currently generating significant revenues and/or a profit. But like gambling in the 1980's once one state made it legal and the adjacent states saw the revenue that was being siphoned off and sent across the border, it was only a matter of time before what seemed like a very bad idea, became a necessary evil. Iowa's Governor said he could get past his aversion for horse racing, but not a state-run lottery - because the one was gambling and other wasn't. That was a distinction without a difference, and that soon faded. It faded right after the Meskwaki Indians offered to pay Polk County $1m/month to NOT put slot machines in the then failed horse racing track. The Polk County Board of Supervisors said, ""How much? How much are the Indians making up there in Tama!"" Money is money. Revenue is revenue, no matter how it is derived. State governments all have a huge problem with underfunded pensions and either stagnant or declining revenues. They all waste enormous sums on a failed war on drugs, pot included. It's only a matter of time before the will to say no, is overcome through the election process. I could go on and on and on, but I'll save you all from having to read what I think will happen. I'll just offer one piece of advice in the form of a question. When did you last have the opportunity to buy stocks at a fraction of a penny in a new industry with demand already baked into the equation? If Bacardi was a publicly traded company and you were able to buy shares at a price of $0.005, knowing what you know today would you turn down the opportunity to invest a few thousand dollars because Bacardi wasn't making money and at that time Prohibition hadn't yet ended but was beginning to wane? Everyone can find a few thousand dollars to invest in cannabis. How much do you spend on coffee every year? Why not take your coffee or gambling money, buy a few thousand shares of all these companies and then just hold for the long run? If out of 25 companies in which you invested, 24 failed and only one went to $40/share wouldn't it be worth it? [Using a nickel, a share, investing $1,000 equals 20,000 shares x $40/share = $800,000.] Would that have been worth betting on Bacardi? I don't smoke pot, but I do know when I see all those retiring baby boomers (of which I am one) who will put more and more financial strain on the federal and state governments. Too many of retirees and not enough tax revenues to support them. Too many people have not saved enough. Governments have no choice. Here let me prove it.Remember when gambling was just catching on? Colorado, Oregon and Washington State lit the match. And now how many others have had their resistance to legal recreational cannabis pushed aside to get a piece of the action? How is it working out? Nevada - $30 million in tax revenues in six months. Colorado since January 2014 and May of 2017 half a billion dollars - Do you really think Arizona and all the other neighboring states can sit by and ignore those numbers? The fire is spreading and cannot be stopped. Enough nay-saying. And stop trading. This is your one opportunity to get in and to change your life through disciplined investing. Play the long game. Don't get scared out of the trade. Buy and hold. If the price drops, buy more and hold. Give up that daily cup of $5 Joe for one year and instead buy cannabis stocks. Everyone has at least $2,000 sitting in their garages. Sell the garage junk on Craigslist and buy cannabis stocks. No excuses. Yes, you are going to lose some money along the way. But if you can diversify and hold on you’re about to make a lot more than you lose.I rest my case.",
T.O.Just saying that readers must look at Emerald's financials before purchasing shares. They have lncurred large losses.Thanks,
I will add a bit of wisdom to this thread. These stocks are purely speculative. Just look at their financials. The Blockchain currencies are dropping rapidly and the health company has major losses.  Look like plain gambles to me.,

"Mr. Ohashi, I can't tell from your comments whether you are an investor for long-term or a trader for the short run. Would you clarify for me?",
"down 30% in a week on no news, looking like a pump and dump.",
"Ted,I think you made a comment yesterday (and previously)  about lowering the  MJ portion of your portfolio at this point. Is that accurate?  Many of us have been buying recently, given the opportunity of low  low prices and desire to lower average price/share. Do we wait until there has been a recovery in prices to trim our stocks. Finally, what % of your MJ portfolio would be in DMG. It, too has dropped about 20% since your recommendation. Seems like a good time to increase our holdings. If I have a stock I like it to have at least 7% in my MJ portfolio. I want it to make a difference if it should increase dramatically. Does that seem accurate. Finally (again), what % should I allocate to DMG?Thanks Ted. Wish I had met you 30 years ago. Next lifetime.",
Big fall in DMG since purchase.   Seems like it was a bit high.,
"Hello Ted, my apology for flooding this thread with non DMG/EMH related comment, as I was affraid it could get missed in the 500+ comments old articles.Rather than asking what you think about Vancouver based Quadron Cannatec Corp, I've decided to share with you and the rest of your followers   who were looking to diverisfy their MJ portofolios with the companies which are related to MJ, yet are not LPs per se. All details are available on the company webisite for those who would like to find more information, however in a nutshell these guys are into automated exctractions, processing solutions, research and to some extend in packaging part of the MJ business. Assumption is they would provide some or all of the above solutions to big LPs.I havent fully researched the management team, however it appears that there is a good mix of finances/law/bio/chemi... expertise there along with some acomplishments from the past experiences.As you have already shared your logic regarding Lexaria and Radiente, I thought this Vancouver based company might worth your time and considerations.The comprehensiveness of your research/articles has been certainly appreciated by many of your followers and also benefited many of them. Thank you again. Disclaimer: I'm long on QCC opening a small position today at $0.40 CND",

"Ted,Recently Abattis Bioceucticals has completed several jvs and purchases including a cryptocurrency company call CannaNUMUS which I think is to be used in a similar manner as you state that DMGI will be above. I know that you cover and follow about six cannabis companies very closely, Abattis not being one of them, but I thought I would ask if you had also looked into this relationship and compared the two to decide that DMGI/EMHTF is better than Abattis/CannaNUMUS, and if so why? And if you hadn't compared them, then shouldn't they be? Ted, thank you for your time and voice in this industry. Your dissemination of information and guidance is invaluable!",
"Ted my man!!  So stoked (pun) you are jumping into blockchain!  I took a long shot on your opinion on a stock from this ages ago.  Great considerations for interested parties: GBTC(best stock to track bitcoin value), TSX:VPY and LVNSF (payment processors), HIVE (miner).For newcomers, the whole value speculation thing with decentralized currency started more as a bet AGAINST fiat currency than a bet that crypto would skyrocket.  I just love to think of it as a CO-OP bank.  Me and my buds are each other's bankers!  As a former IT geek and a former banker (disgruntled) I can not help but cheer (but still mostly interested in investing in blockchain vs crypto)!",

"Hi Ted, just want to thank you for this interesting DMG recommendation. From my perspective, I truly value being given ideas that are ""outside of the box"" as canned ideas are quite easy to come by and seldom result in significant gains over the medium and long-term. Your track record speaks for itself. DMG certainly has its share of risk, but fellow Ted followers should not expect to be indefinitely fed meat and potatoes. Being too overweight LPs carries its own risk as competition will result in casualties. Overall rising volumes and sales, however, will create opportunities for complementary services like DMG. I will dip a toe.",
Thanks Ted for another great pickI'm trying to figure out how much to put into dmgSay I hold 20k in lexaria What percentage of this would you put into dmg,
Thank you Ted. Appreciate your insight as always.,
"Sorry, I have to admit I am clueless about the business other than mining the cryptocurrency. I am hoping you can explain the rest of the business and how it will earn money, because I got nothing concrete from the article. Do I understand correctly that you are implying the Canadian Govt. is going to pay this block chain company for tracking marijuana transactions? Or require that cannabis companies pay the company and then provide the govt. with Block-Chain verified evidence of transactions?Do you think the buyers and sellers who want Govt. permits, or are required to report to the Govt., be paying the block chain company to record transactions and/or provide evidence to the Govt.?With personal and corporate taxes and GST, the onus is on the taxpayer to provide the govt. with whatever proof is required by the Govt., Unless the Govt. requires black-chain recorded transactions, there seems to be no need for transactions to be recorded in the block chain, so I am wondering how this business makes its money, other than being a bitcoin miner.  And unless the Govt. classify Block Chain evidence as acceptable receipts of transactions for tax or regulatory purposes, it cannot be used for that purpose.",
"Ted, thank you for the insightful article. Many of us are familiar with blockchain technology and I can see how the marijuana industry could benefit. The US industry would benefit even more because they cannot use traditional banking.Unlike marijuana growers, I don’t think there’s much room for multiple blockchains. That would defeat the purpose of it. I guess the biggest question I have, is why DMG? No doubt people on SA have heard of the hundreds of blockchain companies that have popped up stating to save the world. Why these guys and not the others? What kind of DD did Emerald do to pick these guys? We’re there other bidders for their business? I guess I have blockchain fatigue. I’ve heard it all and wasn’t adequately convinced by your article that these people are a sure ticket. People like to smoke weed. It’s an easy bet. Blockchain is much more risky.",
"Great idea to merge block chain technology with the Cannabis industry, but I’ll just stick with Emerald’s diversification and it’s 80% ownership in CannaChain. Now if we could just see it get listed on the NASDAQ like Cronos, that would be sweet! Thanks Ted.",
"in your rankings of companies to own i believe i know where canopy and sunniva are, where is dmggf, where rddtf is?",
"Hi All,In my experience with TD Ameritrade, you'll see a bigger discrepancy between bid/ask prices on certain stocks - particularly when it is a relatively obscure stock which not many folks are trading on their platform.I experienced the same thing when I was trying to buy Sunniva shortly after they went public.  My suggestion would be to put in a limit order at the price you are willing to buy at, and it will fill eventually. There have been times when my order filled in 20 minutes, and others when it took up to an hour. Depending on the size of your order, you may also see it fill slowly with a few shares at a time until the full order size is reached. Don't worry, you will not be hit with multiple transaction fee just the single $7.95 transaction fee for the entire order.Hope this helps.",
"Ted,  thank you for the article.  I tried to add this stock with a limit but using  Ameritrade and had no luck.  The limit buy was above the price which moved up and down for an hour.  This may be because I am in the US.  Is this like Sunniva where I had to call Ameritrade?",
"The biggest ""unknown"" in any  cryptocurrency mining is the uncertainty of the future share price of the blockchain company which currency you are mining. (As miners are being paid in the crypto currency they are actually mining) Assuming the same level of computing resources and mining difficulty levels a bitcoin miner who has mined a full bitcoin on Dec 17th, would've made $19086 USD vs $11430 USD on March 5th. As the rest of the operational expenses are fixed (hydro rates, rent, etc) the future price of any crypto currency is not only unknown but also very hard to forecast, otherwise I would be a miner tomorrow :)",
Thank you for an in depth article,
Thanks Ted. Seems that current ask of USD2.74 is too high for this stock. Curious to know what entry point you believe is reasonable based on your due diligence?,
Do you think the sec will give either companies issues? I am new to crypto/blockchain and I try to keep the 2 investments separate meaning ill invest in cannabis companies on exchanges like etrade and blockchain on cryptoexchanges such as binance. I try not to invest in companies that partner with or get funding from crypto.  I recently read an article that the sec is freezing companies that are getting involved with crypto/blockchain mostly  because how they are funded. Some of these ico's are not following the rules on how they are funded and they are using the money they are raising to invest in other things such as stocks. Ive heard of other ppl saying that crypto and the blockchain is a good way for these cannabis companies to transact and move their money around because they are not allowed to put their money in the banks but I feel like this can also be a red flag.  Your thoughts?,
P.s. thanks for writing!,
"Ted. Always like your articles. This is an interesting one, as not the usual Cannabis analysis which I have grown to love.   Block chain seems to be the new thing. I get that the technology will probably become useful in some capacity, but as far as the coins that are being mined, that part seems like a store of value with nothing inherently backing it.  I need to do more research on what makes one block chain company’s technology better. As well, will the major banking institutions get behind this?  A very interesting area, though might be too risky for me.",
"MJ/Crypto synergy...Very interesting. Thank you Ted. For Canadian based investors I would think ""DMGI"" would be preferred over ""DMGGF"" ?",

Thanks as always DRx.  Staying very Long and hopefully will Prosper.,
Enjoyed the article!Long and strong with GILD,
"DoctoRx, always pleasure to read your articles. Thanks for the great insight on what could be in the future for GILD. I think GILD will become a growth company in 4th qtr of this year and continue to do so as long as it's HIV domination does not get challenged. I really have high hopes for GLPG -GILD collabration (inflammation).",
Another exhibit on why you are the best author on Seeking Alpha.,
"All,If I learned anything in my morethtan three decade of tenure at biopharma industry it is this:For sustainability, any successful drug company must have a well conceived and executed life cycle management plan and products succession plan.  This important concept applies to any dominant an market leading product, disease treatment market domination, therapeutic area excellence, and even managment (epecially executive ones).So let's look at GILD.HIV:  Life cycle mangment A, succession plan B (Biktarvey threatened by VIIV's doulbets so far but undetermined future with theHIV cure)HCV: Life Cycle management F:  succession Plan C (intense pressure from Mavyret)Oncology:  Life Cycle management C; Succesion plan, failed initially with Zydelig and now TBD after Yescarta)Cardiology:  Life cycle managment F; Succession Plan FRepsiratory Therapeutics:  Life Cycle mangment: F. Succession Plan FExecuitve managment:  Life cycle mangment: C  Succession Plan D (actually unknow after John martin with Milligan at best only fair and totally missing now with Kevin Young left and Jim Meyers leaving, with a big unknown TBD after Norbert).It would be interesting to watch for the next few years along these haht I  have learned as critical success factors!",
"Addiitonally Doc,GILD had NEVER pursued IV vaccine for its own R&D program nor straegy and never tried to collaborate with any of the myriad HIV vaccine programs efforts for what I know.  Can you guess why?",
"Doc,Wth all due respect, I disagree that GILD's pursuit of HIV cure would be a ""Commeicia suiccess""!1.  We all know what happened to the HCV DAA revenu steam.2.  How  much would GILD be able to charge for the cure?3.  Dwindling HIV infected patient population word-wide (the latest is something like 33 miloin only).4.  Beyond PreP therapy regimen, there would be a HUGE revenue erosion for all of GILD:s ART combo's.5.  There would be severe pressure from he likes of WHO and Doctors WIthout Borders to compel access to the cure with minimal or no profit for GILD.Thus, cures are not good for Gilead's business. much less commccial success, unless GILD can charge a hefty premium, at the level of Yescarta (i.e., $373K per treatment regimen per patient).  Now, who would pay for that?",
My portfolio is up today.  Thanks for ABBV's stock performance.    Not even GILD's poor stock performance can drag my portfolio down today.    And I have 40% position in Gilead.,
Gild gambled on KITE and we still do not know if it will pay off,
"As a long term GILD shareholder, I was surprised that the recent news about the patent dispute with Merck, wherein the judge reversed the jury verdict for Merck of some $2 billion, would have had some positive impact on the share price.  Any reason why it didn't?",
Thanks DRx.  Another strong and positive article with keen insights from a long term participant in this space.  Invaluable.,
DoctoRx - Solid article that gives the SA community some in depth thoughts to contemplate and consider as they look for long term investing opportunities in the biopharma space. I happen to be a huge believer in the long term potential for the CAR-T space. IMO 20-30 years from now we will look back and remember this period as the Model T of the CAR-T life cycle. We are just beginning a secular change in how cancer and chronic diseases are treated. Thanks again for a very intriguing article. Long and strong GILD (recently added to my position) and dripping the dividends since they started paying one. All just my two cents. Slow and steady!  Good luck to all!,
"Great article, but I need to bring up a potential elephant in the room, Pro 140. It is in 2 phase 3 trials now and the PE results could not be better. GILD’s lunch will be stolen the longer they wait. Pro 140 works with no toxicity and no need for a combination of drugs. I have a hard time understanding how it has gotten to phase 3 without being bought yet. They are writhing a year of being on the market - not in some early pre-human stage.",
"Great article Doc,Cell therapies have massive potential in a very long term, maybe 10~30 years. It can probably cure many diseases. But lifetime chronic diseases are the best for pharma industry. Very sad but true...",
"Thank you for a very informative article and your long term perspective, DoctoRx.  Curing HIV is indeed likely to prove difficult, inasmuch as the viral genome integrates with that of the patient's lymphocytes, and in principle can be induced to generate new viral particles at any time.  But as you argue, if there were CAR-T cells floating around, primed to kill any cells newly infected with virus, it would be conceptually the same process as having CAR-T primed to attack newly emergent cancer cells. One question on Biktarvy - as someone who has experience as a prescribing physician, do you see it as adding to Gilead's arsenal, in the sense of extending the range of patients to be treated, or is its value essentially that of preventing loss of market share, given Gilead's dominance of the HIV space?",
"Fellow readers and Doc:  i am interested in your advice on holdings in GILD, NVS, ABBV  and CELG.  i own all four to have drug exposure and the proportions are about 30-20-60-10 respectively.  what changes would you recommend, as i bought them at 73 for GILD -50 i think for NVS- 55 for ABBV -95 for CELG in the IRA account so no taxes on switching.  they total about only 3 and 1/2 % of my portfolio, but thinking of expanding that %.  many thanks from maine for any thoughts.",
"I should have bought Gilead at its 52 week low of 64.If you snooze, you lose.",
"Let’s see, Wallmart over Amazon and not just one article but many. Was bullish on Celg at $120 but no longer at $87. Bullish on Regn  at $480 plus and not at $318. The doc is one of the most entertaining authors on here.",
Thanks for the article!,
"Doctor, excellent article ! Lots of very exciting possibilities here, for GILD, in my opinion. Long & strong GILD, I am expecting great things from them.",
"Im surprised given your mentioning CART and SGMO and an HIV cure in this article you did not mention that SGMO had trials with CCR5 edited HIV cells to cure HIV..That version was several years old and inferior but now they have a much better CCR5 construct and going back to trials with a NIH grant..also multiple universities were still researching ZFN edited T cells including CART cells at preclinical stage in between..There are over 100 patients with HIV out there with cells that were gene edited by SGMO.A HIV cure would be cash flow negative for GILD due to loss of recurring revenues, but maybe at some point in future GILD's HIV reservoir ""shock"" drug could be used at same time as SGMO HIV T cell drug to cure HIV..",
Thanks Doc. Excellent and detailed explanation of the science involving GILD and CAR-T.All is simple understandable language.Good work Doc.Hope it all pans out.Patients will be the true winners.,
"Doc, thanks as always for sharing your thoughts.  I agree with Carlo above and think it’s a true shame that companies seam to get punished for finding a cure vs a mgmt drug that lasts for years and decades.Costs to develop and bring cures to market HAVE to be fairly rewarded if we want actual cures brought forward.  Keep them coming!",
HIV cure is noble but not good business. With cure you get constant complaints about price and a shrinking customer base. With lifelong treatment you only have to deal with the former. HCV was the test.,
"Thanks for the read, glad to be in a similar boat!",
"Doctoro: Excellent  research report, well thought out with greatinsights going forward, Unless GILD gets involved with AI, Solidtumors,and or Chronic Diseases, having a cure for HIV could be a Hep C re do.",
"Fascinating article, Doc. Talking to CAR-T researchers these days is an exercise in barely-controlled excitement -- they are convinced they're onto something big here, powered not only by the cell alterations but by the computer power you mentioned. Research results that once took months to quantify can now be measured in seconds.My only cautionary note is that first-mover isn't quite the advantage it once was, because as mentioned in the TxCell article you linked, it can more rapidly be overcome today with money and technology. But I like and agree with your take on GILD's vision for this effort, and I hope that vision is as cohesive as you believe.",
SGMO gathered their experiance in immunology in HIVi expect a similar partnership for HIV betweet SGMO and GILD,
Really good analysis! I hear HIV hides out in the brain making drug access limited. Crossing the blood membrane barrier proved to be difficult.,
"What an exciting article, full of promise! Even if GILD/KITE doesn’t fulfill all of our dreams, it is opening the Pandora Box of future help with intractable diseases e.g. arthritis (when will rheumatoid arthritis get a long overdue attention)???",
"thanks for the article...but I would rather own CELG right now than GILD...in fact, that's what I did buying CELG at 87.00 few days ago, and selling 70% of my position in GILD @ 80.00 today.  My CELG/GILD positions are now equal weight.",

"IMO - CRZO has been and continues to be a highly manipulated stock.  Lots of volatility if you like roller coaster rides.  That being said, management remains a strong point.  The move into the Permian was costly but an important step in the right direction to become more oily.  Stock got slammed after posting solid Q4 results because of concerns over Q1 '18 production - give me a break.  I believe CRZO is one of the best independent operators out there and will continue to accumulate on dips...which there have been many!  I look for a strong rebound here,  even with stagnant commodity prices.",

Mid February, when the tumble seemed to bottom out, they reported, beat, and proclaimed what's been discussed here in this thread.Stock didn't really move much as a market recovery was in progress, but once things seemed ""clear"" in early March, it took off (as did other companies/sectors). Like, way off. Everyone here was expecting something close to $70 because of management's commentary and 2018 ""transitional"" outlook (also assuming the market stabilized and we went back to a 2017 type investing environment). When it surprised, crossed $70 and just kept going, there was some massive profit taking, and rightfully so with all the volatility up until then. Around that same time, we got the tariff news, so it rode that momentum down below its 50 DMA and a resistance around $64.It finally consolidated around the $60 mark, which was still below its 50 DMA, but had nowhere to really go without any substantial news and/or overall market sentiment increasing. As April dragged on, earnings started up and the tariff issue still lingered. Financials started reporting and it wasn't as great as everyone wanted. Mr. Market wasn't sure if we were really going to have a proper recovery, especially with a potential trade war lingering, so sentiment stayed muted and dropped more.MZOR isn't a sexy name like Amazon or Netflix, so any sector wide downturn will bring it down and once something starts breaking certain price points, it just goes until it finds a bottom. So down it went, and there is no news to speak of, or heavy trading volume, that could have stopped it along the way. It's finally found some legs again at this $54 level and it hasn't broken its 200 DMA, which is really good or else this would be a completely different conversation.As each month ends, investors try and time their profit taking to maximize their results for that month. MZOR closed almost neutral and it's now risen and closed up 6/8 days in May. Earnings are all coming in strong and market sentiment is stabilizing and rising up slowly. China tariffs are neutral, but moving forward with some minor, positive sentiment. The Iran deal news is being digested and a company like Apple, that has so much influence on tech and market sentiment, crushed and surprised and is hitting a new market cap. For the sake of investor psychology, that's a great thing.I like MZOR a lot and there is nothing they're doing that warrants them being oversold down below $60 and into mid-October 2017 levels. I think $60 is a fair value for the stock to build off of, and as such added to my position today at the open because I think it's stabilized and going to move positively as their EC is on Monday. Trading volume looks good and rising slightly. Short volume in April is at normal, average levels seen on a yearly basis. It's not high by any means, but not significantly lower than normal.I've charted MZOR and published it over on Trading View. It's approaching a resistance level at $56, which I'm just now realizing it hit after hours, HA. It feels like people are waking back up to it again, so I see us being back in the $56-60 range soon (which is where it should be any ways to begin with, minus news and market sentiment). If the EC is great, and I'm not going to pretend that I know if it will or won't, I think you'll see a price jump up towards $62 and possibly hitting that nice $64 level again and hanging out there for a while. It'll be back above its 50 DMA and ""stable"" once again so that it can grow back towards the $70 range the rest of the year.If you like to speculate some along with standard analysis, there was a great little news blurb on MZOR published today showing that it really is as amazing as the industry and others here have said: http://bit.ly/2rzXJzs",
So I read all this and it’s down down like a clown in downtown ! what’s wrong with this stock now ?,
"Thanks for the enlightening write up Taylor. I was in at $60 and holding long, hoping for another Intuitive which I sold at $355. Mistake because it eventually rocketed past $800 and split. My wife was smart enough to hold onto her shares.",
"Great article Taylor! However, maybe we could actually discuss MZOR and this unreal breakout that has just occurred?",
"Thanks for the article Taylor, always enjoy your thorough canslim analysis. Debating stops and market/security tops with online ""traders"" is akin to swimming upstream in a raging river. A waste of valuable energy and time.",
Placing  a  stop  loss on  any  security is  very  prudent  in  current  environment and  the  stock  price  could  move  down for  many  more  reasons  outside  of   Company  fundamentals   ie  planned insider  sales  algos   Common  market  drop  or   Novice  investors that  get scared  😱 and  sell  their  shares  too  quickly!!!,
"Finally hearing from other investor's, I have been purchasing shares of Mazor as early as 10 dollars a share. This stock has been the top performer in my portfolio. I guess what bothers me is, that no one speaks to market share when addressing Mazor. Or the fact that they are 1st to market. So, to say that this stock is at a top is so short sided. The benefits of Mazor robotics is completely unknown, they are just beginning to show the impact of the X system on the medical community. When I 1st invested there was just the Renaissance system, which is more of a singular solution, the X system brought a much more broad application with far reaching growth opportunities.  The medical industry barrier's to entry are still there. Mazor is finally knocking down those barriers. To say this is a top? is short sided to say the least. Just sayin...",
"I am amazed you have been criticised for using stops!!! What was the criticism?! This is a very compelling suggestion, though!",
"I bought in at $40. Not a day goes by when I don’t think this company’s stock is going to be the number one performer in my basket over the next 5-10 years, however volatile it may be... like today, when Gary Cohn quits his post as Trumps leading economic adviser and the market seems to get spooked after hours, costing MZOR 5 % points on the day. Ho-hum, I’m still gonna SWAN tonight :)",
"Great article. I'll echo what was said that management had said this was a transitional year, so growth would be limited. I'm in it for stability, consistency and leadership this year. A great play for the hi-tech medical field.The partnership with Medtronic is fantastic and they have an incredible product with the X. Looking forward to hearing more news from them and wouldn't be surprised if they popped. The technicals I've drawn show some strong potential as you've pointed out.",
"I like the stock, the partnership with Medtronic is a key step in the acceleration of robotics in the spine market. I follow also GMED (globus) because these 2 will make the B$ dollar market at term.",
"Thanks Taylor,just took a look at MZOR looks interesting, stock is sitting at 66.50 about 7% above pivot point if it pulls back 4% or so I might have to nibble,As always I enjoy your articles.",
I like Mazor Robotics' strategic partnership with Medtronic.But it is not my type of stock.  Too risky and too volatile for my taste.But my 23 year old son might like it.  He convinced his grandmother to buy him 100 shares of Nektar at 13 in January of 2017.  Last I checked Nektar was at 98.Perhaps Mazor Robotics has the potential to become another Intuitive Surgical.But I will sit on the sidelines for now.My focus right now is on Sherwin Williams.,
looks like an inverse head and shoulders to me,
"Great company been in it for a while now. I see it as more of a long term play, but always a chance of medtronic buying them out or short term momentum. Management said this is more of a consolidation year, so not expecting a big increase in overall sales growth short term. Revenue from existing systems continues to grow and they made profit for first time last quarter.",

"Problem is Taseko doesn't make any money, perhaps a dime or so, and the florence mine wont be in meaningful production for three years.......I cannot see this one being worth over two hundred million.....all the cash will be used to build that mine over the next three years, and they have debt also...........so you get a company that won't make a dime in net worth retained earnings for the next three years.....how can it be worth three hundred million?........",
"""Abysmal"", yes. ""Rational"", no. But  perhaps a couple of successive 'blow-out profitable' operating quarters without acts of God such as the recent wild fires, real non-Gibraltar project progress news combined with needed application of governmental policies based on obviously beneficial economic development rather than Ottawa's extremely suffocating political environmental and the biased First Nations relations imbalance would be helpful.",
"This share remains in the $1.20 level seems absymally low to me. Is there any rational argument for this? Why are people perpared to invest in commodity stocks operating in Congo, but not those operating in Canada?",
"Hey 33557645.   As a shareholder of Taseko, I would only consider any agreements on the NP land under the provisio that it is fully understood that the gold and copper belong  to Taseko. Mining for the common good, yes, transfer of ownership, out of the question, not going to happenIf the FN wants gold, they are very capable of employing drill crews and prospecting, just like us.I would be against selling off any pipeline projects, they are nearly impossible to replace. We have it made with our pipeline, just watch how this will unfold over the coming years. And besides, we have money now, $75Million paid back to bank and $88 Million on deposit with the next three Qtrs predicted to produce at LOM rates. Taseko is the best mining company that I've seen, Taseko's future can't be measured.   Happy Days to All",
"33557645, the raid you voted on was a earlier separate issue. What I am referring to is fairly recent involving a land claim decision by the Supreme Court. The FN was given title to around 1600 square kilometers account that area was historically a more permanent residential style camp. The Court also gave the FN the right to hunt and deal with wild horses on some surrounding areas account historical nomadic travels thru such areas. The court did not install rights of land ownership over these lands, only to the above lands which were known as the Williams Decision.What the FN has done, all the while when Taseko had an open door policy, and was working towards some sort of an agreement, [ so they thought ], was to come out of the blue with a Traditional Park proposal over those lands outside of the Williams Decision Lands,  where the Court gave them hunting and wild horses. And Yes, you guessed it. This proposed Traditional Park is right over top of the New Prosperity mineral deposit. Can you smell it yet??The Supreme Court did not indicate any Traditional Park, this is an FN initiative. To me, it looks contrived.",
What's a certain is that Russ will fook it up. It's getting impossible to make $$$ in the miners. They overspend spend like drunken sailers and always cap ex expenditures,
"Re The New Prosperity. This is far from over. If Taseko doesn't get the gold, then nobody gets the gold. And that's why we are in the power position and within the laws. Opponents will have to knock down those laws or supersede those laws to get our deposit. Russ made it crystal clear to the government in his letter with the three options.  What's going on here is an attempted  Claim Jump. And it came out of the blue [ Traditional Park ] totally unexpected. Very cunning to do this when others were working towards stakeholder involvement",
"I know the company for more than 20 years. When you look at the properties of Taseko, you can only wonder, what is going on with this company. Five outstanding properties in save jurisdictions and obviously so less traction.Apparently the problem with Taseko is focus.Taseko have to break up the company in five entities. A decade ago Lumina took that step and it became an incredible succes for their shareholders and the company.",
"It is going to be a long time before they get to a point where cash flow from existing mines will significantly exceed investment in developing projects. The other big issue is the price of copper, there's too much new capacity coming on stream at a time when the world economy is at a peak. It will be a bloodbath for copper producers when a downturn sets in. If that happens then that's when I will invest in TGB.",
Added more after the recent insider buying. http://bit.ly/2FZBIAK,
"The continued threat of dilution and a miserable 4th Q is what drove the price down. It never fails with a TGB.....It's always something!!!. That's the reason for the PPS decline.....that and absolutely zero confidence in Russ. Did you catch his last little  quip at the end of the Q&A. ""Hoping for $4 copper."" I guess if you can't get the share price up with $3.20 copper then you ask for $4.00 .",
"You are not alone in your puzzlement over recent price plunges (for me the >10% back-to-back drops in Feb. were baffling). I've bought in and out of Taseko for years, because the Gibraltar Mine is a cash cow. I am presently holding. Over the longterm I have been disappointed by (what appears to me) management's decisions to keep the balance sheet at zero or slightly negative, which puts downward pressure on the stock price. I know- it's growth vs. value. But longterm investors should see better returns when copper prices are above $3/Lb. My concern is that they'll keep fighting for approval of the New Prosperity project, which will continue to eat up (Gibraltar's) revenues. My hope is that they sell or spin off New Prosperity as a separate asset, permitting the rest of company to generate income for their stock holders. I believe the pragmatic solution to the New Prosperity project is to propose profit sharing with the First Nations stakeholders, and giving them the seat at the head of the table over the full mining plan. But given the adversarial history over this project, it seems wiser to me to spin the project off so that a new management team can start fresh with First Nations representatives.We shall see!",
"Perhaps the slump is due to this:  Taseko is linked to Hunter Dickinson, and Hunter Dickinson is linked to Northern Dynasty, and Northern Dynasty is linked to the Pebble project, and that can only mean, in certain eco-investors' minds, that it is all tainted.  Cash flow, minerals in the ground (even when it is Taesko's reserves, doesn't matter when eco-punishment is due. Especially if it means Taesko can get in ground/pit leaching for low quality ore.",
"Thank you Pete. I concur. As a long time follower and investor in the initial TKOCF which morphed into TGB some time ago my approach was to harvest handsome TGB profits during the 4th quarter of 2017 from bargain priced lots purchased at lows prior to the late 2017 stock price peak and am thus playing with house money to accumulate shares again at the current levels; trade and repeat.Anyway, this long time strategy has been working for me. I recommend it.",
Thanks,
"Thanks Peter for the info.I've owned TGB stock since 2012 - slowly backing out of it over time, taking losses nearly every year.  It would be great if my final holdings could turn a profit, but the history of the management of TGB is anything but stellar.  This gives me a reason to wait until the end of the year before pulling the plug on the final shares.  Hope you are right, but the management of a company can make it or break it under the best of conditions.",

"Search “Ganaxolone IPFS”, and then look at its MOA (mechanism of action). That’ll explain my posts...",
"Regarding my last long post, I am not “trolling”, as Jerome suggests. Ganaxolone was designed in a lab from a single methyl substitution of allopregnanolone. (For heaven’s sake, look it up in Wikipedia). This methylation rendered it unable to attach to the estrogen and progesterone receptors (unlike the former) to reduce the “neuro-steroid” effects—and thus potential side effects. In essence, making it a safer, purer anti-seizure play...However, my contention is that the neurosteroid effects (on the progesterone receptor specifically) is what it responsible for the efficacy in PPD (since Progesterone levels plummet right after pregnancy!). Thus, my belief is that SAGE’s drugs will be more effective in PPD than our drug, which has NO effect on the Progesterone receptors.",
I'm really hitting my pain threshold on this one. I bought on a dip and it slipped even further. Management definitely hasn't eased my concerns.

Probably why some insider selling recently.Upset at myself for not taking action when I saw things breaking down last few weeks. Looks like we need to wait for dust to settle, but agree with GDPPP, something from within management to help ease the pain would sure help.",
"I think everyone needs to study some basic science. Ganaxolone is different from brexanolone in one crucial way. It has one critical chemical modification which prevents it from binding to the progesterone receptors in the brain. This modification makes it more safe, as progesterone-receptor binding could induce steroid-like side effects (indeed, Prednisone’s effects are due specifically to its binding on this receptor). So, based on this, Ganaxolone is likely the safer drug for long-term use...that’s why it’s preferred in the pediatric population. HOWEVER, while it’s efficacy in seizure disorders is unaffected by this chemical modification, it is possible—even likely— that this drug WILL not work for MDD or PPD. The positive effects of brexanolone—especially in PPD— are due to its binding to the progesterone receptors. Ganaxolone has no effect on this receptor ...Indeed, the writing is on the wall, that Ganaxolone will be less effective. Will it be effective at all? The plus side: if it IS effective, it’ll clean brexanolone’s clock because it is the SAFER drug with less potential steroid-like side effects. The negative side: it is likely to not work at all for MDD or PPD. Indeed, look at it’s past failure in the PTSD trial....another behavioral trial...",

Hell, the name was at 80 1.5 months ago until Amazon was going to self insure their own employees....(I have no idea how investors can surmise that this affects CVS, even with Aetna?)The stock has huge FCF, growing EPS,  growing their PBM and will have huge competitive advantages with Aetna acquisition.

Some hopefuls are waiting for CVS to get to the $65 or below level to go in. Personally I'm not waiting that long.  This is an innovative company that is here to stay.  Maybe it'll take some time to get back to the $112 level but I say go long & reap the rewards.,

This has been the worst investment I have made in the last two years. Bought it originally in the low 80’s as a DGI position but the merger put a stop to that. It seems as if every time the stock gets some momentum it gets hammered back down. I’m holding it in hopes that they can create synergies that create some long term value but this stock is dead money until the merger goes through and management can show the debt load was worth it.,
I added more last week at $67.97. Yield is decent even if temporarily frozen. I expect another dip on debt fears when the Aetna deal closes and am planning to add more then.,
"Creative and proactive management too often means over-paying for perceived strategic benefits that frequently fail to materialize.  Meanwhile, the stock is burdened by debt costs, cash flow pressure, and eventual goodwill write offs.  This is my assessment of CVS’ Aetna acquisition. Risk is very elevated.  Any above market return is way off in the future, at best.  Wouldn’t go near it.",
"""Leverage is 2.25x, but stands to increase to 2.9x with Aetna's debt upon merger completion.""Is CVS not raising $45bn in debt to fund the cash portion of the debt? I can't remember the figures off hand, by my sense was that gearing would increase to about $80bn post merger against an merged EBITDA of ~$18.5bn. This would be around 4.4x. Then they would put off share repurchases and dividends till they had de-geared to about $64bn, which would take 24 months post-deal closing.I like CVS Health's fundamentals, but you have to be in for the long-run here to get your return.",The Investment Case For CVS

Your right. VMware can squash NTNX whenever they feel like it . Whenever they get in the mood.  They just haven't yet cause they weren't interested and didn't want the business. I better sell my all 5000 shares I bought  between 16 and 19 this past summer. Someone's smoking crack. I wonder whom?,
5 weeks ago I said to someone here wait until you see the stock price after next CC as they were saying the stock price was overvalued. That time the price was around €30 and i felt it was a good time to buy but now that its up 50% in 5 weeks...,
You have to love a comment that tells you that a company Ntnx is overvalued and you should sell! Then tells you they are going to short the stock! That they know the future of the companies growth?? So short away.,
"Sorry guys. I got long at $15 and I still have 30% of my original position. Sadly, there is too much optimism at these levels, a $7bil market cap. There will be stumbling blocks ahead for these guys and we can't all be blind bulls assuming they will just continue their trajectory like VMware did. They have upset too many server competitors and too many storage competitors. They can say ""VMware is our competitor"" all they want, but they have pi##ed off way too many would-be partners on their growth blaze. VMware on the other hand, has not pi##ed of these would-be partners of Nutanix. In fact, all of the server and storage companies they upset, are all very strong VMware partners. I get that customers want to reduce ESX licensing and that they use Nutanix as the stick, or the replacement. Don't come at me with a bunch of junior arguments because I do this for a living and I know this space well. You can't just assume growth and do TAM % and arrive at a valuation multiple. Sorry. If it were that easy, we would all be millionaires (yes, I am talking to you others because I am one already). Nutanix is rich at a $7bil market cap until their SW-only story really starts to accelerate much more rapidly. They are struggling to pick up the server and storage partners that VMware has had in their back pocket for many years. This is not shifting yet guys. Don't get ahead of yourselves writing articles about how this is a great time to buy in. It isn't. This stock can trade right back below $30 in no time, and will do so as they will slip execution in one of the next few quarters. 20% of their sales team is at their quota right now. Trust me. This is fact. That will catch up with them eventually. Dell/EMC's HCI revenue is already 2x that of Nutanix gang. Wake up to that fact. Also wake up to the fact that Dell owns a large majority of VMware through their EMC acquisition. I will leave you all with this. Anyone familiar with RedHat? They basically make all of their revenue on support and services of Enterprise Linux. What is at the core of Nutanix and their so called special sauce??? Well, it is the linux kernel virtual manager, KVM. VMware could absolutely re-distribute most of what Nutanix just did, since it is mostly GPL-bound due to it being written on top of KVM. VMware could come out with a new KVM distro, compete directly with Nutanix where they want to, and do a support and services model just like RedHat does for Enterprise Linux. You don't think that will happen? It can easily happen when they feel like squashing Nutanix at some point. It just hasn't happend yet because Nutanix is not big yet. So gang, understand what you buy before you buy and don't treat current technology trends as if they will be the future technology trends. VMware still has massive ecosystem critical mass and they could quell a lot of this Nutanix noise when they feel like it. And no, nobody is going to pay a premium above $7bil for NTNX. They don't have enough revenue and their GTM is very much in transition. There is too much risk there. In summary, if you understand what I explained above, the risk is to the downside over the next 12 months. I would start to be short around these levels and not enter into a new long position. Good luck.",
"$60 by May 5th, and then sell 1/2 the position.",
"There was an interesting research report written up by Merrill Lynch at the IPO that talked about Nutanix getting to an 11% market share of the private cloud, similar to VMWare in their business. They calculated the TAM at around 130 billion right now. This puts them in the 13-14 billion revenue and assuming it’s all software, take a 10x multiple on it at that time. 150 billion market cap versus 7 billion today.",

There's so many I won't post links but I will summarize that overall they were more negative than I had anticipated. This included quite a bit of adverse side-effects for many users. The ingrediants weren't outstanding compared to other brands.Another area I looked at was user reviews, from 2 sites which claimed the posters were verified as genuine users. Amazon is a favorite of mine for researching products. Considering these were people who had bought the shakes for personal consumption, 62% gave it 5*, the highest rating. The comments there were typically that they had been using what they bought for a few days and were happy to be losing weight. The 1* ratings were filled with complaints about side effects, and curiously about receiving packaging that was expired or with the UPC and labels scratched off.On another site that was not hosting comments from direct buyers there were lots of complaints about the pushy distributors, high prices, bad taste, and basements of product they couldn't sell. One site ranked their top 10 shake products and HLF was not on the list.My conclusions are that if it's all about competing in the protein shake arena, HLF is not as attractive as I imagined, with lots of competition.  Their strength seems to be their size, presentation, and the coaching/handholding of desperate obese people to lose weight.",

My impression is the only writers remaining on the HLF threads are all-talk SJWs, repeating the same, now five plus years old,  ""end is near"" message.

I'm interested in discussions with longs and, especially, shorts.  I'd like to include individuals who are current participants in the HLF business opportunity, as I believe you have a unique perspective on what's really happening.The only ""pre-requisite"" is that you have bet money on either side of the HLF trade, currently or in the past, still follow the stock closely, if currently ""out"" are looking for a time/price to get back ""in"", are respectful of opposite ideas, are willing to discuss what you see as both sides of the issues and can disagree without being disagreeable.  People in the business opportunity are also invited -- I think of you as people with real money at risk.Personally, as the stock price rises, I am focused more than ever on reasons to either increase my long even further, sell it or possibly roll it over into a short.  I doubt very much that the stock will be at or near 100 a year from now.  I'm intensely interested in other investors' logic and perspectives behind their long or short investment and the perspectives of people actually in the business now with a broad perspective of what's really happening at grass-roots level.If interested, please contact me by PM and we can go from there.No SJWs need apply -- I have less than zero interest in their agenda and not much respect for their 100% one-sided approach to what they write.",

He's evaluated both sides carefully and picked his side. Or decided - as is most often the case -- he doesn't know enough to pick a side.  There are ALWAYS two sides to every risk investment. Once youknow them fully, you can decide whether or not you believe there is a mispricing and invest accordingly.

""What In God's Name Is The Herbalife Long Thesis At $95 Per Share?""First, a chuckle...   ""God"" -- whatever ""God"" you believe in, if any -- doesn't give a whit about any stock price.  Calling on God's name to help you decide a stock's valuation is a bit over the top, don't you think?But, anyway...I didn't comment on your headline question previously because I didn't believe I had anything of value to add.  Yes, there were obvious short-term positive responses -- the upcoming tender being the largest of them.  There were three longer-term possibilities I thought might make HLF a buy at $95, as well as a number of negative thoughts (as commented upon here extensively) that might send it down.  I didn't care to write about positives as the reaction on the SA HLF board to any future positive possibility about HLF is usually met with so much derision and emotion and not much analysis that I usually don't write about positive things any more.  Just for example, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see someone respond to this comment with something like -- ""You said you didn't write here anymore, but here you are.  Doesn't that mean you're a liar?  Or maybe, ""Your'e only a tout"", or some other brilliant insight that helps make them feel good about shooting at me.  I now laugh at that stuff -- having a lot of stock at current prices with a much, much lower basis buys a lot of thick skin!  Anyway, It seems very few on the board can accept the difference between ""possibility"", ""probability"" and ""certainty"", maybe because nearly all the antis are 100% ""certain"" that nothing good can ever happen at HLF.  At any rate, there were three possibilities I considered that might answer your question on the upside...  1.  in the last two quarterly reports I saw what could be the beginning of a fundamental turnaround.  As I mentioned in previous comments, from my years of following cyclical companies and stocks, turnarounds develop slowly and if you think you see signs you have to jump on the stock early to make money as by the time a turnaround is obvious the bulk of the move is over -- of course, jumping on doesn't mean you're right.  I thought that IF the turnaround was in play then the valuation could expand.  2.  The upcoming tender was always part of it, as if it's going to happen it will need to be at higher than market pricing, and 3.  there is still a possibility of going private at a higher price.  My own view is that Icahn has a long history of doing things to make money that are not apparent to mere mortals (although I mentioned several possibilities in comments a long time ago).  Of course, most here use what I believe is simplistic logic to conclude he will never do a going private -- the ""price is too high"" is a favorite, as if they knew what ""too high"" means to an LBO King.  But, net net, I thought your original question was reasonable, even if I disagreed with your analysis.  I didn't read much of the subsequent commentary as I didn't expect to find much useful stock observations there..But, today we have a new factor that increases my confidence of higher prices.  I suppose everyone has now read some of the detail in yesterday's HLF announcement that they refinanced a substantial part of their LTD.  It's HOW they did it that is of interest to me.  First, they sold a convertible, and the cash interest rate is only 0.625% higher than their base rate on their existing debt.  Second, it is for 6 years.  Third, Wall Street thought enough about the deal that it was increased from the announced $500 mm to $550 mm.  Fourth, the conversion price, at $125 (technically, $124.96) was an astounding 30% premium over market price.  Fifth, the company essentially neutralized any negative market impact from future capped calls unwinding.  The financing was big and very clever and extremely well recieved by Wall Street.  Thank you Carl Icahn and your Directors.All of that says, to me, that even if I personally can't make a strong case for HLF stock price at current market, lots of Wall Streeters who are putting up lots of money see the case.  Of all the factoids, the 30% Conversion Premium to market jumps out at me.And, yes, the fuutre is always unknown.  But, in answer to your headline question, I'd say some people and institutions far more knowledgable than any of us about the company and stock are showing lots of confidence in the future.  Of course, they put money behind their beliefs, rather than just talk.",

"Author: Thank you for another deep dive into Herbalife’s dark world, thereby exposing the serious flaws in its business model and its questionable viability as an investment vehicle.You wrote: “Even though GNC is a failing business with a lot of debt, Herbalife could at least make a transaction with a similarly situated company so they have something to point back to and say ""Hey look, we are not just an MLM company anymore"".That seems to be the biggest opportunity for the company going forward. They’re making this name change now and so it seems like it wouldn’t be a bad idea to make somewhat of a business model pivot now, as well.”Per Herbalife’s 10-K for 2017, that sort of scenario doesn’t appear to be an option for Herbalife:“We are a party to an agreement with our Members that provides assurances, to the extent legally permitted, we will not sell Herbalife products worldwide through any distribution channel other than our network of independent Herbalife Members. Thus, WE ARE CONTRACTUALLY PROHIBITED FROM EXPANDING OUR BUSINESS BY SELLING HERBALIFE PRODUCTS THROUGH OTHER DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO OUR COMPETITORS, such as over the Internet, through wholesale sales, by establishing retail stores or through mail order systems. Since this is an open-ended commitment, there can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of innovative new distribution channels that are developed in the future.” [emphasis added] http://hrbl.me/2y0w9kO (pp. 24 & 25)In addition to the Headwinds you identified, Herbalife still faces a couple of issues on the regulatory front which IMO warrant investors’ attention. I don’t have to tell any well-informed investors that Herbalife has proven adroit at deceiving business opportunity participants since its founding by an obvious charlatan in 1980. The company began actively deceiving its shareholders and regulators when Herbalife Pres. Des. claimed Herbalife had no visibility into the level of detail re. extra- channel product sales requested by Greenlight Capital’s, David Einhorn in May of 2012. That claim was belied by Herbalife’s own rule 18-E which mandated that distributors maintain the requested data for a period of two or more years under threat of distributorship forfeiture.The deceptions continued with Herbalife’s gross misrepresentation of the FTC’s findings on the very day they were announced by the FTC. Last year, the company pulled forward one month of Q2 sales to its Q1 volume-point sales metric to successfully create the false impression that it had reversed the YoY decline in worldwide sales it posted in Q4, 2016. Other key regulatory issues remain in play1. On 4 June, 2017, Herbalife issued a press release which claimed that in May, ~400,000 Preferred Members in the U.S. generated 90% of Herbalife’s sales with an implausible average of 7.5 product purchases, thereby exceeding by 10% the 80% retail sales threshold mandated by the FTC Settlement Order. http://hrbl.me/2ul4j00. It The press release included a projection of a third quarter of net sales declines. After investor and distributor concerns had been ameliorated, the company published its quarterly “Key Metrics” which reported that as of the end of Q2, Herbalife had actually accumulated a total of only 117,818 Preferred Members in the U.S. http://bit.ly/2FIra94. According to its own calculations, unless Herbalife finds a way to recruit 158,574 Preferred Members who average 7.5 retail product purchases/month without increasing its number of intentional distributors by the end of 2018:a. The company will miss its stipulated 80% rewardable-transaction benchmark,b. Its Sales Leaders will lose eligibility for some overrides or have them clawed back,c. Sales Leader aspirants will see what is happening, andd. A mass salesforce exodus could easily ensue.2. In November, China apparently completed a crackdown on MLM firms with no indication that Herbalife had been caught up in its sweeping regulatory initiative.On 12 February, Herbalife issued another press release, announcing “... it has created its first ever ""China Growth and Impact Investment Fund"" [$90 million] to stimulate the development of its business and accelerate growth in China and help address challenging public-policy issues such as the rise in obesity.FUNDS FOR THIS NEW INITIATIVE WERE GRANTED TO HERBALIFE NUTRITION BY GOVERNMENTS IN CHINA as part of an economic development package for its proven contribution and commitment to the continuing growth and success of the Chinese economy.” [emphasis added] http://hrbl.me/2BXinkBOn the company’s 22 February, 2018 earnings call, Herbalife CEO Rich Goudis said,“Speaking of collaboration with governments, we previously received approximately $90 million in grants over the past few years by governments in China as part of an economic development package for our proven contribution and commitment to the continuing growth and success of the Chinese economy.We recently announced our commitment to use these funds for our first China growth and impact investment fund to invest in the continued long-term development of our business and help address challenging public policy issues, such as the increasing rates of obesity in that country.This China growth and impact investment fund will focus on five key areas: new acquisitions and health and wellness products and companies; expansion of Nutrition Clubs; increasing and improving technology, providing additional research, learning and training in the areas of nutrition; and public-private partnerships, focused on eradicating obesity.” http://bit.ly/2F5d8jO (pg. 7)New co-pres. John DeSimone went further:“This fund represents incremental investments for the China business and is equal in size to the China grant monies the company has already received and called out in our prior earnings calls and public filings.” (ibid. pg. 11)Yet Herbalife’s August, 2016 Investor Presentation revealed that $28.9 million of Chinese grant monies had already been spent. http://bit.ly/2G0iafv (pg. 37) The Company’s May, 2017 Investor Presentation reflected the expenditure of another $74.1 million of Chinese grant monies. http://bit.ly/2D5WStU (pg. 31)So, was Herbalife’s trumpeted return of $90 million in grant monies from the Chinese government within three months of that government’s closure of its sweeping MLM reforms without implicating Herbalife a serendipitous coincidence; or was it a well concealed bribe?While Herbalife seems to have escaped official sanction by the Chinese, the SEC and DOJ are still investigating the company for FCPA violations in China (the FCPA prohibits bribery and/or improper payments). http://hrbl.me/2y0w9kO (pp.27 & 28) I’m pretty sure those U.S. Agencies will soon sweep this development into their investigations (if they haven’t already); and if they confirm a violation this significant, their sanctions could put Herbalife out of business in the U.S. as well as China.Congratulations to the $HLF longs on their success. I just hope they’re aware of the hazards that still lie ahead for a predatory fraud which relies on an irrational sales and distribution model (MLM) to fuel its ill-gotten gains.",
"To show how “ridiculous” Icahn’s claim is that Herbalife competitors, from a corporate standpoint, have ""great barriers to entry"" you selectively pull one sentence from an entire section of their 10k dealing with industry competition. However, the previous paragraph from the one you cherry picked from dealt with “other network marketing organizations” (where several of these “competitors” are identified by name), but the one you quoted out of context was specifically addressing the ease of entry (and exit) of distributors. This is made clear by the very next sentence that you conveniently left out which states, “…the fact that our Members may easily enter and exit our network marketing program contributes to the level of competition that we face.”Next you imply Icahn could be operating counter to FTC guidance by claiming Herbalife, which had 2,500 employees in 2006, 5,100 in 2011, and over 8,000 employees today, “creates jobs”. Then you mock Icahn’s view of Herbalife as a “growth company” by highlighting a small Q4 drop in an Herbalife specific metric called “Volume Points”, which has little relevance to Herbalife’s overall sales – which grew in Q4, 2017 both Yr/Yr as well as consecutively, as they’ve done in three of the last four quarters in spite of operating under both Ackman’s attacks and the FTC’s consent order. But what is most disingenuous is your attempt at misdirection within the 10-Q segment you added by directing our attention only to the most recent Net Loss and negative Earnings Per Share figures. First, why not use the “Quarterly Results of Operations” within Herbalife’s actual 10-K filed with the SEC? Perhaps because it also reveals their recent Net Sales growth trend? Or that they have been substantially profitable in the five previous quarters, or in the previous 51 consecutive quarters? Or that Q2, 2017 – the quarter in which the FTC’s order went into effect – was the third most profitable quarter in their history? This also begs the question, do you really believe that a company’s net income or earning per share for a single quarter is indicative of their overall growth? Do you really not understand why Herbalife experiences a Net Loss in Q4 of $63.4 million in spite for their Gross Profits increasing by $34.6 million? You do know that there can be occasional, exceptional occurrences that can cause a growing company to experience a one-time expense increase, right? Like, for example, that $137.6 million increase in Income Taxes? Since you chose not to include the text related to that 4th footnote, allow me to explain. This was due to the impact of the U.S. Tax Reform (enacted during Q4, 2017) which “creating a modified territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries” (HLF 2017 10-K, page 117). Less this one-time tax payment Herbalife’s Net Income last quarter would have increased by 65% to $89.9 million.",

"Excellent.Given their relative performance the last 2 years, it's not clear to me why WDC continues to lag STX's valuation.  WDC has been growing faster and is better positioned competitively, yet somehow it sells at a much lower multiple on FY18 earns (6.8x vs 11.5x for STX) despite much faster earnings growth this past year (52% vs 18%)..  For FY19, WDC's eps is expected to decline by 10% from $14.01 to $12.59, while STX's is expected to be flat at $4.89.  It's not clear why WDC under-performs STX here given WDC""s competitive advantages and recent outperformance.  But let's say those estimates come to pass.  Even if WDC's earnings decline to $12.59 next year, if the stock was given the same multiple as STX (11.5x), we'd be talking about a $145 stock.  If we just split the difference, it's a $120 stock.I personally think analysts are underestimating continuing cost synergies, not to mention the interest savings you mention.  So here's some fantasy math -- WDC performs at least as well as STX next year (flat earnings) AND gets the same multiple that STX sells for.  That means $14.01 X 11.5 = $161.

FEYE will likely be acquired this year. Stay long.,
HPQ is looking at FEYE,
"I own Fire Eye stock for last two years, their forecasts for this year is double digit growth, 10% would be the most negative view and thus that seems to be your view based on your article. Fire Eyes new products including Helix, refresh opportunities, new Resellers, targeting mid-size businesses all points to increased revenue. Mandiant revenue in past quarter is a great pointer to future revenues for products in the rolling 1-2 quarters. Mandiant last quarter had a record quarter which points to knock on product sales over coming quarters.",
"A nothing article if you ask me. Fireeye expects to get back to double figure growth this year, the signs the last few quarters is just that. I think it will be 15-20%+. If they achieve this and keep their expenses low then there they will be in a healthy profitable company in one of the few high growth sectors in IT. I would not be surprised if they get to 20% growth to see this stock at $40+ this year. What Cisco/IBM/Microsoft would not want their products, Mandiant would ensure whoever buys Fireeye to have an edge, I expect a buyout this year",
"I don't understand this article.  Clearly, FEYE has just really started to capitalize its new subscription model and continue with operating cost improvements, while margin growth is also in the cards. They are consistently hitting set goals and as cybersecurity valuations go FEYE is still substantially undervalued on an FTM basis and should again achieve a 30 price per share next 6 to 12 months. That is if they don't get acquired before then, which is very likely.",
"I looked at the charts, and if you like Elliot wave, it just entering the third wave, which 'seem' to indicate that even in the short term, FEYE is more likely to go up than down.  Other charts also confirm this trend, but these are only charts and may mean nothing. The author has probably dug deep into the fundamentals and would probably know more.",

In my opinion that is a shame because there are some incredibly smart and hardworking Chinese people who deserve the same rights of freedom of expression that we have in western countries.

"@kevn,your response makes allot of sense. thanks.  I'm surprised, though, with all the future uncertainty, that shares get bid up to discount the ideal case.  That said, I PEG of 1 is not out of line with a more cautious pricing.re ""Growth: Don't know where the 7% is from. Nasdaq says next 5 yr is 14.85%. ""curious.  I got that from Yahoo Finance.  I see your Nasdaq cite, but if you look more closely the forecast assumption is for ~70% growth this year then negative growth all the years following.I've never seen such a thing, which seems like a red flag re company competitive and/or biz model health. I guess your saying "" I think the crux here is how cyclical will the business be and if it is when does the downtrend begin. This is something that is highly debated in this segment and as you can see continues to be pushed out."" explains that.http://bit.ly/2tKSWj4",
"Growth:  Don't know where the 7% is from.  Nasdaq says next 5 yr is 14.85%.  On CNBC chart when look at earnings it shows for next 3-5 yrs at 43.7% (obviously that is not happening).  I think that 7% may be an older number as many analyst believed the cycle was to end of'18 (was in '17), now saying 2020.  As a result you have seen in the last week the estimates by those analysts increase significantly.  I think the crux here is how cyclical will the business be and if it is when does the downtrend begin.  This is something that is highly debated in this segment and as you can see continues to be pushed out.  Even the LRCX CEO has said ""it is different this time"".  Evaluating other companies that are in or touch this segment, this appears to be highly accurate.   Looking at their presentation.  LRCX currently has 21% of the market, which is growing, and by 2021 expects to have 27%.   That is a big WOW there.   With AI and IoT both growing rapidly this segment is exploding and has not come close to peaking.  It will be volatile (stock prices) allowing for much trading if you want or a buy and hold strategy.  LRCX has conservatively estimated $24 ($23-$25) EPS in 2021 with flat WFE to 2018.  FCF - yes the stock is up since the announcement.  But you can't take that in a vacuum.  The bigger picture is the company is growing and the results is providing the opportunity to increase this distribution.  Thus the performance and future performance is what is driving the stock, not necessarily the shareholder return which is an outcome of the performance.   Not saying it doesn't hurt and probably added additional investors, but it is not THE driver.  They do plan to return 50% of FCF over the next 5 years, signifying outstanding opportunities.Furthermore, even with the upside that has occurred with excellent earnings, a show of confidence in the future by mgmt, the stock has not even reached its 52-week high.  A fwd PE is 13.5.  I think growth is way above 7% as does LRCX mgmt.   So the fwd PE for me is below its growth rate.  Buy/sell/hold:  I answered this above.  It is not a static number.  There is no answer to this as there are really too many variables.  It is not IF or WHEN, but WHY.   The WHY is intertwined with the decision on valuation as it goes into my equation in determining valuation.  If my perceived value continues to increase over time, then my PT won't be met.  Like I said, it is not static.  But lets say there is no change I am aware of, etc and the stock moves up to $275 in 40 days.  Then yes I probably take 50% off the table, maybe more.  It is not black and white.  It is not simply science, but part science and part art, if you will.",
"seems like the author might be looking too much at the rear view mirror re "" For a high-growth company with a solid client base and tremendous shipment numbers to continue selling off for no real reason is unjustified.""; that is, the average analyst expects Lam's next 5 yr sales growth to be only 7%, by far not the 40+% of years past.which makes these ""targets"" pipe dreams:""The stock should hit $237.63 at some point this year, a 15x multiple was applied to the valuation — this is an average multiple, and if we apply a 20x multiple, we get a target of $316.84; the stock trades now with a 20x EPS.""as that would be a PEG of ~2 an 3, respectively , which is VERY expensive, for an expected non-growth stock.",

At a PE of 27x I’m not sure it’s “cheap”. It’s still a box retailer with a undeniable growing online presence. That will be an uphill battle against AMZN in the US but Walmart is also making large investments in foreign companies in materially same businesses like JD and Flip.,

"Nice job Simon. You covered ADMA's complete recent scenario. And thanks for interesting plasma market and industry information. Pretty much in line with ADMA's latest webcast on Monday.Btw.. ADMA's CEO was asked on his webcast about his estimate on RI-002 future revenues.. He said that hyper-immune products like Nabi-HB were sold for $500-700 per gram. He also said that the 400,000 liter capacity fractionation facility was generating 80-90 mill./year prior to the FDA's warning letter. And that with ADMA as is today, they could obviously generate considerably more in revenue.Sounds good. I keep my shares :D",

"AnonymousVAT is a sales tax levied on all sales inside the EU, so it would apply to all EU made steel as well, or for that matter Chinese steel coming into the EU. It can be offset against any purchases Nucor makes inside the EU, which are also liable for VAT ( virtually everything has VAT levied on it).From memory Florida has a 6% sales tax- this is not levied on steel sales from Pennsylvania?",
Maybe the EU will pot a tariff on every dollar the US government sends to NATO!,
"The CEO of Nucor's argument about VAT is completely fallacious. VAT on EU manufactured steel would not be chargeable if the steel were exported to the US. If it were sold to a US company with a subsidiary inside the EU, that company would be registered for tax in the EU and could offset the input VAT against its output VAT.A tariff on the other hand is a tax charge that in effect occurs between tax regimes and is non-recoverable.",The Bear Case On Tariffs Is Not Strong - Cramer's Mad Money (3/5/18)

OK - so that leaves the door wide open for Cassiopea (SWX SKIN) to take over the acne market if their Phase 3 acne trial is successful.  The results are due out in Q2 2018.,
"This failure and the subsequent termination of further development of the drug speaks volumes of how expensive for a single successful drug to be put on the market.  Those complaining about the high drug price have little understanding how arduous a process and how costly for drug cos to get FDA approval to put a drug on the market.  As to Dermira, the drop of share price is overdone and at this level, it will be a reasonable risk/reward proposition in view of its strong finance and the upcoming FDA decision in mid year on its second drug.

Hi Jonathan.. any hope here?,
"It would be helpful to have someone's analysis of this company's takeout value.  With a tiny pipeline outside of this truly exciting drug, it would seem logical that GTX would be fielding offers from larger pharma in this space.  There's a significant # of unvested options that would mature at that point.  So, what's it worth if it accepts an offer BEFORE the 4th Q's topline results in this phase 2 trial?  Obviously, it's worth a healthy multiple X the current $500m if it successfully rides enobosarm through phase 3, but this company -- that has seen promising drugs fail in advanced testing for prostate cancer and breast cancer -- may prefer to hedge.",

This stock could have institutions on the bid for a long time given GTXI's current market cap and peak sales estimates (which I have no idea of but would have to be massive).
