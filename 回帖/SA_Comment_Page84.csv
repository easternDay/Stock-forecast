Interesting question. If one believes the prospects for HAL and SLB are poor the outlook for oil prices should be strong on reduced NA drilling. For some reason these stocks are trading WITH oil producers though. Makes no sense.,

good article. I won't be touching this one. Tempted to buy puts,
It isn’t that complicated. The surety bond providers can demand more collateral if they determine they need it based on their risk assessment of CLD. The only thing that is complicated is to know when they might ask for more. What is clear is that it won’t take much for CLD to be a company without a credit agreement and potentially in a  liquidity crunch that likely leads to chapter 11 if the surety bond providers want more collateral.,
"atleast with BK announcement, there had been a Kick back after dropping from $2. But with this price of $.28 😂😂😂 I guess BK call won't do much for a Kick back...0.11 to 0.15 maybe lol. I really hope they sell some of their assets to go a little better at the S.P.",
too complicated,
"To know how this story will start in terms of a cap. structure reshuffling, CLD will have to address its single largest liquidity / capital structure risk. From their Sept. 10-Q: “As of September 30, 2018, we had $407.6 million of reclamation and lease bonds with underwriters backed by collateral of approximately 5%, or $22.0 million, in the form of letters of credit under our A/R Securitization Program. The terms and conditions with the issuers of the surety bonds allow for collateral calls to mitigate their exposure. The amount of collateral that could be required under these collateral calls would be based on the underlying bonded assets and their risks, our credit profile, and overall market conditions. Should further collateral for these obligations be called, this could utilize a significant portion of our existing liquidity or potentially exceed our existing liquidity. If we are unable to obtain or retain required surety bonds, we may be unable to satisfy legal requirements necessary to conduct our mining operations.” If the surety bond holders ask for more collateral of any significance, the game is likely over and they enter chapter 11. It is pretty shocking that they have this little posted given their current state but my guess is that there are heated discussions ongoing behind the scenes.",
Existing contracts would be unaffected. New contracts might be impaired.,
"I thought about this discussion last night (New Year’s Eve; awful. I’m getting old) and it occurred to me Cloud Peak will likely have a difficult time selling their coal into the domestic market for new business for longer term (>6 months)because of the threat of bankruptcy without discounting their prices relative to Peabody and Arch from their PRB operations.  This becomes more difficult when both of those companies have lower production costs due in large measure to higher volumes.I think most utilities will be reluctant to enter into contracts without some upfront incentive (lower prices) to offset any potential contract issues associated with a bankruptcy filing. I doubt if spot purchasing decisions will be affected, however.So it makes it more difficult for a market uptick to aid Cloud Peak’s financial position. It’s a shame really.Anyway Happy New Year to all!",
"Ok.  I voiced some disagreements earlier in the thread about the comps and another commentator who was skeptical of the reclamation bonding.Here is my narrative now.  No the equity isn't shot.  But if the 2024 bonds are a potential 4 bagger, then equity had to reduce to a price even greater than a 4 bagger.  Right now, they have the ""potential"" to be a 10 bagger if CLD can sell the whole company for $600M, which is possible, though obviously risky.Let me explain why it's possible.  Using Michael Boyd's number of $17M in operational cashflow minus CAPEX for 9 months ending Sep 30, we have to adjust for the weather losses in Q2 that dragged into Q3.  It prevented them from producing 2M tons of coal at a profit margin of $1, and was a significant factor in raising average cost of 13M tons by $1.50.  My estimate is that this impacted cashflow by $15M to $20M.So add $15M to the $17M cashflow from the finacials.  That's $32M.  Then multiply that by 1.33 to account for the missing 4Q.  That gets us to $40M cashflow.  Remember, we're at the bottom of a cycle here.  This could easily increase if coal goes up in value.But let's just say they only earn $30M cashflow going forward.  Mine depletions, cost increases, underdevelopment, and whatnot.  In the 3 years it takes to reach the 2021 bond maturity, they will have generated $90M.If they pay off their 2021s, at say 70% par, using that $90M, then that eliminates $127M debt plus $15M interest expense.  So they only have $223M debt going forward with a new $45M cashflow rather than the current $30M in my example.  Could they roll over at this point, considering they also have liquidity of $130M?  Yes.This only assumes things remain the same, which is bleak.Would someone want to acquire this?  Yes.  For one, it would be debt free going forward and they'll have the option to suspend production until prices increase.  Debt free, cash flow generation is $70-$80M with current prices at the bottom cycle.  But they could sit on it.For the bond holders, they have the added benefit of receiving 75% of their money back in interest, until 2021.",
"Can anyone who has read the indentures and spoken with the company spell out the debt structure for me here?  I've seen a lot of market mispricing over the past 20 years, but legit senior debt is trading at a discount to junior debt for no good reason in a hugely troubled company would be a first.  The market makes lots of mistakes, but I've never seen it make that one, and it would be so easy to arbitrage away by buying the senior debt and shorting the junior.  It only takes one hedge fund to notice and poof, it's gone.The second lien notes are due sooner, so maybe the issue is that the company will issue new even more senior debt to pay them, at a giant discount?  Then the 6% debt would become the most junior.  Could that be it?",
"@Michael Boyd I appreciate your analysis.  You're always dilligent, thorough, and professional.  I'm not in complete agreement, though, regarding your comps.I think you've failed to take them in their proper context.Let me add one more for you, which you didn't mention in the article.Contura Energy (CTRA) sold 2 mines in the PRB (the exact same area as CLD operates) in 2017.  Their total reserves were about 600 metric tons.  They sold them for $50M, which is pathetic.  Your comps in the article also imply the mines aren't worth very much.But here's the missing context.  Which I gleaned from CTRA.  In making their dismal $50M disposition, CTRA generated income tax deductions of approximately $400M.  CTRA, like many coal miners, are post BK companies.  They suddenly have low debt and lots of free cashflow.  Selling their most troubled assets are a great way to reduce taxes on their suddenly massive free cashflow.And that is the missing context.  The comps were created at a time when these companies were incentivized to sell underperforming mines, all at once, in order to realize tax losses, and they didn't really care too much about the price they sold because the tax deductions were significantly greater.  Add to it that their shares are generally undervalued post-BK, extra free cashflow is great for buybacks.So your comps were unnaturally biased downward when they normally would not be.  This industry just recently suffered major bankruptcies.  Those dispositions do not reflect intrinsic value, only temporary opportunities for brilliant financial maneauvers.These companies were smart to do all this.  But it created an unnaturally low market for these mines.",
Cloud Peak’s balance sheet dated 9/30/18 has Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) in their liabilities section of $108.4 million. I am assuming this ARO line item encompasses their reclamation liabilities. This amount seems very low for three surface mines. The most recent 10Q says they have $407.6 million in reclamation and lease bonds off balance sheet.Could the significantly lower ARO pose a near term problem or is this just a “kick the can down the road” situation?,

"What about exports: seekingalpha.com/...Indian Imports A Growing Tailwind To Maritime Trade	     	Dec. 27, 2018 seekingalpha.com/...	The big bright spot for Cloud Peak is international sales. Here, the company has export contracts of 5.5 million tons p.a. via Westshore Terminals, Canada. This amount will increase to 10.5 million tons in 2021 and 2022. In addition, CLD has signed the delivery of more than one million tons (JERA) to Japan from 2020 onwards, increasing the exported coal volume to 11.5 million tons by 2022. Up to now, export earnings have been barely visible as only $5.46 cash margin per ton was generated on exported coal last quarter and even less before.",

Now if power were to turn around this year and at least break even with a positive trend that would be a great harbinger of things to come, unfortunately I don’t have enough insight into how much the Alstom overhang will work against that outcome.

"WG I have to challenge the idea that the conglomerate model is no longer viewed in a positive light. How does the market view Danaher? Also what would you call Amazon. Let’s see it now owns Whole Foods, has a cloud business, is a wholesaler of just about everything, makes electronic parts for the home, owns both a trucking company and a fleet of Cargo planes and provides a web service for third party sellers. How about Walgreen’s buying a health insurance company or Comcast buying NBC? For that matter companies like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics are conglomerates if you peel back their current composition. Lockheed bought  General Dynanics’ F16 business, Merged with Martin Matietta, which had bought GE’s aerospace business. Then the company bought Loral which itself had bought the defense business of several companies including that of IBM and Ford.  Raytheon has a similar history by buying among others a Florida company which was in the military  radio business, and General Dynamics bought a software company. Each of these has bought a commercial airplane manufacturer. I think the market favors any company that is increasing profit and/ or dividends. If that company happens to be a conglomerate it is favored,. If the conglomerate is in trouble and has decreasing profit and / or dividends  the “ market” seeks to ascribe the reasons. One that is in vogue today is the Conglomerate model. From my point of view, when the “market” was cheering Immelt’s efforts to buy Alstom and then after the acquisition extolled what a coup it was didn’t  assess the result  obviously as the conglomerate structure being out of favor. Let’s all agree if a conglomerate is managed badly it should be out of favor and if it is managed well it should be in favor. Might we say the same for any business?",

"If GE spins off the Healthcare unit then GE is a buy, but if they decide to do an IPO then there is no benefit in owning the stock.",
"Sell the winners, keep most of the losers, greatly simplifies the management and turns GE around. Sounds silly on its face. Don’t believe that the sales of well managed businesses simplifies the complexity of managing power with the Alstom’s poison pill in the mix. Also the management of oil and gas seems not to have been able to profit by oil being 60/ barrel or more for most of 2018. If one looks at renewables the profit is approaching zero even as revenue increases. I suppose selling Healthcare and Transportation will therefore simplify  the management of renewables. Obviously Aviation has excellent management and needs no help from the corporate staff. I think the complexity argument is pure rationalization. Let’s face it, if power can’t be fixed, GE stock will not rise. Selling two well-managed profitable businesses to simplify complexity is pure Humbug. The company is reacting to the financial community which claims the sky is falling because the company is too leveraged. Whether it is better served to reduce debt by selling or spinning off profitable businesses is a trade-off and seems like a short-sighted solution. At least one other strategy is available, slowly decrease debt, get capable management at power, keep  healthcare,  understand why renewables is not very profitable( that is it really a viable business if not sell it to a group who believes it can be) sell off oil and gas and create a comprehensive plan for digital and additive manufacturing. We’ll see if the plan announced succeeds. If it does all well and good, but rationalizing actions for what are questionable reasons doesn’t do it.",

After a year the new company will triple in value but the GE shareholder won't benefit.

The spinoff is almost certainly going to take some of GE’s pension obligations.5.  Spinoffs have a history of performing better once released6.  Healthcare is rock solid with a high profit margin and steady revenues.  It will be able to issue or refi debt at lower rates than GE can.7.  More than enough GE debt will be repaid to take away any concern of dilution or a junk bond rating.This is going to happen.  The only thing that might stop it is a really bad IPO market.

"GNC is ultimately a zero - bankruptcy.The company blew $1.7B on share buybacks at an average of about $37/share. Today, shares are worth $35/share less - that is about $1.6B of (shareholder) cash that has been torched! ARO did similar - $1B share repurchase at an average of $16/share while having no debt, and was regretting it when their shares were well below $1 and they needed to take on debt just to keep the doors open a bit longer. GNC will be exactly the same.And, wouldn't you know it, company now has 15 million new outstanding shares on the balance sheet over the past year. BRILLIANT! Purchase shares at an average of $35 and then reissue down below $5. Buy high, sell low - GENIUS!The company is saddled with $1B of debt, and has declining sales. Wouldn't it be wonderful to have that $1.7B cash from the buybacks?Shares are going sub-$2 in 2019, and ultimately sub-$1.The valuation here is ridiculous - one big financial shell game and sorry to say, common shareholders are the losers.",

"4 out of the last 17 years BA provided no dividend raise.  You'll need to average a 14.4% dividend raise for 10 years to get a 10% YOC for Boeing.  So I think that is way too cyclical to provide you with that consistent growth you're looking for. Blackrock needs a 12% avg increase over the next 10 years to achieve that.  They've had single digit raises the last two years and froze their dividend once.  So that is really unlikely as well IMO.HD needs to increase by 15.3% over the next years to give you a YOC of 10% in 2029.  Forget that, they froze or nearly froze for 3 straight years in last recession.Your goal is unrealistic and you're going to be disappointed.  Moreover, a company can only increase their dividend growth rate higher than their earnings rate for so long and the current estimates for earnings growth don't include recessions.",
That's a pretty aggressive goal get to 10% YOC in 10 years.  Something like a starting 4% yield that grows 10% per year.  Not too many stocks are going to do that.  Curious what you are investing in that you think will provide a 10% YOC in 10 years?,
"How does one assess fair value?  For  me, an investor looking  for income, a yield-on-cost of 10% in ten years is just fine.  But ROST falls far short of this goal.  Its current dividend yield of ~ 1.10%, combined with  a forward dividend CAGR of 19% (its 3 and 5 year CAGRs) produces a YOC of less than 7%. The dividend  increased 23% over he past four quarters, which seems unsustainable in the long run.  If we take the CAGR over the previous 4 years as more likely, i.e. 12%, the YOC in ten years would be an unsatisfactory (to me) YOC of under 4%.So, ROST needs to come down even more in price before I would consider it. Because it fails  my arithmetic test, I haven’t looked further into the fundamentals to determine whether ROST is a company I could consider holding “for ever”.",

Everyone on seeking alpha loves SWN. I am trying to figure why. They won’t be positive cash flow till 2021. Their debt levels will rise with capex and stock buyback included. Not much risk here but unless strip prices rise I don’t see much upside higher than 4-5.,
AR has some great assets but the one thing that really concerns me is their level of debt and the increase of debt the last few years. They are not investment grade so the rating agencies agree. I have no idea what prices will do even though many people think they can forecast them. But if prices stay so lower for longer they might have some issues. They need to sell all their equity ownership in AM and pay off a couple billon of debt. 300 million from one time payment and 1.5 billion in equity ownership. Then I believe the stock would be a moon shot in the next cycle up. Thanks,
"I agree that the whole sector is beat up but, I would make a case that there is more room to fall for AR, RRC, COG, EQT when you look at the value of SWN. Every time I look at investing at one of the aforementioned companies, I go back and look at the current value of SWN and just have to buy more of that instead. SWN's production is valued so much lower than everyone else (except GPOR). Correct me if I'm wrong, but Antero has always been one step ahead with their hedge book and thus realized higher prices than everyone else. How long can we expect that to continue? I tend to think that playing field will be leveled in the future and everyone will more or less be living in the same price environment.

"You miss one critical aspect of ENDO.  That is the analysts do not seem to understand the company's earnings potential as shown by the fact that they consistently underestimate ENDO's quarterly earnings even after the quarter is actually over.  To be specific for at least each of  the past nine quarters (that is all I have data for) the final analysts estimate has underestimated earnings with the underestimate averaging over 27%.  How important is that?  Well analysts now estimate next year's earnings at $2.73, but if they continue to underestimate by 27% the actual earnings would be above $3.45.  Surely that is material in thinking about the 2019 stock price. (if you are interested I can be reached at mrappeport@yahoo.com)",

Once the opioid issue is quantified in terms of real dollar settlement.  I expect a big pharma to swoop in and try to take them out at around 20 - 25 bucks a share.

"Misinformation from Self-Interested Market Participants Does Not Change the Merits of the Premium OfferCertain market participants have spread misinformation related to Green Growth with the objective of destroying value in Aphria. This misinformation was generated by comments from those with a stated short position in Aphria and whose trade will be impeded by Green Growth’s premium offer. Shareholders should be aware of the facts related to a number of incorrect statements made. Specifically:Green Growth has confirmed the Schottenstein family does not own Aphria shares. The Schottensteins applied for a cultivation, processing and dispensary license with an affiliate of Aphria, Liberty Health Sciences, in the state of Ohio. The venture was awarded a processing and dispensary provisional license in Ohio. At such time that state law permits transfers, the JV will be dissolved. Subsequent to making the application in Ohio, Aphria divested its interest in Liberty Health Sciences.Shawn Dym is not a director on Green Growth’s board.",
I live in Georgia I was referring to cost of doing business in canada,
Haha Steeley got a good laugh from that one 😆 I’ve seen you post on here often SA and follow your comments....what are your thoughts on this sell off and outlook for next 6-12 months if you don’t mind me asking?,
with gas for cars at over $5 a gallon and high taxes not sure how these canadian companies make money,
"@johnwilson yes it can definitely go lower but your quoting aphria after its market cap got knocked nearly 60% in a week... yes it’s up alittle from there but they took there hit.... and to be honest I believe they deserved it but from here on out with a new independent chairman of board and diageo members on board I think risk is priced in mostly for what Canadian asssets are worth and potential with there production.....GMP Martin landry just came out with buy and reflected exact sentiment with 100 bps increase in discount rate due to risk .... and I get it you keep saying how little nueevra and LATAM is worth and I understand the worry but if you really look into auroras and canopy’s assets in LATAM it’s not remarkable they look similar to aphrias......okay so maybe 700 million assets are actually worth 250 million that is extremely messed up but it doesn’t necessarily mean there stock has nothing good going if you can’t look past corporate governance issue than I understand as an investor there are less murky waters to join ( organigram, hexo, canntrust, aurora, canopy, cronos and I know Cronos has Altria investment and that is awesome but if you compare aphrias Canadian assets to cronos it’s not close...cronos is really overvalued I believe next couple of earnings reports will not look bright compared to their current valuation",
No difference between stockhouse and seeking alpha - its a bunch of fools there and a bunch of sophisticated-appearing fools here.,
Unbelievable that some are still holding on to these shares...this takeout offer is a total scam.,
"The new board should help. Separating ceo and chairman is definitely a good idea. As for the GGB company. So what that they have experienced CPG leaders, the offer for aphria is a joke.",
"So does everyone discount the legitimacy coming onto aphrias board? Tom looney and Jacob ripshtein and the new independent chair announced the other day are well respected CPG executives/directors and they are joining aphria so obviously they see something, why would they be joining a complete shit show if they really believed it was on fire and about to burn to the ground what would be the point for their careers/image.... why is that so heavily discounted, no one often discusses it? I own aphria and I agree that nuveera and LATAM look extremely sketchy lack of disclosure and insider dealings... Andy Defransco looks to be shady and not a bright spot for aphria yet has anyone looked at their Price to book and PE at current prices? yes aphria will have a heavy risk premium added to valuation going forward due to their corporate governance but you are not going to sit here and tell me their Canadian operations are not marvelous.... low cost production, state of art automation, broken coast top brand out there, southern glazers distribution deal, 255 kg production online early 2019, it is very unfortunate if directors were making shell acquisitions to put money in their pockets but for Hindenburg to say this company is worth 0 per share is ridiculous only exaggerating and pushing the narrative to benefit their own position I agree aphria isn’t what they could have been due to all the BS dealings but Vic neufield does appear to know business he grew Jamesion into a good company and he know what he’s doing ( business strategy wise, not necessarily shareholder wise) and I understand he very well may be a complete scumbag but I simply believe there is too much value here.... I want aphria to dip back to 5.50 USD and I will average down.... let me put it this way for all these people thinking aphria will burn to the ground... if aphria were ever to dip down to 3.50 or 4 USD, say if this board review comes out in a couple weeks and says that the LATAM assets are worth nothing and demand Vic step down (or something wild like that) Canopy would be out of there mind crazy not to step in and use some of their cash war chest to buy aphrias Canadian assets in a hostile takeover..... they could get 255 KG of production for what? 1 or 1.5 billion... then they eliminate a top three producer and definitely solifdy spot as #1 LP over aurora not that I don’t think CGC already has/is #1..... just all my thoughts and would love honest feedback... good luck to all investing",
"I don't know if it's a total scam or not.  My bet is it will be over $2.50 at April options expiration so sold the 2.5 puts while I wait for market to calm down.  This may be a tough 2019 for stocks, or we may go to ATH.  I doubt APHA will drop 60% in 4 months.",
Vic Neufeld should be investigated and prove himself as “not guilty”.,
Looks like there is another offer on ghe table,
"aphria last qtr reported c$13m, wonder what from",
the aphria stench just keeps going,
I sold some April $2.5 puts on APHA.  What happens to these if the buyout happens before April?  Just vanish and I keep premium? I doubt this ever gets to $2.5 on the downside.,
How about this....create your own merger. Sell Aphria and buy 2 shares Organigram or 1.5 shares Canntrust. No need to stick around for funny money.,

Thick Vic reminds me of Mr.Burns son from the Simpsons,
Thick Vic is up to something,
"Even though the proposed deal positions GGP as the acquirer, it is essentially Aphria shareholders acquiring a company with little to no value at a greatly inflated price - largely to the benefit of parties related to Aphria. In the end, the effect would be to dilute existing Aphria shareholders by about 50% with little improvement in the underlying assets of the business.Hindenburg, albeit they are writing for their own book, has performed a useful role in bringing to light important information on this and other Aphria deals which can only be explained by corporate corruption, and should be respected for that. Also, judging from some of the comments to this article, many have no experience with the types of transactions at issue and the sorts of scams that can occur, and can learn from the work of companies like Hindenburg.Having been involved in many corporate acquisitions, I can say that Aphria, because of its track record on buying assets at inflated prices, enriching related parties, the apparent lack of integrity of the BOD, and the class action litigation that is underway, is toxic and unlikely to be acquired by any large player in the tobacco or alcoholic beverage industry. It would be a career-ending move for any executive team in a major company to acquire a company like Aphria and have to deal with the mess that follows.",
"For those who still believe, I get it. But what about the shell company in Vic’s wife’s name... used to buy property, mark it up millions, and resell it to Aphria 2 weeks later?   This is a documented fact. And it’s not like Vic was like, “oops...  my wife accidentally cost us over 2 million dollars, here is the money back.”  You just can’t explain that away. You just can’t. Imagine if Mark Zuckerberg’s wife, friends, and other companies he owned started profiting (on the sly) at the expense of Facebook. Their shareholders would go NUTS. NUTS!! It would be legendary.  Too many other good opportunities out there to even think about this.",
Is there an investigative authority similar to SEC in Canada that is or should be investigating Aphria?  Seems like they should be investigated and if the short fund reports are true people should go to jail.  Any status on an investigation?,
"Brazen, indeed.  Is it legal to short a company that I am convinced is a scam? It’s too bad because Aphria does have good assets and market share. This Vic guy is shady and as a result, I don’t see why there are any investors left with trust in this company. For example, APHA skyrockets after its “shell game” is exposed, yet companies like HEXO stagnate while doing well.Baffling.",

A disection of Aphria's Canadian assets and financials would seem in order given the author's attention to this information outside of Canada. What am I missing why this is apparently not relevant?,

I find it comical and sad at the same time that people still defend APHA regardless of how much evidence is presented they're so bias/blind that they do not see it or simply ignore it. Mind boggling really.,
"Being short APHA at this time is like being caught up a creek without a paddle, eh!",
"Wow, would be hard to make this up even if one tried! Absolutely incredible!",
Great article it puts everything into perspective Thanks Hindenburg for your research after your first article came out sold my substantial positions in APHRIA and LHSIF and saved a ton of money. Reinvested in CGC and CRONOS APHRIA management is desperate and trying to bailout but its too late.What all these shenanigans do is to move investors to solid companies with a great future.,
"This post is entirely my opinion, but it sounds like a lot of self-comforting long talk on here. I was reading through the report yesterday from Scotiabank, I'm still not convinced. Throw Neufeld's shuffling around into the mix, and the offer does not appear to have been genuine and might have served to get insiders out a a better price at, as usual, the expense of small investors. This company stinks to high heaven. Why gamble on it when there are thousands of other reputable companies to consider?",
Desperation has reared its ugly head once again. Innuendo is no way to make an informed decision. Too much nonsense in this report that is twisted nefariously in yet another easily debunked attack. You should spend more time defending your lawsuits.,
I'm out...apha management could have easily rebutted the interlocking accusations weeks ago. That they didn't is all you need to know. Where do I go to join in the law suits?,

GGB hasn’t done anything but cast a negative light. Their self serving statements about being retail geniuses would fly better if they were making a move on MedMen.,
This isn’t good for aphria‘s reputation in the short term. They better show good growth in January to shut up the noise. Thanks for the article cornerstone.,
"First, thanks Cornerstone for your article and getting it out so promptly.As you say, this is probably an attempt by GGB to gain some profile, which it needs in order to raise capital because it is essentially insolvent. The last financials, Sept 30th, show a company with few tangible assets, little revenue, negative operating cash flow, about $50MM in working cap deficiency and a going concern note. Since then, the company did a reverse takeover to add some assets, stay alive, perhaps restructure some of its debt and get a public listing but it is still a business with very little substance or operating cash flow relative to its market cap.",

So far, they seem to be making all the right moves. They haven't gotten 100% of Hulu yet so they can use that as their grownup content arm, but they know they need it. Or, if Comcast is playing spoiler, they need to build a Hulu substitute but that Plan B is a ways off if it ever emerges.AT&T could blow it, but Disney?

"Can this roundtable intelligently address the ongoing antibiotics stock conundrum…Positive:1) Governments and health organizations seem to urgently want new antibiotics to fight resistant bacteria.2) Sell-side analysts are overwhelming bullish on most antibiotic stocks with extremely high target prices, even as the stocks continue to tank.Negative:1) Antibiotic stocks have been going down, down, down for the last couple of years, even on good news and drug approvals.2) Big pharma shows no interest in buying the small clinical stage biopharma companies and some have even sold their own internal antibiotic programs.So, how is this conundrum ultimately resolved? Will the stocks eventually rebound or will the shorts be proven correct over time? It seems to me that more and more new antibiotics will be necessary to fight the resistant bugs but the health care sector doesn’t want to fund them. Any thoughts and opinions are appreciated. Thanks.",
Thanks for the article and all the participants.  Enjoyable to read the multiple responces in one place.  Would like to read more roundtable discussions in the future.,
"Christmas over. Market closed. Weather not so nice. Seems like a good time to reflect on the years investment progress. For me it has been very good with total portfolio gains of 192%. And that portfolio normally consists of about 95% SMALL biotechs. Since one of the top biotech mutual funds Fidelity Select Biotech had total returns of -12.69%, I have to feel pretty good about my performance. Not trying to be braggadocio but just thought I might pass on to other biotech investors some of the things I think can help with performance.1. Nothing is more important than doing substantial research before taking any position.2. Not losing money is as important or even more important than making money. Anyone can look and find any number of biotechs that look like they have the potential to become 5,10 or even 20 baggers. That's great, but if those same stocks have the potential to go down 50% or 70%, you must stay away. With rare exceptions, for me to enter any biotech stock it must not only have multi bagger potential, but the likelihood of it going down more than 15 to 20% must also be miniscule.3. Carefully look at FUNDAMENTALS. Especially CASH & DEBT. Nothing worse than getting hit with big dilutions. And they certainly do happen in biotechs. But they can also be a profit opportunity to start a new position or to add to a favorite if you have great confidence that the dilution will actually help the position in the long run.4. When you find a WINNER, take FULL ADVANTAGE of it. And by that I mean (like many in this article suggested) establish a sizeable core position and then trade around it. No matter how great a stock is in the long run, EVERY stock goes both up & down. Taking advantage of these moves can greatly add to profits. But, especially with biotechs, quick trading should only be attempted by those who can stay on top of the movements full time. Both ups & downs can happen very quickly.5. Buy stocks when they are going up. Almost all of my purchases (especially for trades) are done using Stop Limit Buys or Stop Market Buys. Usually slightly above a substantial number of shares on the ask and ideally with an even greater number of shares on the bid. 6. Finally, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO SELL. Eventually even the greatest stocks at times become close to fully priced or even over priced. When that happens, lighten up or even completely divest. You can always buy a stock back. Even at a higher price if justified.Some of these things say easy but do hard. That's why discipline and not emotion is so important in investing. Hope all have a successful and very profitable 2019.",

"We are close to maximum uncertainty with respect to what could be a transformation triggered by genomic medicines.  Gene editing has the potential to be far more disruptive to established franchises than the pricing narrative that dominated the 2015 selloff.  Genome medicines are still high risk with multiple uncertainty clouds that are lingering from off-targets to immune response. So we end 2018 with what could be considered max uncertainty.  Too little data to derisk these new medicines but enough to question whether patent expiration risk to big pharma is ready to take a backseat to disruption.  Consider just one example for a rare disease.  Elaprase is an enzyme replacement treatment that generated $600m in F17 for Shire.  If the Sangamo data for their Champions study to be released in Feb at WORLD Symposium shows circulating IDS to go with the already reported GAG reduction, this will be the POC that the field needs.  And it will represent a nearer terminal value for the Elaprase franchise.This is not an isolated example.  The launch of HemA gene therapy has the same disruptive potential on a larger scale but BMRN has the Q of durability and ONCE has the issue of immunogenicity.  Both bring uncertainty to the field yet the question of disruption of existing ERT is real and quite large. C19 is the year to watch for genomic medicines as data events are rolled out.  If these medicines do indeed show data to support the hope/hype, the impact on bigpharma can't be overstated.",
Thanks to SA for producing this informative article and asking important questions. And to the contributors (many of whom I follow) for their honest and  varied responses.

"Strong interest in $AMRN. Why is that?As the government renews its attack on pharma and drug pricing in 2019, I would stick to the big players: $PFE, $ABBV, $REGN.See $XBIT. It could be a double.",
Very interesting read. Thanks to SA for organizing this discussion and to the authors for giving detailed/insightful responses,
"AMRN should be acquired by Big Pharma in 2019.Mineral Oil was approved for use by the FDA and is ""inert.""  Had they used Corn Oil or Olive Oil as theplacebo, the same talking heads would have foundthose to be problematic as well.  What is overlookedare all of the studies that look at EPA blood plasmalevels and how they correlate to inversely to events.There is no doubt that Vascepa will become a standardof care drug for CVD.  Big Pharma understands thisand they cannot afford to not have this.  Even AdamFeuerstein understands that Big Pharma should buyAMRN and in fact has suggested that Amgen shouldbuy them.  John Thero rightly believes that Vascepa will be prescribed to patients in the tens of millions.When asked about a possible Big Pharma buyout hesays we'll see how it plays out and that he will do whatis in the best interest of shareholders. Sounds like he'dbe willing to make a deal if the right offer comes along.The CVD indication(s) should be on the label in the 2nd half of 2019, from there they have a 10 year runway beforegenerics come in.  If Big Pharma owns AMRN this will beone of the best selling drugs of all time and will be used totreat many other inflammation related issues (without any negative drug interactions or horrible side effects.)  TheBaker Brothers own a large position in AMRN and myguess is that they are giving informal advice to John Theroon the best way to optimize value for the company.",

Well it sure did.2 weeks ago I changed my tune to: GE will go sideways for a long time, 2 years or more.This stock is dead money folks. Absolutely dead money.Best case, GE will go SIDEWAYS for at least a couple of years.It is a mere ghost of its former self, and the massive debt at ever-higher rates and the pension obligations will always be there.GE is to be avoided at all costs. It is absolutely DEAD MONEY for the foreseeable future.",

"Let us gather round and just put the epitaph on the gravestone of this ill-conceived article that was dead on arrival as far as I'm concerned, shall we?.As alluded to in the margins of two of the comments above - unfunded pension liability is a huge problem with GE and for the author and SA to publish an article about GE without even addressing this issue (word search of the term ""pension"" in the article returned null) is at best malpractice and at worst an indication that they are publishing sponsored content under the guise of just plain ill-advised content.Bottom line, as of the end of Q3 GE had GAAP shareholder equity of around $30B and, coincidentally, its unfunded pension liability was estimated by some knowledgeable analysts at about that same level as of that same point in time.  Since that time, I'm guessing shareholder equity has probably declined somewhat - or at best remained flat - and I'm certain that the unfunded pension liability has effectively increased even if the actuarial analysis has not been updated.",
Why are you commenting on 2017 results? -  they are a very old.  You should be providing analysis on recent results for a company as troubled as GE.Merger to United Technologies?  ain't going to happen for anti-trust reasons.Buffet purchasing GE? a troubled company with troubled management at perhaps a fair value.  Ain't happening unless he gets a sweetheart deal,
"Not buying and didn’t sell  consuderable holdings. Your  idea to merge Aviation with United will never happen because the government will never permit it. Take the two jet engine makers and let them merge into a domestic monopoly is a stretch.Buffett shows no interest in GE. The deal he got in 2008 was a riskless one for him. He knew the government would not let GE fail and the  deal he got was almost usury. Buying now would involve considerably more risk. Besides his venture into the food supply business isn’t turning out too well. The idea that GE as it exists today is too complex to manage is rediculous. Any business is too complex to manage if unqualified people are managing it. It seems to me that Healthcare and Transportation are being managed well. Power and oil and gas are and have not been managed by people who have the right experience and training. So sell the components that are managed well and keep those that are not is your prescription for reducing complexity?  I know i am exaggerating. Just let me conclude by asking why did the new, Chinese owners of large appliances and Wabtec negotiate keeping the GE logo on the products for years after the acquisition of those businesses?",

Lighting is still part of GE, they have not found a buyer for that business.  The GE Transportation merger with Wabtec also is not finalized, they have targeted ""early 2019"", so it's also not a done deal.",
"Interesting article, opens a robust discussion. My question is this, the 2 most recent CEOs are out, but what about the rest of the BOD ? From what I understand they have sat by idly and rubberstamped decisions, that have run this company into the ground....   IMHO, the rot in GE is deep and I BELIEVE that more bad news will be forthcoming, before any good news. 20 years of mismanagement will not be cured, in a couple of quarters.And I would never make a personal investment decision based upon what WB might do, at some point in the future. When the turnaround appears to be gaining traction, I'll layer in, until then I am content to watch.",

A company like GE must turn things around before being profitable. Until it do so, i would remain on the sidelines.Plus, if you look at GE's dividend history, dividend per share where cut regularly during the last few years.",
"Article mentions several times that Buffet will buy GE but not one single time provides any corroborating evidence to support this claim. So it's just worthless and feels like a transparent attempt to just wrap the name ""Buffet"" into the article.",
Not a strong buy currently IMO.,

"Well, Uncle Warren sure knew when to sell this pig in 2017, only makes sense he'd know when to buy.",
Nice analysis.,
"The GE/Berkshire idea makes sense (and yes it is speculative).  Warren likes industrial businesses, and if anyone can not only figure out the embedded liabilities and insure against them it would be Berkshire.  That said, where has he been as GE has collapsed?  My guess is if he announced a decent equity investment the stock rockets to $10-12 in a heartbeat.  If they were also to underwrite against GE's embedded liabilities, add another $2-3 dollars.  Now that would be a wonderful day in the neighborhood!",
"Power is the largest division and it is doing the worst.  No indication of a turn around in power, so not buying.  Maybe buy one of the spinoffs after it is spunoff.",
"why not to buy so cheap,  so cheap to sell",
"While I applaud a positive article about GE as a stockholder, it contains old news and some misconceptions. For example, the monetizing of BHGE stock diesn’t Involve awarding stock to existing stockholders. The announced deal with Wabtec dies but the ratio of shares maybe in question. Supposedly if and when Healthcare is spun out, GE shareholders will get shares in the independent company, ratio unknown. Whether or not the resultant holdings will in the aggregate be higher in absolute value is not knowable at this time. I have read about all the possible benefits of a Healthcare spin out, decrease in GE debt, more valuable as a stand alone business, etc, but I am not in favor of this spin out. It is a very profitable business, has competitive products and combining it with additive manufacturing capability for device prototyping and organ models is a whole new opportunity. Further, the idea that renewables is a great new opportunity is highly debatable. Look at the net this year. In the face of significant revenue growth, net is approaching zero. The expected high profit from installation and maintenance of installed base has not materialized. GE bought their blade manufacturer to increase margin and yet net went down. Further they are not in the leadership position in windmills and investing in a the construction of an off shore windmill project with a new giant blade(twice the size of existing blades) seems like a very risky attempt to differentiate its offering. In short, getting rid of Healthcare and Transportation eliminates two very profitable businesses with large fielded bases, xcellent  name recognition and leaves the resulting GE with  the one excellent business ( Aero) , power which is broken and assumed to contribute little or no net in 2019, renewables whiose net is steadily decreasing and GE capital which currently is a cash flow blotter. The trade off of selling profitable businesses to reduce debt is an interesting one. I am skeptical that the debt reduction over the long term is more important than retaining the Healthcare business, but I have to defer to the new management’s insight, I also believe that power’s problems will be solved quicker than the consensus and the recently announced reorganization is a positive first step.",

"I tend to disagree with your contention that WB would be a buyer at this point. This is not a company underpriced due to temporary events and it is not a company which has displayed good management. This company has been mismanaged for a very long time by people only looking to fill their pockets at the expense of the company and the shareholders. While I agree there is lots of potential for growth and a comeback, these will only happen with the right management team. WB does not buy into a company to change out their management so unless he is really impressed with the current ones he won't be a buyer. He might offer to throw them a rope with interest and an option to convert at a later date if they can actually turn this floundering ship around. For now my money will wait for actual signs of progress vice talks of what can or might happen.",

There is no way that the SEC would ever let GE Aviation merge with Pratt & Whitney. Talk about a monopoly....

"Thanks Olukayode for a succinct and clearly presented no frills breakdown of GE.  Like your style.

I've been dollar cost averaging on this company and am looking with anticipation when (or if) Warren is going to buy in.  A great New Year to all!",
Ge in my opinion is a speculative stock at this point with the potential to double by 2020,
"At least wait for it break its downtrend... if I had a dollar for every under valued stock that had a turnaround just around the corner, that had great news coming, or greatest new development, yet stock sinks ever lower: just wait... it’s going to double or triple, yet the stock sinks lower on every great write up...",
...are too rosy. We don’t know what WB is going to do. Strong buy is way too optimistic in my opinion.,
"Though I agree there may be value here, the fundamental assumptions are",
Very long GE. Ignore the noises.,
"Agree with Billy... there are way better bargains out there after the selloff.  Stocks with less risk and more focus.  Stocks with much more clarity.  That said, I think GE will soon be an investable stock.  They are still in the middle of cleaning house.  Invest in a company who already has a clean house and is now selling at a bargain...(too many to name).  When GE gets all its ducks in a row, I might start dipping my toes in but right now I’m buying the good ones that are oversold",
"GE will turn around. Insider buying and short covering  will soon   confirm . Even  it’s most ardentt sell analyst has publicly reversed his position recently - after months of strong  sell recommendations. I believe the price has bottomed out. I predict a gradual improvement in price  and a rapid appreciation resulting  from its first divestiture.The dividend kil, I believe,  forced a lot of institutions and retirement funds to  exit.

with the recent market sell off there are so many more stocks that are a screaming buy. for example why is the world would you wan to own GE when BAC was trading under 23?  makes no sense.

"Robert thank you so much for writing the article and putting up interview. Still not saying anything on actual costs which are way over what their test levels said, Their ramp up has been much more bumpy than news has said precipitating the selling.I was extremely disappointed to hear Ken say drilling at their 2 epithermal targets will maybe be the next year or two. So no exploration to speak of meaning no truth machine for quite some time.With a lack of production numbers to create a AISC cost no one can see what is happening with numbers, no upcoming drilling, constant selling across the board for the 2nd half of the year and nothing done to stem the tide. NEE vs. it's peers is a HARD SELL! NEE failed on the ramp up to even come close to their constantly harped de-risked pump job, late equipment deliveries and failed equipment setup timelines,  they had leach pad problems and who knows what else as they failed to disclose properly to share holders. Counting all the warrants 2018 was the year of heavy dilution for NEE. And now many months until drilling if not well over a year. AISC through the roof. HARD SELL!I see zero catalysts for months to right this listing ship.  I am very willing to hear your reasons why you may think that this stock will go up with a steady state gold price. We had a hundred dollar run to the upside on gold since the middle of August and NEE responded by going down at least another 20%.Hindsight is 20-20 but this stock is a strong sell. Of course I own so much of it that selling will be a problem into the USA side which hits a person for another .005 on every share sold at minimum.I advise you to not buy any NEE as I can see from your article you own none so therefore see NEE as not worthy of your own investment dollars.",

"Good Work here Rob and thanks.  I recently bought shares in Northern Vertex as part of my all in gold and silver companies strategy both in micro cap and levered large caps over the next 4-6 wks.  Right now it's the large caps which are showing me decent gains already but the smaller caps or micros appear delayed with sparse share movement.  This makes sense because right now the recent rise in gold and silver prices has attracted investor interest and their jumping in on the bigger visible ships like KL Gold.  The micros will catch up with a sustained rally as investors look for value and right now there are several  high quality smaller projects which are trading at ridiculously low prices like Telson (TSN).  It's trading at 40 cents.  It has great catalysts heading into the new year.  I think at some time next year it doubles in price quickly and, with a bit of help from a higher gold and silver price and improved sentiment in this space, it hits $1 easy.  Take a close look at the company and you will see.  Thanks for sharing man.",

The Ipace is not comparable to the model X because it’s only seats 5 while the model X seats 7 adults and has twice the storage space. The Ipace is more closer to the model 3 and model 3 is not available yet in Europe. Model 3 European sales next year will be ludicrous and will start in Q1. Tesla took 15years to make 300k cars but the next 300k will only take 12 months thanks to the model 3 ramp up and will continue ramping up as Shanghai Gigafactory timeline gets accelerated. 2018 is already Tesla’s most productive year ever but 2019 will be even more insane.,

"To find out if Tesla is losing model s/x sales you need to compare total year over year model s/x sales. Production has hit its desired capacity and if they sell 100k then they have lost no sales.

"Anton, you conveniently gloss over the fact that during the time in question, Tesla was not selling ANY Model 3 cars in Norway.

">Wait until model 3 arrives in EuropeHow long are we going to be waiting for that? The CEO said at the last earnings call that TSLA would be building cars for EU export in Jan (""early Jan"", IIRC), with the first actual sales happening in Feb or early March.   Meanwhile Jan is under a week away and the Model still hasn't been approved for EU sale yet.  Without going tin foil hat here, Tesla is pretty clearly behind schedule getting homologation, and appears to be cutting this pretty closely. Maybe homologation is imminent, but being Devil's advocate, what happens if homologation takes an extra quarter or worse. . .two quarters?  Per TSLA, SR car sales are still ""4-6 months off"", which means that if these get sold at all, it probably won't happen until Q3 of next year, after the full FITC expires.

Thanks for acknowledging that the numbers are missing Model 3 but the problem is that Model 3 itself is going to be the core of the Tesla story for the  foreseeable future so any conclusions on Tesla w/o accounting for Model 3 hold little value.,
"LOLWrong. 100% explained by the fact that they are still production limited and prioritized every sale possible to locations where tax credits are being reduced during the last six months. Anything less would not have been properly balancing the needs of the customers.There is zero need to place any of it the reasoning for the reduction on competitors that surprisingly were ready to take up a little slack while it is given. It won't be given next quarter. The sales of the more premium models may even hit new highs for the region despite Model 3 sales due to a backup of demand.The only way this analysis can be meaningful is if it turns out they have a few thousand unsold vehicles at the end of this quarter that weren't unsold simply due to inability to ship in time and could have made it to Norway before the end of the year. Otherwise, poppycock. Model S and X production is capped and will have sold its cap.",

Someone caught the fact that they went bankrupt when they expanded right before the last recession. They just doubled down with buying a Brazilian petro company right before the recession that will hit in the next few years maybe sooner. I bought very large when LYB was in the high 70's and sold in the 110's. These companies get crushed in a recession.

"I rarely add ""new"" stocks to my existing portfolio. However, I started researching LYB  when they emerged from bankruptcy.

( I did trim some this past year in Feb 2018 time-frame) But other than that, LYB is intended to be a very long term set it and forget it hold for me with dividends reinvested. As the current economic business cycle continues its transition from a late mid to a solid late phase historically the materials, healthcare and Energy sectors tends to outperform other sectors. With LYB approx -31% of it's high and year over year revenues up roughly 19.2%, and with holdings of cash and liquid investments of approx $2 billion. This certainly could be an opportunity for those value investors looking to initiate a new long term (or add to their existing) position.

Planning to add to the LYB position next month.,
"I really like this company. Made my first buy in November at $91.72 and have been adding, down to $80.26. It's a candidate to add more after the first of the year.

Brexit fears have also probably had some impact on share price as well.",

"Nice article as always.  I am wondering if you think BAC is cheaper than it looks in your model?  It appears to be about the cheapest large American bank, based on quality (but this is perhaps projecting my view).  I get your point - every bank is basically priced roughly in line for its RoTCE, so macro factors are likely to move the group in tandem.  XLF trading, which drives most of the direction of these stocks is also a very significant factor.Still, the question remains - what are the idiosyncratic factors that might move a bank to the right on the RoTCE scale?  To me, cost cuts are the obvious one, because of the ability to have a similarly sized balance sheet.  Avoiding poor credit quality is another.",

"So in view of this development and the combination of additive manufacturing to do device prototyping typing and produce replicas of organs for testing and education , do you believe Healthcare should be spun out.",
"The prudent man would be wise to consider that the man who drove this division from the preeminent market leadership position in diagnostic radiology down to third place is the was one Jeffrey Immelt. The quality of the current products is nothing like it was before Jeff was given the business. It is left to the reader to decide if this means the products are better or worse than they once were. Since I do not want to be sued, you'll have to research that question yourself. One would also be prudent to consider that the revenue recognition practices that are now the subject of scrutiny in other divisions were not perhaps also present in the Healthcare business. Service was once (and perhaps still?) the most profitable component of GE Healthcare and was considered its 'golden child' (I was at the recognition dinner). Finally, one would want to wonder if GE wasn't selling an outhouse that they'd wallpapered and marketed as a 'tiny house'. How do I know this? I've seen it happen to parts of the business. The author of the article is indeed incorrect when they lump GE Healthcare in with the likes of Cardinal Health. Their revenue models are nothing alike.Good luck.

Does the 18% include annual pension expense as well as headquarters services all of which would pass to Newco?In addition while Flannery proposed selling 20% of Medical and distributing 80% to suffering shareholders, Culp is aiming to sell 40% but has not, to my knowledge, committed to distributing the remaining 60%.As SA analysts have also reported in Capital's balance sheet there is some $30 billion of assets for which there is no associated income. Why the silence on what that is about?",
"I agree with toh192 in that GE Healthcare does not compare well with the likes of United Healthcare.   I work at GE Healthcare and we develop, manufacture and service medical devices .  We have been a part of GE for many MANY years .  The life sciences business is relatively recent with the addition of Amersham.  You are correct in that we are profitable, which makes it a great place to be, whatever the future ownership structure may end up looking like.  My own personal view is that this about generating  much needed cash now for GE and not about anything negative about the future of the Healthcare business.",
"Agree with many of the comments again. Comparing GE Healthcare to Cardinal Health is completely missing the mark.  Cardinal specializes in distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical products - but GE Healthcare specializes in medical imaging equipment (CT, MRI), some of the software that run radiology solutions (GE PACS) and radio-pharmaceuticals among others. Seimans is a better comparison. Medical imaging volumes continue to grow world wide much faster then medical services in general.",

"@TradeCircle--I would respectively submit that before writing an article which is primarily based on legal proceedings you have a thorough discussion with a Plaintiff's class action attorney and an insurance defense attorney.  You said, ""a Missouri judge ordering a payout of $4.69 billion to 22 women this past summer"" without explaining the make-up of the verdict and without referencing the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court.  You also said, ""Johnson & Johnson has been battling claims against its talc powder causing cancer in courts for years, with some success, as two months ago a jury overturned a verdict against J&J in New Jersey.""  Your reference is to a trial in New Jersey, in which the jury took only a half hour to come back with in favor of Johnson and Johnson.  There was  a reference to 2 California juries taking days on their cases without disclosing the outcome of the cases; those cases had nothing to do with the New Jersey case.The Missouri case has only gotten as far as the Judge turning down a Motion for a New Trial.  It is just now starting in the appellate courts.  The $4.69 billion is made up of two parts:  The first part is the actual pecuniary losses suffered by the Plaintiffs, sometimes called compensatory damages, such as pain and suffering, loss of income, medical expenses and other items which are directly related to a particular individual.  These must be proven with specific evidence.  It is very difficult to get more than $5,000,000 for an individual.  The second type of damages are punitive damages; these are meant to punish the Defendant for bad conduct.  Punitive damages are not necessarily related to the amount of compensatory damages.  Large punitive damages are usually drastically reduced.  The $4.69 billion award is not even remotely close to what the ultimate payout will be, if they succeed on appeal.Of the 22 Plaintiffs in the Missouri case, it is believed that almost all were residents of states other than Missouri.  Historically it has been common for Plaintiffs to bring personal injury actions against large corporations in states which are likely to give them high awards for their injuries.  The ability to do this was sharply curtailed in the Bristol-Meyers case.  It is expected that the verdicts in favor of most of the Plaintiffs will be dismissed on this basis. Between the reduction of the punitive damage award and the dismissal of most of the Plaintiffs in the Missouri case brings the judgment, if it can sustained on appeal, to a very low amount.  The latest figure I have seen on the cases which have been completed through the appeal process has Johnson and Johnson winning 35 - to - 0, with 5 more which have not been resolved.You make the statement, ""It won’t be taken to the mathematical extreme, but just for the sake of putting this into perspective and taking recent verdicts into account, it would be $213M per litigant, multiplied by 11,700, which totals $2.5 trillion in liabilities.""  I did not see any foundation for ""213M per litigant, multiplied by 11,700, which totals $2.5 trillion in liabilities.  It appears that you have completely disregarded all of the cases which Johnson and Johnson have won, because of the assumption that each of the 11,700 Plaintiffs will average receiving $213M.Jus a thought or two.",

This Asbestos accusation puts the PhD.Chemists who run the Factory for JNJ against the Lawyers who are picking and choosing words . The NJ overturn in JNJs favor was accomplished by putting forth the Records of the PhD Chemists  who in their test results swore their labs never made any products with Asbestos in them.   The Jury believed the  jnj PhD  Chemist over the lawyers of the Plaintiffs who claimed an outside source tested and found Asbestos in the Feedstock but not in a single study was this done on the Actual products that were sold to the public.  What has happened is that JNJ has honed and polished their defense .  Expect this tactic to be used in the future cases.,
@TradeCircle Shares can be in trouble as long as the divvy isn't in trouble!  :-),

They did know about the ""possibility"" of asbestos in talcum powder way back.  They have test results for decades showing little to no such contamination.  The US limit for asbestos in a lot of products is one per cent.  Can you really prove anyone's cancer was caused by inhaling talcum powder distributed by JNJ?  I doubt it but never underestimate a judge and jury having pity on the individual against a big deep pocketed corporation.  I believe in the end they will reach a settlement, set up a fund to help possible ""victims"", and they will be out a few billion dollars over it.  Just my opinion.",
"I read somewhere the other day that the science on the subject doesn't support the lawsuits, but then courts, which can be unequally sympathetic to plaintiffs and possibly anti-business to begin with, don't always follow the science, however disinterested (objective) and credible.
