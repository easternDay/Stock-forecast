"Confounded Interest. Very appropriate title. Bought this company years ago thinking much like the majority of you as an early stage and growing future. Sadly they could not make a profit, stock nose divided and a litigation suit pursued against the firm.

"""However producing, installing and servicing massive and complex wind energy installations requires extreme technical precision, strong intellectual property protection and the financial scale to deliver a product that can be relied upon for perhaps decades of faithful service.""Not true. Strong intellectual property protection is utterly irrelevant to producing installing and servicing *anything*. What it does is stop copycats imitating you (except in China and other countries that care zilch for foreigners' copyright rights) and enables you to overcharge your customers (""extract and economic rent from your IP"") to increase profits.",
Thanks for the article. I’m surprised that you didn’t mention Ørsted (formerly DONG) as one of the big players. They appear strongly committed to renewables (principally wind) after selling off their fossil fuel and other assets over the past few years. Their focus is mostly offshore so they probably wouldn’t show up in the “Top 10 Onshore Wind Turbine Manufacturers” list from Bloomberg.I feel like wind energy has a huge future and there can be multiple winners in the field. I’m looking to Vestas to be one of them. Long VWDRY.,

"Large-format dining and entertainment space is littered with high-profile failures (remember EPSPN Zone?). Inevitably these concepts suffer from consumer fatigue exacerbated by execution issues. PLAY is no different esp since due diligence suggests mgmt has little-to-no passion for brand and unit-level employees have no decision-making authority given rigid corporate structure. Feedback also suggests corporate has been under-investing to sustain margins b/c they know once they lose margins the story is over given hefty op leverage in the model. Benefits of $100M refurb cycle are rolling off and given no barriers amusements success has already attracted a flood of new capital beyond just MainEvent, TopGolf, etc.PLAY was hated at IPO (I played it), sentiment improved on impressive beat/raise cycle (that mgmt sold aggressively into). Now the beat/raise cycle is over and fund'ls are deteriorating yet most remain in denial (in part b/c of overwhelmingly bullish market sentiment). IMHO next phase concludes with return to bearish narrative in place at IPO (""mediocre cyclical in a challenging category w no barriers"") that will be accompanied by sell-side d/g cycle (currently 100% buy ratings). Just my 2 cents. GLTA.",
"PLAY is actually one of the better run restaurant companies but it still falls prey to the same issues as other operators.  The big one is same store sales (SSS).  Even if the valuation looks good for PLAY right now as long as SSS is negative the stock will underperform.  I owned PLAY for about a year and a half, buying in the low 40s, riding it above 70 and selling in the high 40s.  I bought in just before the restaurant industry rolled over as a whole and didn't see it getting so bad in an otherwise good economy.  I'm not a trader.  I owned BWLD from 2006 until this month.  The big problem for PLAY (and others) is that there are far too many restaurants.  Chains are still expanding when they should be contracting.  PLAY mentioned Top Golf and another competitor in their conference call and these companies are expanding far too quickly for any company to demonstrate improving metrics.  PLAY also mentioned in the same call how 1/3 of their stores are mall based and after having outperformed for years they were starting to underperform the rest of the store base.  On-line shopping is here to stay and it will only get worse for these poorly positioned stores.  The only way to improve SSS is to cut prices and this never works out well for low margin businesses. In short this industry has problems of borderline extreme overcapacity.  Even the best operators are going to have problems.  I'll wait until I see some industry rationalization.",
The 22% drop on the 7th was excessive. That was a great chance for a new position ($44.80 on mine). I feel $50 is very reasonable short term & on next results if decent - this will be back to $55,

Something’s wrong here Robert. NYNY closed at $26.85 the day you published the article (Jan. 16). At that time you said the stock was worth $9 at best. Today it closed at $28.70 and you still haven’t shorted it? Why would you tell your readers to short it at $26.85 and not short it yourself when it’s at $28.70? Surely you’re not trying to squeeze the last dollar out of it if it’s only worth $9.,

"What a load of nonsense. If you want to be intellectually honest, the overall institutional holdings of TSLA increased in the third quarter.

"DonnThanks for another nice article.  I do have a question about the institutional ownership - there are different types, which are sometimes difficult to differentiate.  Some invest for their own account, some run mutual funds, others are primarily index funds.  As I look at the insty ownership as listed on Nasdaq, of the top 11 owners of Tesla, Six show increased ownership on their most recent 13F.  These include Vanguard, Blackrock, Bank of Montreal, State Street, and Invesco.  Without a deeper dive than I am willing to undergo, it looks to me as if increasing institutional ownership of Tesla is largely limited to those running ETF’s and index funds.  Could this be a new class of deep-pocketed bag holders considering the proliferation of these over the past ten or so years?Any feedback would be appreciated.",
"Donn,This may have been mentioned in the Comments, but in case not, here is a more cynical reason for Fidelity share sell off. I would not be surprised if Fidelity was given a quiet ""whisper"" about an upcoming capital raise involving the sale of stock by Tesla. Fidelity could then sell a good size chink of its shares above $300, which would give the funds the ability to buy $1billion or more of the shares offered in the capital raise. I would not be surprised if the stock sold in the capital raise comes out around $300.This would give Fidelity funds a profit on the shares they sell, and it would give Fidelity a way to help Tesla stay solvent and would protect the value of the huge block of shares still owned by Fidelity funds.",

To people who weren't as positive about Tesla before, perhaps.Apparently Will Danoff did decide to take profits at Contrafund, but boy were they overweight on TSLA before.

They got in early with cheap shares bought up big back in what, early 2013 after 13Q1 ""profits"" occurred?  I think they bought like 2 million shares in the $30-35 range.

The markets TSLA are in: EV, car sharing, energy, will certainly support that kind of market value.One thing that will get TSLA there fast is to sell ~15-20% of shares to Apple in exchange for $10B and some help with manufacturing. I am sure Apple are very interested in that with the promise that in 5-10 years Elon will sell the whole company to Apple to focus on Mars full time.",

"Donn nice article.  I went and checked some of the reduction number  and agree that the portfolio changes are correct - so thanks for presenting an accurate picture.  In my view although I am a Tesla fan, the investor brain over rules my wanna-believe heart.  Tesla poses several issues as well pointed out here and in other articles1. Competition has rapidly caught up.  GM notably has been doing very well on its Bolt, and has a solid strategy around a true Self Driving Taxi as unveiled.  Not to mention, all the other competitors from Porsche, Ferrari, etc.  Tesla has really missed its opportunity here to cement market share.2. Cash Flow.  With production delays and further cash needed to fund costs, this is a real concern that Tesla will need to address.3. Liquidity Raising.  So how will Tesla fund the above. I have no doubt that they can but they are presented with a number of ugly options considering the risk in the marketplace by lenders.  Options include exorbitant interest rate on top of current debt via bonds etc, or increasing equity stock.  The latter will have impact on market and I think will send the market running for cover as bears make Case.Mid Feb will be an interesting earnings report.  I don’t think market will shrug off another bad news story.   Of course, Musk may pull out the electric helicopter but I doubt more hyperbole will content investors this time around.  We will see",

"Baillie Gifford is the second largest institutional holder of TSLA, all on a discretionary basis. They have been long for several years and have clearly made plenty for their investors. Their philosophy is to buy and hold long term a small number of holdings in companies that they believe will be the dominant players in economic themes that they think will govern the global economy over the next several years.  They are extremely patient and it will interesting to see how their holdings have changed in recent months.    I suggest longs (and shorts) keep an eye on this very successful long term holder as any indication that they are starting to cut their position aggressively could be a sign that either  their belief in TSLA eventually becoming one of these dominant players of the next 10 years is wavering or that they have finally seen the prospect of any hope of profitability vanishing further into the future and have decided to take profits and reinvest in a different theme.  In either scenario, it could get ugly below.",

What will the Model Y and pickup be? Prepay the entire price like the Founder's Series Roadster?

Thank you for the great information on these small community banks.  I worry how they will hold up on a market dip.  Thanks again.,
"Phil, Your original article--and the subsequent performance of these stocks--made quite an impression on me.  I have definitely been on the lookout for some additional one-branch wonders.  Kudos to you for discovering all these additional names.  Despite searching high and low, I could find only two: AMBK (Allentown, PA) and UNIB (Ann Arbor, MI).  After I discovered American Bank in mid-2017, I became a big fan of the Jaindls and have steadily accumulated shares since then. It's a bank with ROA > 1% and ROE > 10%, and a whistle-clean loan book. While the rest of the market has appreciated, AMBK has been flat to slightly down.  I can only think of two reasons why.  First, when American Bank went private in 2007, Mark W. Jaindl owned 3,366,955 shares, or 57.9% following the transaction. The next highest ownership was Martin F. Spiro and Phillip S. Schwartz, with 431,404 and 269,326 shares, or 7.4% and 4.6%, respectively. No other insider owned more than 1% of the shares.  Since Mr. Spiro passed away in March 2017, is it  possible that his estate has been liquidating shares into a thin market?  Secondly, American was one of the original internet banks, and they have been traditionally exposed to higher deposit costs in a rising rate environment (they have a decent slug of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings too).  I find it interesting that another large community bank in the Lehigh Valley, Bethlehem-based Embassy Bancorp (EMYB) has cited significant growth in deposits due to merger-related disruption. I think that American would benefit from opening a branch, because the local banking market has been turned upside down: BB&T acquired both Susquehanna (August 2015) and Allentown's National Penn Bank (April 2016). Key Corp purchased First Niagara (July 2016). And, the largest bank in the area, Wells Fargo, has experienced its share of troubles over the last couple of years.Thanks for all of your contributions and additional names to research.

"""you would have been WAY up""  not unless I sold them though, they are pretty to look at but, but  don't bring any money unless they get sold, with T you can buy lots of shares, and get money for more dividends.  Apple gives zero dividends per share, so if i can only afford to buy one share, what it that?   With BA at least  1.71 but it costs over 350, for one share, so that's 1.71 every 4 months to 1000.00  plus for T every 4 months.  Whereas, 10 shares of T equal to one share of BA gives you 5.00 every 4 months.   BA = 1.74 or T = 5.00 which one do you take?",
"Snowfire you seem to be missing something. Amazon went  from $6 to $1425 while T went nowhere. ........MSFT a good dividend.

"I had BA, and ABBV when they were way down there, can't make much money having only a few shares, i sold them to get T, i made over 1000. from T's dividend, this last time, and now i've got lots of different stocks, and they all pay divis, i am hoping T goes back down again so i can afford to buy her back again, i have been buying back one share every time she looks like she goes back down, but,  people don't usually buy it until she goes around the 35.'s i think there are people out there playing with her right now, it's keeping T in the same area, they buy, then sell, then buy again, trading back and forth, makes me dizzy, besides i'm not great with math, took me forever to figure out algebra, once i did, i got nothing but A's and got up to doing Trig, getting A's in that too, but it never was my great love.  I liked history and the sciences much more.  I must be weird, but i never cared for Amazon, Apple, much don't forget, what goes up comes down eventually too.",
"Snowfire: Apple pays a dividend as does BA and GS and MSFT.  You made money just holding it. Actually, you would have made almost two years of dividend payments in a week. Plus--Apple sells at a lower PE multiple than T, has a much higher growth rate, and is growing their dividend at a much faster rate than T.  Check out ABBV as well.",
"James, if I had bought Apple, i would also need to sell it again in order to make any money from it, those stocks that go up, and up need to be sold in order to make money, then what, no money, or got to buy it back at higher price.  It's kind of a repeat process I guess, it's easier to just hold on and wait for dividends to come in I think.",
"It is truly incredible that even in a market that has moved up 5% in  a week T  can't grab a bid. Between yesterday and today----with the Dow up 2%, SPY up 2%, NASDAQ up 3% T is down again.

As tempting as it might be to buy during dips at this point, there aren't too many stocks I would buy if the market sells off again Monday. T and XOM are two that I will buy because of the dividend. I will also buy GOOG and BRKB. I like to buy stocks when they are on sale and sell them when they bounce back. If I were looking to buy and hold for dividends, I would go with T, SO, XOM, and FNCL for an IRA. The worrying issue on the horizon for T is how much it sells off when the deal to buy TWX goes through and they incur all that debt. The drop could be significant. XOM on weakness due to missing earnings looks like the better buy and hold to me provided it drops back Monday because the earnings miss will be baked into PPS and they will not miss earnings next quarter.",
"Who was it that bought T so much today that the stock price went up so high?  I want to thank that person, because it enabled me to sell my high priced shares, so now when I go to buy T back, i can get T at a lower price, i still have 200 shares of T, but I want to buy it back again, and maybe put some extra money into another stock with a great dividend, and around same price as T if I can find one.",

Across the years I have re-accumulated to almost my initial (oversized) position.T is not my only DGI (or growth stalwart) in my portfolio as I am sure it is not of most experienced and sentient investors.T offers as close to the S.W.A.N. stock that most investors can own.

"If Tesla tries to sharply reduce inventory in Q4 to generate cash, it will also worsen the P/L performance as putting a car to inventory capitalizes overhead. When you shut the line down, that overhead drops straight to the bottom line. Q4 could be a real disaster!

Tesla profitability is determined by how fast it expands its production lines, facilities, and services for its fleet of car and its other businesses. By the way, I note that Chevrolet is not making any money on the Bolt. To be fair, shouldn't you also be attacking Chevrolet and shorting GM?It is clear that there is desperation in Detroit and Europe about Tesla's disruptive business model and products. The frustration is shown in the fact that the entire industry is following Tesla's lead and then trying to kill the king.

"Wish I could be a fly on the wall for some of the emails & conversations among managers and directors at Tesla. These people aren't stupid, and they're not niaive.

Most of them probably have an exit plan from Tesla, timed to sync up with when the bulk of their options vest.  After all when you get a new boss every 8 months, you gotta know that the co is pretty shaky.(VP's & directors come & go from Tesla constantly.)Seen it all before in the valley.

I knew a guy like that who worked for Sears, yes Sears. He worked there for 45 years and just kept saving money and taking advantage of any co savings plans they made available. He retired over 20 years ago and died about 12 years ago, so yes his timing was good. But it happens.  His wife worked for many years at Ames and then at Kmart. Neither of them ever had any college.

During this period, they issued a net $3.9B in debt, and sold $1.5B of PSXP shares to the public (the latter is, effectively, sale of assets by dropping them down into PSXP).  Clearly, this is not sustainable.  Hopefully, the start-up of the new facilities and improved margins will be enough to reverse this trend.

If AMD guidance on 1/30 is negative on the crypto demand then watch NVDA retreat 10% before they declare on 2/7.

"The spike in cryptocurrency prices over the last 3 months of 2017 changed the ROI for GPU mining of coins that use GPUs (Ether & Zcash for example - not Bitcoin or Litecoin which are mainly mined via ASICs).  So we really must pull Bitcoin out when we talk about crypto's potential impact for AMD and NVIDIA.  GPU mining demand should remain robust in 2018, but remember ROI is always at risk if the crypto price drops (or mining difficulty increases).  All that said, we've seen exactly what you've seen, prices rising and inventories shrinking for GPUs.  FYI - We prefer AMD mainly due to price/performance, and they just implemented a new ""compute mode"" in their driver set that has given us big increases in hash rate with no additional hardware and no additional electricity usage. The ""compute"" driver capability demonstrates that AMD is more miner-friendly than Nvidia.  We love Nvidia devices and the efficiency of Pascal, but in general the cost premium for Nvidia is not warranted by their increased performance over AMD. ~ Dev Horn, CEO - ETHERMining.co",

While AAOI is become more a secondary and tertiary supplier to many hyper scale that are seeking redundancy in supply and diversification, many of aaoi’s mid tier prospects are ramping up quickly and should contribute to revenue in the coming few quarters.   Margin pressure is very intense (approx 18-26% reductions ) based on yoy concessions / price negotiations which is very high compared to 15% typical.   Given AAOI leadership in supply chain this should amount to a net 5% Gm hit normalized for a full year.   Based on all the puts and takes the analysis generates a target bottom of $18-$26 over the next quarter with a v shaped curve poised to double by year end, implying a $36 - $52 share price give or take which provides a nice return from current levels.   Strategy if you are long: generate cash and dollar cost average in 25% thresholds to reduce PPS based on above targets.

It’s also my understanding, again, not a scientist, that Eptimenuzab prevents the CGRP from forming in the first place, whereas the others do not prevent, they just treat the symptoms like the existing drugs, albeit with fewer side effects than the current options. To me, going to get prevention 4 times per year and getting almost totally free of headaches is better than having to give myself a shot 12x per year. But that’s just me.

"As a physician and multiple myeloma patient, I want to comment on the vast benefit of a subcutaneous medication to an intravenous one.

Also, since its competitors will come to market first, why would a physician switch backwards to an IV preparation unless the efficacy was considerably better.",

"Given all the other contenders in the race, with products in the pipeline from Teva, Amgen and Novartis, Eli Lilly and Amgen, can you really have any real confidence that Alder's product will have more than a sliver of the market, assuming it gets approved?",
"Michael, nice article but I wanted to give you some numbers from the trenches.   Bottom line, I think revenues will be 600M-800M by 2021.I estimate the wholesale price will be $5500-$6000, +/- the same wholesale price as Botox (200 units) every 3 months.   The retail price will vary depending on the payer (insurers negotiate with healthcare groups and Medicare pays about 4.5% above wholesale).  Additionally, there will be an infusion fee (every 3 months) of about $150 for Medicare and $200-300 for private insurers.   Infusion fees will be much higher if done at a facility (i.e. outpatient infusion center) instead of Doctor's office but Alder will not have access to these fees.   I expect 2B revenues for the anti-CGRP class but this will be split between Alder's IV formulation (Eptinezumab) and 3 similar subcutaneous formulations (Amgen, Lilly and Teva).   The IV formulation has some advantages (quarterly infusion, nurse will give the dose, quicker onset) but Alder's drug will be #3 or #4 to market with Amgen's drug having a mid May 2018 PDUFA date.  Amgen will be partnering with Novartis and they already have a Neuro sales force that can help identify practices.  All drugs will likely have similar pricing.   I think Alder gets 30-40% market share once all have ramped up.  Chronic migraine is treated mostly by Neurology and many mid to large sized groups already do infusions in the office (we do > 100 infusions/month of various drugs, mostly for MS).  As a good rule of thumb, any practice doing Botox for migraine with an infusion center will very quickly start using this drug on some patients.   Academic and employed groups will be sending to their system's outpatient infusion centers.  My guess is 50-65% of the Botox chronic migraine patients will switch to one of these drugs and a mildly larger number of patients not on Botox will also be on one of these 4 drugs after a few years.   I think the chance for approval is 80-85% by mid 2019 and ultimately 95% as drug very safe in trials and endpoints were met with very good significance.  Always a little chance of failure when numbers looked at by statisticians at FDA and always chance of delay due to poorly prepared application or manufacturing issue that eventually gets fixed.   Market risk is a bigger unknown as all 4 drugs enter the ring and compete.Disclosure:  Long ALDR.   No current financial stake in any of the companies mentioned above.",
"I think your numbers are way off and you’re overthinking this too much. How do you get only $375 million yearly revenue, $337 gross profit, and then spending $200 million annually on SG &A expenses?  Does that make sense (especially considering the current market cap).  I believe the $1.5 to $2 billion market opportunity means that’s what Alder expect to make in revenue each year (and that’d certainly support the current share price with a healthy amount of risk apparently still being reflected). Here’s a few problems as I see it with your numbers...First, your arrival at $1,111 for annual treatment cost seems way too low. I haven’t seen anything predicting such a low annual treatment cost. The low end I’ve seen is $8,000 per year. Here are some links:http://on.mktw.net/2FR...http://bit.ly/2tJsyo2Second, the number of patients (1.35 million) you predict treated seems way too high. Note, of the 5 million severely impacted migraine patients, 3 million are chronic. The drug is only I’d say beneficially effective for 1/3 of patients. It effectively cures 15% of patients. Thus, it seems like a better estimate of customers is to use these numbers. Let’s just assume Alder only captures 15% of chronic migraine sufferers (and no other customer), and of those for one reason or another only 50% of those actually become regular users of Alder’s drug. That would mean 225,000 customers, paying the low end of $8,000 per year, equals $1.8 billion in annual revenue, which is at upper-middle end of Alder’s estimated market of $1.5 to $2 billion. That means a big upside from the current share price.  Last, and I know this hasn’t even really been addressed by anyone as far as I can tell, but aren’t the 5 million severe migraine (and 3 million chronic) patient numbers only based on the US market? What then is the impact of the recent settlement with Teva and the resulting opportunity for Alder to sell its drug globally? Is that just “gravy” on top of your calculations?  It seems to me that no pricing model has factored in any revenue/profits from the global opportunity of Epti. Perhaps that is due to the EU dispute with Teva, which up to last week was a big hangover. I suppose we’ll need to get details about a partnership before those numbers can be factored in. Anyway, I guess my biggest question with your article is the annual cost you use for Epti. At $1,111 per year, that puts each infusion at $277.75. Doesn’t that seem way too low?  (I suppose the plus side to that cost would be that I guess you could have close to 1.5 million customers or more for that cheap).",

I would not be surprised in the Post Office picks up the packages also.One govt. agency that could operate at a profit and payback the taxpayers for their investments over 200 years choose to give their profits to a company that keeps its profits offshore.",
Sam Zell noted on CNBC that AMZN is priced as if it were 25% of US GDP.  Does that make sense ?  No.,
"""So, the standard approach to evaluating a company through its multiples is clearly not suited to Amazon.""But yet you use PEG.That's a multiple...and a pretty common one to use. Seems like the article is just basically, ""don't use PE, use PEG"" which could be said for most companies, regardless of industry...use both to get a picture of the past (PE) and future (PEG).That said, if the median PEG in your universe is 1.92 and AMZN is 1.91...that would indicate it's where its most likely to be...pretty much the concensus ""fair value"" of the stock. it's V, PYPL, MA, YNDX, and GOOGL...that's underestimated...i.e. those with a lower PEG.",
"The bottom line with AMZN is that everyone talks about all of the company's untapped growth potential, but for an investor, we must not assume the other team is just going to walk off the field when AMZN enters into the game.  So if we evaluate the current business model, the only business generating materiial profit for AMZN is AWS.  In cloud services, although initially AMZN had an early mover advantage in the cloud, that advantage is disappearing at a very rapid pace.  MSFT and GOOGL are taking market share, as well as IBM.  All three are significant players with deep pockets and high quality offerings.  AWS (the cloud service) is AMZN's golden goose (not retail/ecommerce or any other fantasy future business all of the bulls want to dream about--advertising is dominated by FB and GOOGL, extremely tough competition).  With the accelerating cloud service competition from MSFT, GOOGL and IBM, plus competition from ORCL, SAP and others, pricing and AMZN's overall revenue growth rate from AWS will come down rapidly, squeezing profit growth in that area as well.  Logically, it makes sense that AMZN may have a few quarters left growing at the current pace before that growth rate slows down dramatically.Remember when CSCO lowered its growth rate in 2000 due to loss of pricing power in routers/switches, etc?  That day may be coming soon for AWS and AMZN.  The $22/share+ in EPS that analysts are forecasting in 2020 will be tough to achieve, aside from the fact that the stock is very pricey already, trading at 58x that aggressive 2020 EPS forecast.  This EPS forecast will be especially tough to reach now that the company has more than 540,000 employees, accompanying a massive fixed cost structure that they did not have in the early days when analysts were recommending the stock as a bricks and mortar business killer.  Not the case anymore as the company tries to look more and more like WMT every day.  Good luck using price/sales as your decision metric, but I do not see that as relevant going forward--the time has come for AMZN to produce actual earnings growth.",

Its  so undervalued  that the  author has no  position  in  the  company ??   Lol,
About 1/2 of Amazon's sales are from affiliates most of whom do not currently collect sales taxes.  That is likely to change when the Supreme Court addresses online sales tax rules in June. I suspect the impact on the affiliates will be a negative for Amazon's growth.,

Fake news...fake amazon...love the company not so much the stock I think it's way overvalued but I don't own any. They simply will not take over the world. Like the evil China Baba business model better.,
"""So, the standard approach to evaluating a company through its multiples is clearly not suited to Amazon. We need another technique.""It's also at least worth considering the potential that Amazon could just be a bubble... I don't pretend to know the answer to this but it's just as reasonable a statement as the author is making.My opinion is that this entire article is an exercise in futility. That any attempt to value Amazon is far more guesswork than it is logical analysis. I mean just look at this crud... the author is using estimates of massive earnings growth from a company who has basically never had any earnings over 20 years.To me Amazon is simple. They reinvest all their earnings. This has kept, and continues to keep, revenue growing at an extremely fast clip. But, there will be a point in time fairly soon when Amazon will be more mature and will struggle to keep revenue growing at the current rates. This is a mathematical certainty. Amazon investors are okay with no earnings when revenue is growing at 40% YoY but I highly doubt that they will be okay with no earnings and 12% revenue growth. When this time comes Amazon will either have to show investors that they can produce earnings to justify their valuation or the stock will go into a free fall.I have no idea where all this shakes out. Maybe when this time comes Amazon shows that it can produce earnings far in excess of what the multiples imply. This of course would cause the stock to rocket up. Maybe the earnings come in far below. But like I said, that's really the problem with this article and valuing Amazon. It's pretty much impossible to know where this shakes out at this point.",
Great Article Oleh Kombaier ! Thank You So Much-JD,
">>Analyst Daniel Salmon writes that “the emergence of Amazon’s advertising business can support both margin and multiple expansion and could be a greater catalyst for the shares if management shares more data points like it did for Amazon Web Services.”I fail to see how Amazon is going to take share in advertising from Google and FB so this will be a complete fail. Google/FB have more cash, better engineers, and higher salaries. In the end better people will come up with better solutions. Google doesn't sell many products and FB doesn't sell any so there is no conflict of interest where you sell a product but run competitors ads on the same page. Finally, there is a monopoly issue when you both sell products and control their advertisement. Oh yeah..and you have a great admirer in WH who is itching to get DOJ involved. Sounds like a formula for another Amazon Phone.",
"You show expected earnings growth of 85% this year, but year after year analyst forward earnings estimates for Amazon have been way off.  In January 2017 analysts said Amazon would earn over $8 a share for all of 2017.  Then every quarter the estimates were brought down, turns out the company will make only about $4.33. That's a miss of almost 50%.  In 2014 analysts estimated Amazon would be making $20 a share for 2017, the $4.33 number means they were off by about 80%.  These misses are typical, Amazon's anemic margins do not permit it to make significant profits, i doubt they ever will.",

Judging price sales on a company willing to sell 3p items at a loss for market share is extremely foolish.  After 20 years of bashing brick and mortar they are entering physical retail!  Amazon isn't going bankrupt but no way I'm holding at these levels.,
"50% of all product searches start with Amazon and Marketers like this as the audience that searches products are buyers and more likely to buy - product oriented ads revenues will move to Amazon from Gooogle/FB.  As they enter new markets such as services they will also acquire the lion share of service revenues.  People go on Amazon not because it't the cheapest, they go there because they have selection and they are good at fulfillment.  Do you remember the old fedex commercial - “When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight”  Amazon is obsessed with the customer and will continue to sell for a loss to enter markets where they will make their real money.",
"Amazon dominates market share and still CAN’t turn a profit. Now Walmart and several others have joined ecommerce, essentially making it impossible for amazon to raise prices, charge for shipping etc. Amazon is great at growth, terrible at making $.",
"Stock valuation based upon past financial reports leads to investment failure!

Amazon shares are up 2.2%.       Previously: SunTrust raises Amazon price target to $1,400; shares +2% (Jan. 12)",
"I wouldn't say that AMZN is undervalued, great companies that are expanding are always overvalued as the valuation of the goodwill drives up the price.  You will always have to pay more to get into the game and you just have to hope that you got it right.  I missed out on a lot of opportunities but I did great with Amazon.  Amazon is changing the paradigm in anything they lay their hands on.  Let me ask Seeking Alpha readers this question.  How many companies can evolve from their original model into a new model successfully?  MSFT makes most of their money from Office, Google from digital ads.  There are very few companies that continue to innovate and enter new markets successfully. This is what makes AMZN a valuable holding.",

"the puts will move 1000% plus at some point, likely a while off yet...",
Lots of nonsense in this thread. For myself I just go to FASTGRAPHS and plot Operating Cash flow versus time on a semi-log plot. The resulting straight line for AMZN tells me everything I want to know.,
Ok I maybe the second biggest fan of amazon behind Gary J. And I even think this article is laughable!  Everybody knows news and growth potential drives stock price unusually fast whereas financials and metrics keep it there over the long haul.  Amazon is the epitome of untapped growth potential thus the super fast stock price growth.  It’s as simple as that...,
They have to double eps for a while or a huge fall,
Heard this before in 2001 with csco - where are they now?  AMZN bought their growth this year with Whole Foods purchase.  About $15B revenues cost them about $14B in cash/debt.  Let's see what happens in 2019.  Most of their revenue growth is in retail too -  not exactly high margin even for the best of retailers like Walmart.  In fact amazon likely will have negative margins when it comes to retail.,

"""Amazon can only be valued...through the prism of growth"".  That is simply not true.

Imagine if you make a product worth $10 based on COGS, Labor, Cost of Capital, etc. and Amazon has the arrogance to say they are going to sell it for $9.

Masa has engineered Sprint to become a holding company of units that can be owned by many interests out of sight of shareholders and Regulators. Call them bankers if you like.However....Masa has access to a  massive amount of new cash from sources that may not all be secure and  ahem 'blood-free'. There are times to give a patient whole blood infusions, and other times for purified, filtered plasma free of virus and other pathogens.YOU should notice that dotGOV is acting aggressively toward ATT's relationship with Huawei and FCCs review of CHL. There are reasons and reasoning here to understand.What shareholders with large holdings should applaud is the entrance of Mr. Combes who has led VOD, ALU, Altice and now brings those years of insight to Sprint.Combes has particular insight into Eastern sentiment and Politics and can guide Masa's Enterprise into Safe Harbor*  agreements with new Minority owners. That is what Masa so desperately wants and those Minority owners are desperately seeking a place to place those newly minted renminbi or dollars or rupees or shekels. They have obligations to stay ahead of - a roaring Asian Tiger called INFLATION.*Safe_harbor_(law) see Wiki http://bit.ly/2FIrCE0)BUT, we should be cautious about those new owners.A macroeconomic sea-change has occurred in China  and it isn't friendly to anyone - necessary, yes.China is demanding of companies operating in its territories that they GIVE UP OWNERSHIP SHARES in their companies in a so-called ""SALE"" to RE-Organize in a ""beneficial"" manner. In effect, China is taking shares from profit-making companies and diluting its own SOE debt with these fresh shares to support the balance sheets of thousands. China is taking shares as a new form of taxation.^THAT^ means these new Sprint bankers are at risk of a 'TAKING' they cannot control nor predict.So, while news reflects technology concerns, the over arching concern is financial security including banking security.. Did you see the new Ant Financial product announcement in Reuters today?  ""JANUARY 15, 2018 Ant Financial says has received approval for new consumer-credit backed securities BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Ant Financial Services Group has received approval to issue **consumer credit-backed securities** to institutional investors ..."" (emphasis added)This is a new form of contagion when a foreign government can reach across borders into a foreign market without notice  or interference. A foreign 'bank' become a vector for plague.While I applaud Masa for bravery, I recognize he has obligations he cannot escape without risking formal Regulatory interference. He wants to be the M2M IoT  Bot King yet cannot escape the pesky Human services with all its cumbersome and expensive Regulations.By off-loading some debt to New Owners seeking to clean-up their own books and willing to pay a Premium for the privilege, Masa is gaining TIME.Combes can help engineer the sale and help select 'bankers' for Minority ownership through private placements because he knows those people.I expect that Combes will assist banks in Allied Nations to form investment funds including these other 'bankers' as a way to isolate the contagion by keeping the risk to themselves and capping the share positions.What isn't clear is how CFIUS and other REGs can 'see' and stay ahead of risk.TBD:popcorn: (back to the Library Reading Room....)",

"Good facts and insights for those interested in Permian opportunities.However, why isn't Texas Pacific Land (TPL) included in your reviews?  It's the purest Permian play with perpetual royalties from the Apache-lode area, owns more surface acreage in West Texas than any other public company (for collecting rental easements for pipelines, roads, storage) and is now pumping, pipelining and processing water needed for fracking at the super well-pads.  Royalty barrels produced has been increasing better then 30% per year and at higher wellhead prices, and that's now is only about half of the companies revenues.  Their only major expense is Federal Income Tax, which has been slashed and boosts EPS by over 20%, all done with little exploration or investing risks.",

"OBE just released this:http://bit.ly/2FL2Ov7Obsidian Energy’s corporate strategy is well defined and has the unanimous support of the Board of Directors (the“Board”). We have been organically growing the Company through the combination of sustaining a low decline production base and leveraging significant development optionality. The Company delivered strong results throughout the past year, and provided an operational update earlier this week that confirms the business plan is working. Those operational successes, along with our highly capital efficient 2018 plans, are a product of robust capital planning and a project review process with both Management and the Board. A change of course would hinder Obsidian Energy’s progress and ability to deliver on the value maximizing efforts already underway.As part of our active and ongoing communications with all stakeholders, Obsidian Energy’s Board and Management appreciate constructive shareholder input and take all views seriously. We received a letter from FrontFour in early October, which contained ideas we had already been pursuing for several months. In addition, we received a second letter from FrontFour in mid-December threatening “more aggressive public action”, unless we agreed to the addition of a mutually agreed upon Director to the Board.In the interest of avoiding a costly and distracting proxy fight and as part of the Board’s ongoing renewal process, our Board expressed a willingness to work with FrontFour regarding their views on Board composition. FrontFour had previously introduced the idea of Mr. Gordon Ritchie as a Board member, a suggestion our Board unanimously embraced due to the experience and credibility of Mr. Ritchie. Mr. Ritchie was appointed to the Board in December.Concurrently, the Board interviewed candidates proposed by FrontFour and mutually agreed to the addition of one of those individuals. The appointment was accompanied with the same standstill agreement executed by our latest Board addition, Mr. Edward (Ed) H. Kernaghan. Despite extensive negotiations, FrontFour was unwilling to execute the agreement. As a result, we were unable to add the mutually agreed upon candidate to the Board.One of the primary roles of our Board is to represent the interests of all shareholders. As indicated by our recent appointment of Mr. Kernaghan, our largest shareholder, we are supportive of ownership representation on the Board. Obsidian Energy’s Board is now comprised of nine highly qualified and experienced directors, eight of whom are independent, including the Acting Chair. As part of our ongoing Board and governance process, the Governance Committee will nominate directors in advance of the Annual General Meeting that it believes will serve in the best interests of all shareholders.We look forward to continuing to deliver strong results on behalf of shareholders.",

"FrontFour Capital Expresses Concerns Regarding Obsidian Energy (OBE)January 17, 2018 8:07 AM FrontFour Capital Group LLC together with its affiliates today commented on recent developments related to Obsidian Energy Ltd. (NYSE: OBE). FrontFour and its principals are significant long-term shareholders of Obsidian, collectively beneficially owning over 28 million outstanding shares, representing approximately 5.7% of Obsidian's outstanding capital.As previously disclosed in its Schedule 13D filing of November 20, 2017, on October 5, 2017, after significant dialogue with Obsidian CEO David French on the Company's development plan within the Willesden Green Cardium, as well as with numerous Obsidian directors in reaction to Obsidian's analyst day presentation and SEC lawsuit, FrontFour sent to the board of directors (the ""Board"") of Obsidian a letter outlining its significant concerns with Obsidian's capital plan, strategic direction and value proposition to investors. FrontFour's specific concerns included but were not limited to:(i) the belief that Obsidian's capital program was highly flawed and has negatively impacted Obsidian's current valuation due to an emphasis on an integrated waterflood approach to developing the Cardium as opposed to a shorter cycle strategy focused on more rapidly growing Obsidian's light oil production;(ii) the decision to spend minimal capital on drilling and completing new wells in the Cardium and Viking during the first half of 2017, resulting in sequential declines in light oil production throughout the year;(iii) Obsidian's positioning of the Peace River joint venture as a continued core focus of capital deployment post expiry of the remaining capital carry in lieu of spending capital to grow its light oil and liquids production; and(iv) Obsidian's inability to dispose of or improve the operations within its non-core legacy gas-weighted production.Due to these concerns and in light of our significant long-term shareholdings in Obsidian, FrontFour also requested board representation. Despite FrontFour's tireless efforts over the last three months to come to an amicable agreement with Obsidian's management team and Board on the addition to the Board of ONE mutually agreed upon independent nominee proposed by FrontFour, we have been unable to come to an agreement that would avoid a needlessly costly and distracting proxy fight. It became apparent to FrontFour during our negotiations that the Board is divided on strategy and that certain directors are entrenched, which is surprising given their aversion to share ownership and long-term track record of underperformance.We welcomed Obsidian's January 15, 2018 press release, which featured strong primary well performance out of the bioturbated interval within the Willesden Green Cardium and an accelerated 2018 Cardium program via the reallocation of capital from vertical waterflood injectors. Both initiatives are consistent with our private suggestions to management and our dialogue with the Board. We note that the Company made no mention of this approach in their recently released 5-year capital plan, which is less than seven months old. We believe that continued shareholder engagement is necessary, especially in light of Obsidian's ill-timed hedging strategy of selling essentially ALL of its 2018 light oil production via fixed price swaps at prices of ~$52 per barrel, which has led to material mark to market losses. This decision has created additional headwinds to equity performance as Obsidian has continued to underperform its peers, who are benefitting from the recent increase in crude prices. Despite Obsidian's vast resource base, it is clear that investors are struggling to find the equity compelling relative to its peers given the Company's below average growth rate, underwater hedge program, muddled capital plan, and lack of dividend.FrontFour believes that a significant overhaul of Obsidian is necessary, including the streamlining of the portfolio via dispositions, and the high grading of the capital program to drive robust light oil and liquids growth within Obsidian's dominant Cardium position and vast Mannville footprint. Obsidian has the potential to be a standout light oil growth player and Cardium champion through a dramatic transformation that we believe will unlock significant value for all shareholders. To this end, FrontFour is currently considering all available options, including seeking changes to the composition of the Board at Obsidian's 2018 Annual Meeting.",

The market valuation can be a lot less rational than some people think, market pricing is hardly science, but more like alchemy, as Mr. Soros  likes to put it. The negative bias on the company from PWE times will take some time to be dissolved. So far, asset sales, management change, and SEC settlement all have helped. However, several more quarters of steady execution will be needed to turn the sentiment around. I did an arbitrage trade on the Bankers Petroleum take over, signs are pointing to me that if the share prices fails to reflect fundamentals in the next few quarters assuming steady execution and stable commodity price, it is very likely the company will be taken over.",

At least they sent out a positive press release. My family has an average cost of $10.00 USD.

"I have always been pulling for PWE/OBE, and with rising oil and a smart management team they should bring great returns to shareholders in the next few years!! I am now accumulating shares again!",
I reviewed the Operational update and must say I am even more bullish than I already was. One thing the author does not mention is that the majority of the oil production is light oil which is based on Edmonton par pricing not WCS. The Differentials to Edmonton par pricing are it as wide as WCS which means the bulk of the oil is receiving reasonable pricing.Their ability to grow production easily within cash flow is the story and the margins on extra production are very strong.I think the big activist shareholders are a good way for management's feet to be held to the fire and I am sure this update is a sign of their expectations to be responsive to investor questions and concerns.I like OBE's prospects and am just awaiting for the market to recognize the opportunity.,

"@Petdoc, I agree with you that “it is a wash”.  Whether the iPhone user decides to buy a new phone or replaces the battery on an old phone, the amount of lithium and cobalt used for the battery will be similar.  All 650 million iPhones will account for a small fraction (e.g. 20%) of lithium and cobalt used by electrical vehicles.  The lithium ion battery problem is also not limited to iPhones.  There are more Android phones than iPhones and Android phones have the same battery problems as the iPhone.  Tablets, laptop computers, rechargeable tools, and many other products use lithium ion batteries.  Finally, almost everybody I know carries an external lithium battery to charge their phone batteries.  In many cases, the battery that people carry are bigger than the battery in their iPhone.  I suspect that the iPhone battery exchange is a tiny part (<1%) of a much larger lithium battery problem.Apple’s decision to exchange the batteries is good for the environment because it provides strong incentives for people to get their batteries replaced by Apple.  Apple will recycle the used batteries whereas many people who have old iPhones may not dispose of their batteries properly and the lithium and cobalt ends up in dumps and not being recycled.  Each ton of lithium ion battery yields about $25,000 of lithium-cobalt oxide. Despite the high value of products gained from recycling lithium cobalt, many countries are struggling to meet the goal of recycling even 25% of the lithium ion batteries.  Current lithium ion battery recycling is not particularly efficient.  Lithium ion batteries are usually recycled in the following steps.  First, the batteries are heated at 700˚C to calcinate the cobalt, lithium, and copper components and to destroy any organic compounds in the battery.  Second the calcined material (salts and oxides) are treated with strong acids to leach out the metal ions.  Finally, the hydrogen peroxide is used reduce the acid.  This process can usually extract 50% of the lithium and 25% of the cobalt (http://bit.ly/2FKVa3V). In theory, however, a lithium ion battery could be almost completely recycled.  For example, in 2003, Recupyl S.A. had developed a method that recovered 90% of the lithium ion battery by pyrometallurgic approach.  Most lithium ion batteries use cobalt cathodes but some lithium ion batteries use manganese, iron phospate, or nickel cathodes.  Recycling lithium ion batteries is complex and dangerous because if lithium comes into contact with water, it explodes or lithium byproducts compounds form highly toxic materials.  For example, the salt LiPF6 forms the highly toxic hydrofluoric acid when it contacts water.  Thus, each of the products of lithium separation must be safely separated and processed.  The batteries must also be discharged before recycling, which is usually done by bathing the batteries in conductive liquid solutions before the batteries are crushed, shredded in an inert atmosphere, separated by flotation, and handpicked to remove recyclable materials such as cathodes. The material is then further separation by sieves, magnetism, electrostatic charge, eddy currents, thermal treatment, chemical processes (dissolution, leaching, solvent extraction, precipitation, and electrochemical extraction), then extractive metallurgy (http://bit.ly/2rbpP7h).  With sufficient volume of presorted batteries, Apple could work with recycling companies to achieve 90% recycling of their batteries. Finally, I doubt that many other companies could or would have made the decision of replacing batteries on their old iPhones.  By replacing the batteries, Apple is lengthening the life cycle of its products.  Many people will now be holding onto their iPhones and iPads for 4-5 years instead of 2-3 years.  Apple is perhaps the only company in the world that can afford and is able to implement this decision.  The decision benefits Apple for the following reasons.  First, longer life cycles justify higher purchase prices.  For example, an iPhone X used for 5 years costs $200/year.  Second, Apple receives payment for each customer using their products.  Suppose that an Apple customer pays $500/year for iPhone services (including $200 for iCloud, $100 for Apple Music, $300 for apps and subscriptions).  If 500 million customers pay $500/year each, that adds up to $250 billion per year.  Third, it pays for the repair infrastructure of Apple products.  Fourth, the policy brings people and traffic to the Apple Stores.  I was just at an Apple Store in New Jersey and saw over hundred of customers coming into the Apple store between 8-9 pm at a shopping mall.  All the other stores in the mall were empty.",
Do we even know how many of the 650 million iPhone owners eligible for a $29 replacement battery would have had their battery replaced anyhow at the original $79 price rather than pop $600-1000 for a new phone? Do we even know how much Apple is “losing” here? The fact that I can buy a DIY iPhone replacement battery kit with tools for $22.99 on Amazon leads me to believe that iPhone batteries aren’t all that expensive.,

Don't expect too many people to take advantage of this replacement program.,
"The biggest issue with the battery replacement is how much it hurts iPhone sales.   The biggest reason someone replaces a phone is battery not lasting and the phone slowing down.The #1 and #2 reason to get a new phone is fixed with the $29 battery.   Apple already has the Kantar numbers with a 10% decline in share in the US in Nov.   15% in UK in Nov.   So weak demand for the iPhone X.http://bit.ly/2mpBJ6JClick the country and then slide the bar to a year earlier.Then we had the report from GameStop for weak iPhone X demand.""GameStop's stock drops after revealing large charge related iPhone X-related woes""http://on.mktw.net/2r4...Then we had the widespread reports from suppliers decreasing component orders.With all of that and then the battery replacement program it is hard to see 2018 getting Apple back to growth.  I joined SA in 2015 and shared my concerns on Apple and since that time we can see worse results in 2016 and 2017 after I shared my concerns.http://bit.ly/2f7c6c0But it is just Apple.  I also shared my feelings on Google, Amazon and FB and all are growing quickly.  Here is the chart for Google and you can see accelerated growth.http://bit.ly/2l16djlWould never tell anyone to sell but these are important data points to understand with Apple.   It is looking like 2015 will continue to be the peak with Apple.",

Really irritated me and made me think twice about getting another iPhone after this.",
"For the record, Iphone batteries are out of stock right now in France due to the strong demand !",
Good except Apple won’t replace a non apple battery if you have had it replaced outside Apple,
"The phone will work very well with the new battery and the 16gb capacity.that it has, which is probably full.",
Apple's battery plan doesn't work as stated at Apple Plum Point store in FL. I traveled 3 hours there and back only to be told they would have to order one 5-10 days and then make another appointment. The 1st appointment took a week in half  and I asked if they had batteries and the 2nd will be the same for a $29 battery that I should be able to change out myself. I will never own an apple product again. Let the sheep follow apple over the cliff.,

"Sorry slight mathematical blunder - that should read 1950 metric tons, however, this is still significant as the US geological survey estimates global production for 2016, the latest year for which figures are available as 35,000 metric tons. It should be noted that it takes a minimum of two years to bring new production on line if one uses the cheaper of the two methods of production, brine evaporation, and possibly longer if you are going to dig the various ores which hold lithium out of the ground and then process them.One might also like to know that my model S Tesla has approx. 64kg of lithium carbonate in its batteries, so in 2018 the more expensive Teslas' will require 6400 metric tons of lithium carbonate; and there is of course the prospect of say 350,000 cheaper Teslas, in say 2019, and they can't have appreciably smaller batteries, so let's say another 17,000 metric tons, and certainly in China they will produce 500,000 EV.s, so that's another 22,500 tons of lithium carbonate.Gosh there is going to be a bit of a shortage of lithium carbonate in 2018/19/20 to say the least.",

"One problem most people will not bother to replace their battery. Apple would not have lowered the price if they felt everyone was going to do it. It was purely a smart PR move nothing more. I'm willing to guess that less than 10% of the iPhone 6 users will even replace their battery. Most people can not even bother. Both my kids are on 6's and I asked them if they wanted new batteries and they both said no, they said they usually keep their phone charged and have not seen a problem.I would no attempt to cash in on this that is for sure.",
"My understanding is that 1000 i phones require roughly 3KG of lithium carbonate, so on your figures, this equates to 1,950,000 tons of lithium carbonate, also being required.",

"People who have made good gains on this recent run up should take some profits just to manage your risk.   Every time TGT takes a move lots of people say ""add more""....this has been going on for years and they get caught buying in at the top assuming, based on nothing, that the stock will hit some crazy target price ""because"".And spend time understanding current consumer debt issues and potential impact on retail.  China had a 6.5% GDP growth last year but consumer debt has grown to the point where consumer spending is pulling back.   Canada this week has taken action to try to get consumer debt in check.  US is doing nothing.Give yourself a reality check.  And make sure your portfolio is balanced if the recent big gain has over sized your TGT position.  If you are managing your portfolio properly you have an established $ amount for a ""position"".  You may, in some instances hold a stock at a position and a half or double....but that should only be in the case where there is a high degree of probability that the stock will continue to march forward  (Brookfield Asset Management is one I have where I have done that...TGT would never fit in that category).",

I second that. Tgt will probably cool a bit in the coming days. The valuation of 90 is OK if the earnings trend is up and this is hard to do with AMZ and WMT undercutting everything.,

You can probably make the case that when in was in the mid 50's it was undervalued, and now it's closer to full value. However, the daily outsized moves of 3% + have become common for Target, and I can't help but feel like they're only one more own goal away from another collapse. Will be interesting to see how the stock moves after earnings, although I think quite a bit had already been baked in following the guidance update. I sold Jan'19 calls at 70 strike the day of the guidance raise.

"Just saw some interesting data. On Apple TV (where over 50% apps are paid or require that you  subscribe somewhere) the top grossing apps include Beach Body on Demand at (9th), AcornTV - British TV app (14th) and Crunchyroll - Anime (15th). Those all rank above things like History Channel, Hallmark Channel and the NHL channel. Beach Body even beats the NBA app which is ranked 10th. On Apple TV, Apple takes a portion of subscription fees from apps like Netflix, Hulu and TV everywhere apps and those are ranked at the top (Netflix - 1, HBO - 2 , etc)Since successful apps are generally the same across platforms, we can assume that Roku's situation (not for Netflix, but for apps they actually get revenue from) is similar. This should provide substantial proof that the prevailing short-seller idea that Roku's thousands of channels bring no value is entirely false, and that in fact, those channels provide a significant advantage vis a vis other platforms that don't have a good selection of apps",

"This article/show contains numerous contradictions and little factual basis. For example, Mr. Kramer contends that you don't need a roku to access the only shows that his household ever watches (Netflix/YouTube) and that these devices are just commodities. His general argument for why he knows these things is that he's had a Roku for two years and subscribed to Netflix for a number of years. The reality is quite a bit different. 1) Roku is a commodity in the same way that a device that runs MacOS or iOS is a commodity. The value is the proprietary operating system and the 5000 channels. IBM also thought that DOS had little value, so they gave it to Microsoft. 2) He states that Samsung TVs can do the same as Roku, so why would you even need a roku. But samsung's proprietary Tizen OS has a lot fewer apps available so it is less attractive and less valuable. While samsung has about 32% of the US TV market as of 2016. Brands that ship roku TVs comprise just under 30%. By end 2018 Roku smart TVs should have a bigger share than samsung. If Samsung concludes that not having enough apps on their smart TV platform is causing them to lose market share they have three choices. pay developers to build apps for their channel (like AMZN and MSFT do when they launch a new platform), switch to something else like Roku, or do nothing and hope roku goes away because it is a commodity product and people have decided to buy something that offers them no value.3) As far as content goes, the author states that he doesn't use anything but Netflix and YouTube. And the only time he sees ads is when his kids play 1980s era pacman on the roku (which you can't do on samsung tizen). The point here being that lots of people watch 1-2 of those zero value channels/apps/games. And at any given moment they may browse to see what else they can find, which makes those 5000 apps a valuable enterprise.4) the author asks how does Roku make money going forward? Well the current ARPU is about $15/user. So that is not zero. It is also proof of what I say in (3). Lots of people are watching those 1000s of channels with ""no value"". That ARPU is growing by something like 40%/yearIt's really difficult to pull together all the numbers that make the case for Roku. They're not readilly available.. I've been using roku for seven years, but that's not how I know that it has vast growth potential. I know because about 18 months ago I had to do the research for work, and have been updating it ever since.",

Of course he would, and why would he say anything else, even if he did want to sell the company?

"dan311:  I think the rhetorical question that you ask in your message post is exactly the reason why NYCB's stock price and the recent announcement of the SIFI threshold going to be raised to 250 billion dollars has not had any positive upward stock price movement for NYCB when one would think that the threshold being raised would.  The investor community must be worried about the Fed's determination to increase interest rates having a negative effect on NYCB and NYCB not being able to offset the rising interest rates.  Hopefully, Ficalora can figure things out.",
Is potential asset growth thanks to the new Dodd frank adjustment going to be enough to offset the negative impact rising rates have on nycb? That’s a major trend that seems to go against nycb because of their own interest payment liabilities exceeding the delayed upside from charging customers a higher interest rate,
Good article sir,
$7.87 I believe.,
Can someone tell me what the current book value is for NYCB as of 9/30/2017?,
"Not sure who would want them right now...loan to deposit ratio is quite high and NIM is in the tank.  Check out OZRK printing pretty good results today (and NIM that blows away NYCB) but still got dinged.  Will be interesting to see the reaction once NYCB reports.Likely the dividend folks will get what they want, and NYCB will stay stuck in the mud.",
"I think this management team is too smug. Unimaginative and underachieving while over-managing minutia.Ten years is a long time to have waited for SIFI to change, while blowing away hundreds of millions $ in preparation. This dog should be the acquired, not be the acquiring bank. With a solid NYC presence it should fetch a nice premium, something in the order of $23-25 p/s",
"Good article and I agree with the basic premise though it may take a while to fully implement.  I do not yet see that dynamic drive in management that this bank badly needs.  Still, Long NYCB and holding as they do pay a decent dividend while waiting.",
"I'd be happy to see them do it the old way.  The share price went up albeit slowly, and I got my 5% dividend.  That's why I bought it at a good enough time, about 13.12, and as a retired guy I like the income.  It will go up again anyway.",
I'm also in NYCB for the dividend.,
I'm in NYCB for the 5% dividend...,
"Respectfully take issue with many of the points in the article.  First, and most importantly, ""raising rates"" is hurting, not helping NYCB by squeezing their net interest margin.  This stuff about SIFI getting raised and blaming that is getting old, as stated above.  The real problem is that their business model kind of stinks right now due to the low margins.There is also this issue with the dividend being touted, yet it is eating up nearly all operating profits which could be used for the growth that shareholders desire.  A catch-22 therefore: cut the dividend and upset the long time shareholders to restart growth, or maintain the dividend and stay stuck in a trading range.",
"Why compare NYCB with SIVB? SIVB is a very atypical bank, operating in a much different lending environment.  That said, NYCB's performance over the last 10 years has been poor compared to virtually all other banks.  The stock price is flat and the dividend is down 30%.  Not many banks can claim those achievements.A point the author overlooks is the fact that NYCB's ""currency"" as an acquirer has been severely impacted by the fact that target banks have appreciated in value at the same time NYCB has depreciated, making accretive acquisitions that much more difficult.  That's different from the ""good old days"" of NYCB's serial acquisitions.  Also, NYCB's lending niche & efficiency ratio are such that a potential acquirer would be hard pressed to realize significant synergies & savings by taking over NYCB's business.  Time and an improving economic backdrop may help NYCB break out of its multi-year malaise, but it's hard to buy into the author's take-it-to-the-bank optimism.",
I will believe it when I see it again waiting for the government to make any changes!  What a waste of time for so many years what about that! Same old ways who says it will work? I pray they get bought out and we can all end this misery together and make some good money and never talk about them anymore !,
You missed one acquisition: Synergy,
"Brooklyn Nomad:  I agree that ""this sh_t with SIFI is getting old,"" but you have to admit that what the author writes is the truth.  If SIFI threshold gets lifted, NYCB becomes a market mover again in terms of stock price and bank acquisitions.  I think the real question for a NYCB shareholder is what if the SIFI threshold is not raised?  Then, I think that what you write ""someone buy NYCB"" becomes the only logical solution for a NYCB shareholder to see stock price appreciation.",

Else, do your objective DD on GILD and verify if you are able to reasonably project future prospects, invest in it at a good entry point and watch your portfolio grow! In my opinion, cannot say if GILD goes back to ~$70 but in long term I can see this stock go much higher. I am happy to be invested in GILD, let it 'DRIP' here and wait.

Great article. I'm very long GILD and feel that patience is the best play here. It's a matter of 'when' not 'if' it goes back to $100.00Also agree with several commenters that the dividend will keep rising 10% per year. Could be $0.70 per share x 4 in a few years easily. And that's a 2.8% on a $100 stock. Pure gold.,
It's up only 3%+.  There is 100%+ to go this year.  Epic short covering!!!,
"GILD has been a FCF story for the last bunch of years. The large annual FCF gives the company outstanding opportunities to create long term value for shareholders through increased R&D, increased dividends, buybacks, market expansions and M&A.

There is several potential tailwinds with another acquisition, full rollout of KITE and HCV in China, NASH approval.",
Thanks for the mention. Glad to see Gilead getting it’s due. It would be great for long suffering shareholders if Gilead’s share price woke up as you suggest.,
"Good article thanks. I'm thinking the Chinese HCV market may surprise shareholders (in a good way) - I know GILD just missed inclusion on the recent 2018 prescription lists, but the market there is so huge, it just seems the potential is being downplayed quite heavily. As Goalkick9 mentioned, I would not be at all surprised to see a dividend raise announced in the very near future - although their dividend history is somewhat brief, they have nevertheless maintained a steady increase of around 10% every year, so my guess would be GILD upping it to around $0.58 or $0.60 a quarter starting with the 03/30/2018 payment date. They certainly have the cashflow to cover it easily.I believe their cash pile is substantially bigger than the $11B stated in this article - that is just cash and cash equivalents - they also have substantial long term investments. Prior to the KITE deal, they were cash positive, so the cash pile is somewhere around $20B plus, I believe.Also don't forget they are still pulling in north of $10B in NET income every year even without M&A and new pipelines / revenue streams - this number always seems to be overlooked, the focus instead being solely on the decrease in HCV revenues the last couple of years.Taking these factors into account, personally I think GILD is heavily undervalued relative to industry peers. Looking at the potential coming down the pike, and ""heavily undervalued"" doesn't begin to cover it.I am most definitely long on GILD, and continue to accumulate.",
"A very thorough analysis, thank you.Interesting that you do not forecast an increase in the dividend payout. I do, if nothing else to maintain the yield against a rising share price. And I'd be surprised to see that $8.2B buyback authorization fully deployed, or anywhere close to it. I don't think the burned fingers from the 2016 repurchase have healed yet.Also worth noting another value GILD brings to a doddering bull market -- a limited downside risk given the undervaluation. I'm not sure that investors looking for a two-year double will put GILD high on their list, but those who are nervous about a significant market correction just might.",2018 Is Gilead's Year

"AK Steel post-fire outage may pinch spot marketJan 22, 2018 | 01:41 PMNEW YORK — US spot-market steel sheet supplies may tighten in the aftermath of a fire at AK Steel's Middletown Works that started when molten metal spilled at the mill's basic oxygen furnace.As a result of the blaze on Saturday January 20, melt-shop operations at the Ohio mill will be down for eight to 10 days, AK Steel said in a press release Monday.""We anticipate the outage will reduce our sales to the commodity carbon spot market,"" AK Steel said in the statement. Contract customers, including automotive buyers, are not expected to experience an impact on shipments, according to the West Chester, Ohio-based company.The fire was caused by a ladle malfunctioning at the caster and ""releasing liquid steel,"" the statement said.The accident was reported at 8:01 a.m., city of Middletown assistant fire chief Thomas Snively told American Metal Market. The mill's own fire brigade immediately began spraying water on the flowing liquid steel, but not before it had ignited some unspecified machinery, he said.""The AK Steel people ... had lines on the molten steel when we arrived,"" Snively said. ""The idea is to confine it to that building. It's applying water as much as you can to form a crust to keep it from spreading.""It took about 30 firefighters from four municipal departments 2½ hours to bring the blaze under control. One Middletown fire lieutenant was treated at a hospital for a minor injury, Snively said. The steelworkers were evacuated, and none was hurt.AK Steel said melt shops at the company's Dearborn Works and Butler Works would help to serve customers' needs.A prolonged outage may cause automotive customers to shift some orders to the mill's competitors, Philip Gibbs, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a research alert Monday. Potentially benefiting would be ArcelorMittal, U.S. Steel, Stelco, Ternium or even Posco Mexico. The blaze also could ""further stoke market psychology"" at a time when US domestic sheet prices already have soared for other reasons.""Should Middletown's slab casting be significantly sidelined, it could positively enhance near-term pricing sentiment in the US sheet market."" Gibbs wrote.American Metal Market's hot-rolled coil index stands at $35.32 per hundredweight ($706.40 per ton), already its highest level since 2012. The index has risen in 12 of the past 14 weeks.AK Steel's predecessor, Armco, was founded at the Middletown site in 1899. An unplanned idling resulting from mechanical failure at the Middletown Works blast furnace in 2013 contributed to persistent quarterly losses. A scheduled outage at the mill in 2015 was pulled forward due to poor market conditions.AK Steel Holdings shares declined by as much as 10.9% in Monday morning trading before recovering most of those losses after the company press release provided the 8-to-10-day time frame for the estimated restart.",
"Does anyone know how serious an incident this is?“Damages still being assessed at AK Steel fire in Middletown”2:59 p.m Sunday, Jan. 21, 2018 News MIDDLETOWNIt will take fire officials several weeks to determine the cause and cost of a fire at AK Steel’s Middletown Works on Saturday morning that took 60 firefighters from four fire departments a few hours to put out.Company and fire officials said a cracked vessel holding molten steel ignited the large fire. According to Middletown Fire Chief Paul Lolli, the molten steel ignited other equipment and the building when it poured out at the Basic Oxygen Furnace which is located in the 3400 block of Lefferson Road at the sprawling complex.The incident was initially reported as heavy smoke coming from the structure about 8:30 a.m. During the fire, there were some reports that included molten metal reportedly flowing through the building and the second floor concrete collapsing at one point, causing crews to be removed from the first floor.Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Spaulding said the ladle holding the molten steel apparently was released before being poured into molds“There have been no employees injured — all employees have been accounted for, and cleanup efforts are underway,” a company statement said. “We are looking into the cause of the situation and have no further information at this time.”When contacted Sunday, Lisa Jester, AK Steel’s corporate communication manager, had no additional comment beyond Saturday’s statement.Spaulding said one firefighter/paramedic was taken to Atrium Medical Center for minor injuries and was treated and released.Lolli said it will take several weeks to determine what exactly happened and damage estimates at this early stage are impossible to predict.Fire departments from Middletown, Franklin, Monroe and Liberty Twp. responded to the scene.",
"Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. Addresses Inaccurate Media Reports Regarding Nashwauk, MN PropertyJanuary 21, 2018Download this Press Release (PDF)CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF) today said it is addressing inaccurate media reports related to its real estate interests located in Itasca County west of Nashwauk, Minnesota, as well as recent activities the Company performed on its own site. Cleveland-Cliffs objects to such inaccurate information and is providing the following facts about its recent activity in order to set the record straight:1) 	The Company acquired from Glacier Park Iron Ore Properties in December 2017 a combination of undivided and whole fee interests, as well as mineral and surface leases within the Biwabik Iron Formation, for a total of 3,768 acres. The public records in Itasca County provide clear confirmation that Cleveland-Cliffs Minnesota Land Development LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cleveland-Cliffs, is the owner/lessee of record of the property.2) 	The Company employed a standard practice and protocol of posting signage to identify the perimeters of its land. The activity is focused on surveying the Company’s acreage and for reasons of public safety.3) 	The signs were placed on existing fencing, posts and trees. No new fencing was erected during this process.4) 	Cliffs’ contractors legally accessed the property through public roads during daytime hours, and there was no night-time activity as alleged in the media reports.5) 	Before the activity was initiated, the Company informed the Itasca County Sheriff and other local officials of its intention to access its property and undertake the actions within its rights to survey and secure the property.6) 	Also as part of the notification process, Cliffs made an effort to hand-deliver a courtesy letter to Mesabi Metallics’ representative Robb Bigelow about the planned activity, but he rejected receiving the letter.7) 	Neither Governor Mark Dayton nor any other public official on the Iron Range have reached out to Lourenco Goncalves, Chairman, CEO and President of Cleveland-Cliffs, about the situation related to Cliffs’ acquisition of property at the Nashwauk site.Founded in 1847, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is the largest and oldest independent iron ore mining company in the United States. We are a major supplier of iron ore pellets to the North American steel industry from our mines and pellet plants located in Michigan and Minnesota. Additionally, we operate an iron ore mining complex in Western Australia. By 2020, Cliffs expects to be the sole producer of hot briquetted iron (HBI) in the Great Lakes region with the development of its first production plant in Toledo, Ohio. Driven by the core values of safety, social, environmental and capital stewardship, our employees endeavor to provide all stakeholders with operating and financial transparency.

"Cliffs works to block access to Mesabi MetallicsBy John Myers on Jan 19, 2018 at 10:26 p.m.The heated battle between Cleveland-Cliffs and Chippewa Capital Partners over a chunk of Minnesota's Iron Range spilled out of the courtroom and onto the ground outside Nashwauk this week when Cliffs erected signs to keep people off part of the Mesabi Metallics project.Cliffs employees or contractors apparently rode snowmobiles onto the site, crossing Mesabi Metallics property to erect ""No Trespassing"" signs around a disputed piece of property Cliffs claims in the middle of the Mesabi Metallics project, said Tom Clarke, CEO of Chippewa Capital Partners.Chippewa officials said Cliffs employees illegally trespassed on the Mesabi Metallics property at night and conducted ""criminal activity.""Attorneys for Chippewa are expected to contact the Itasca County Sheriff's Office about the incident, Clarke said.The battle stems from the efforts of Clarke's company, Chippewa Capital Partners, to revive the bankrupt Essar Steel Minnesota project, now called Mesabi Metallics, in Nashwauk. Clarke won the bankruptcy auction for the project last summer and in December pulled the effort out of bankruptcy court for good, signaling work would resume in earnest this spring on the $3.7 billion taconite mine and processing center and adjacent pig iron plant that, combined, could employ 350 people.But one big issue remains unresolved.Just before the December bankruptcy emergence, Cliffs announced it had purchased the interests of Glacier Park Iron Ore Properties LLC for a large piece of what was expected to be the Mesabi Metallics mine.Chippewa says Glacier Park should not have been allowed to sell the property — that access to the mineral rights should have transferred with the bankruptcy case. Cliffs argued they bought the rights after Chippewa missed an agreed-upon deadline to pay for the rights.The issue was argued in a Delaware courtroom Thursday. Federal Judge Brendan Shannon is expected to decide the matter later this month.But Cliffs didn't wait, moving this week to physically mark the property in question, allegedly trespassing to erect their own ""No Trespassing"" signs, Clarke told the News Tribune.Attorneys for Chippewa sent Cliffs notice late Thursday to stop its activities on the property and allow unfettered access to the Mesabi Metallics project, calling Cliffs' efforts ""extrajudicial harassment.""The land in dispute is in the center of Mesabi Metallics project and, if it was permanently blocked off, could thwart efforts to finish the project and mine at the site.Patricia Persico, spokeswoman for Cliffs, said Friday that erecting the signs was simply the company ""securing its purchased and leased properties on the Nashwauk site. Our main concern is for public safety. Erecting signage is standard company practice and protocol for securing the perimeters of our land and operations.""Persico said any snowmobiling activity was done during daylight hours by surveyors marking the boundaries of Cliffs' newly acquired land.""There is no illegal activity,'' she said, calling Chippewa's claims unfounded. ""There is none of that going on.""Earlier this week Cliffs also attempted to serve legal papers to Mesabi Metallics project leaders, ordering them to stay off the property in question. Similar documents also were presented to contactors entering the property to work on the massive structures that sit about half-built, Chippewa's attorneys alleged in the letter to Cliffs.""We are working to settle this amicably and then we have this just incredible behavior by Cliffs,"" Clarke told the News Tribune on Friday. ""This is a blatant effort by a desperate company trying to intimidate contractors off this project. But it's not going to work.""Clarke said the alleged late-night trespassing is part of Cliffs' ongoing effort to sabotage the Mesabi Metallics project to fend off potential competition. Mesabi Metallics promises to produce some 7 million tons of taconite pellets annually which could compete with Cliffs, currently the nation's largest producer of taconite iron ore, the main ingredient in steel made in blast furnaces.Clarke has said he will gain access to the ore under the property in question legally, or purchase it from Cliffs, or go around Cliffs and mine other land where Chippewa already has access to the ore.Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton and Iron Range lawmakers have called on Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves to stop trying to block Clarke's project and instead work with Mesabi Metallics as it develops. So far that hasn't happened.http://bit.ly/2FWGMFH",

"From our buddy Gordon:Gordon Johnson Sees Cleveland-Cliffs Below $4, Initiates With A SellCleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE: CLF) will release guidance next week, and if its figures rest on current steel prices, one analyst advises shorting.The RatingVertical Research Group analyst Gordon Johnson initiated coverage on Cleveland-Cliffs with a Sell rating and $3.87 price target.The ThesisJohnson anticipates a “sharp correction” in Cleveland-Cliffs shares over the next three to four months as China steel mill margins continue to “tank,” catalyzing plunges in iron ore prices and Cleveland Cliffs’ stock. (Seen the analyst's track record here.) “In short, with the majority of investors focusing on CLF’s coming 2018 guidance (which many expect to be impressive given where U.S. HRC/iron ore prices are today) as well as Trump’s Section 232 decision, we see the current ‘trouble’ brewing in the world’s most important steel market (i.e., China) as largely flying under the radar,” Johnson said. By his assessment, a current emphasis on U.S. scrap prices and steel-mill lead times and imports overshadows critical conditions abroad, including waning Chinese steel and Turkish scrap prices, as well as spiking steel inventory in China.These circumstances compound risk to U.S. metals and iron ore prices, as well as expectations for President Donald Trump’s upcoming Section 232 decision to strike Chinese imports.Considering similar pricing levels as those in early 2017, which initially justified encouraging guidance but eventually forced forecast reductions that halved the stock price, Johnson advised shorting on any guidance built on current hot-rolled coil and iron ore prices.http://bit.ly/2EW8KjC",
"Thank you both for the information. I am not so sure about a couple more years bull market. The biggest reason why I have got some doubts is because if the FED continues to raise the intrest, the long term bonds will have got less return than the short ones, as well as dividends from stocks. This will basically cause that the money printing by the state will be more returning than the overall economics. This will hyperinflate stocks and then crash brutally. And actually war will be the only solution. Like WW1 and WW2. History is atm repeating itsself... i actually that i will be wrong. Anyhow,... do you think DT will really invest big time into US Infrastructure? That might be the biggest bull theory argument for me.",
"We may see a large 4Q write off of “deferred tax assets”- aka CLF’s past tax loss carryforwards- due to the new tax law having much lower tax rates starting in 2018.  Such writeoffs dont affect cash, but may produce a reporting “loss”.",
"You are welcome. I think on any chances we have to watch the S&P500 and the DowJ. DowJ longterm chart looks like the 1 year bitcoin chart. So starting to have an eye on that might not hurt. Also when considering Cliffs. If the entire market goes down, cliffs will be hurt.",
"Hey Vladimir, thanks for the reports, been following for longer time via a german investment site. Was time to join here now. I've been following cliffs for more than 6 years now. You were right a lot of times the last years.👍To give you some ""feelings"" from the market in Europe. I am a CEO if a german industrial fan producer. We feel a lot of demand for machinery for new steel, aluminium and copper furnace plants for the middle east, asia and some in the US. The biggest german steel producers asking to optimize and remodel their production sites. There is a huge demand in the market right now. I expect the US Industry local2local will rise, good for Cliffs, because European Companies become more and more aware/afraid of doing business in the US-> Due to DT politics. Maybe you want to look also to Europe for your reports. Btw our order intake from Asia for steel and copper machinery is up by 20% in 2017 compared to 2016.(I guess it is because China is closing older sites due to new laws concerning environmental protection. China is changing rapidly these days. From 2018 on they stop buying plastic trash from germany. Etc. Etc. Salaries increase by 12-15% each year. The cheap chinese steel might be over sooner than we can imagine)Best regards,Marius",
"Great Lakes iron ore shipments soar in 2017....CHICAGO — The Great Lakes iron ore trade notched its best year since 2012 last year.Great Lakes iron ore shipments totaled approximately 60.3 million tons in 2017, up 10.8% from 54.4 million tons 2016 and 4.7% above a five-year average of 57.6 million tons, according to the Lake Carriers’ Association.Annual ore shipments had not risen above 60 million tons since they weighed in at 61.6 million tons in 2012, according to data from the group.Loadings at US ports totaled 55.8 million tons in 2017, up 13.4% from the prior year. Those gains were offset in part by a decline in shipments from Canadian ports along the St. Lawrence Seaway. Canadian shipments fell to 4.6 million tons, down 12.4% from 5.2 million tons in 2016, the association said.Higher US ore shipments came despite the closure of Empire Mine in Palmer, Michigan, which exhausted its mineral reserves and shipped its final cargo on April 18, the group said.The Empire Mine, which had served Cleveland Cliffs and ArcelorMittal, had been in operation since 1963.With Empire shuttered, all US-mined iron ore destined for blast furnaces in Indiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania transited through locks in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The result: Lake Superior ports that move ore through the “Soo Locks” saw shipments increase by 9.9 million tons, or 23.6%, the Lake Carriers’ Association said.The association represents companies whose vessels move commodities - including steelmaking raw materials such as iron ore, fluxstone and coal - across the Great Lakes.Ore shipments often trend in the same direction as steel prices.Polar vortex redux?Another wild card to keep an eye on is the weather, the mill source said. Ice and extreme cold are hard on equipment and workers. And if the severe weather continues, it could to lead to production disruptions.The Great Lakes have been hit by an early and record-setting wave of cold weather, and the lakes are freezing at a faster pace than normal, according to local media reports.Mills typically have enough ore stockpiled to hold them over until well into March, when shipping typically resumes on the Great Lakes. If the region is hit by more cold fronts, it’s possible that the lakes could remain frozen for longer than normal - and that opening of shipping lanes might be delayed, the mill source said.That happened in 2014 and hobbled production in the Great Lakes region after mills in both the US and Canada burned through their winter inventories and were unable to bring ships across the lakes to restock",

A company with the financial power and market position of an Exxon needs to be involved in this solar transition.,
"[With increased efficiency and lower costs changing the estimated payback on solar panels to 6-8 years, solar panels are an economical decision for all new businesses and homes.]  Yep, I agree with this statement.  I put up a 6-string system, 85 Enphase microinverters, and since 2013, I have had no utility bill, have been grandfathered in at an NEM retail rate of $0.12/kW, and my ROI is about 6-years.  For new solar systems with ~20% efficiency, higher wattage panels, higher AC wattage microinverters, and lower hardware costs overall, solar PV has never been a wiser choice to make.  With the 1% statistic, it really paints a virgin market landscape held back only be reverse incentives and bureaucracy.  The 30% Fed ITC is still good through 2023, and once we get past the solar tariff b.s., the solar industry should continue its phenomenal growth; the solar industry alone is the largest growth industry over all of the fossil fuel industries combined.Another fact I find interesting about the SunPower story is how in the past successive quarters, SunPower has gone from 67-, 85- to over 90% of its residential product portfolio as being AC Module-based.  AC Modules are truly the next evolution in the solar arena; simplicity at its finest.  Enphase Energy has teamed up with LG, Jinko Solar, Waaree Energies Ltd. and others to produce brand-name AC Module products.  When it comes to an AC Module product, SunPower's 96-cell panel ACM with a SolarBridge Technologies microinverter is a powerful product, but I'd still rather have the leading microinverter company's MLPE under my solar panel of choice.  Furthermore with regards to Enphase's latest IQ technology, the PLC using IQ is a better technique over PDM/FSK modulation when it comes to system installation and monitoring activities; the 2-wire IQ configuration is less costly in terms of wiring and provides for faster installation over the 4-wire SunPower AC Module systems.Nevertheless, if both SunPower, and Enphase with its partners, can continue to prove the Holy Grail of solar installation with its microinverter-based AC Modules, then all-in-one AC Modules will dominate the solar landscape eventually; the Holy Grail of solar installations is 2 installs per day with a 3-man crew, and AC Modules make that possible!!  Faster installations, lower cost, increased productivity, greener world!",

"Fluidsdoc, Fossilfuel & Others... just throwing some more thoughts out there.  1.)  I listened to the conference call.  I was impressed.  2.)  Management touts its fracking database as a competitive advantage.  I'm interested in hearing a professional opinion.  Is this fracking database really a competitive advantage?  If so, in what sense?  Does it allow LBRT to command a higher dayrate?  Or, does it just get them in the door to bid their offering?  3.)  LBRT claims their ongoing maintenance is significantly less than competitors and they focus on a total cost of ownership approach.  Is this for real?  4.)  On this message thread, I read two criticisms of LBRT.  Interestingly, both say that management adjusted their practices.  This strikes me as a good point.  Am I missing anything?",
"Beausefus, WTTR is one of my favorite stocks and largest positions.  Since you know all about the softer Q4, I will restrict my comments to other issues.  - You are correct that water is essential.  The reason I think that it is overlooked is because there is only one publicly traded water company.  Other water companies will eventually go public, and water will be its own sub-sector, but for now Select is sui generis.  Just look at how few people follow it on on SA.  - Water demand will essentially track sand demand.  There is no doubt that water demand will grow substantially in 2018-2020.  But , unlike sand, you don't have everyone and their mother rushing in to create a new sand mine.  That's what really scares me about sand.  We all know the demand is there, but so is the supply.- WTTR is a beneficiary of more pressure pumping HHP.  Even if the pressure pumping market becomes oversupplied, WTTR will still be a beneficiary.  (I don't see the pressure pumping market becoming over supplied until 2019-2020 at the earliest.  - Here is an important and sophisticated point that I do not believe the market understands yet.  Select requires relatively modest maintenance capex and therefore will have a tremendous amount of free cash flow.  For 2018, they will $160mm of depreciation.  Against that, they will only require $80mm of maintenance capex.  Thus, their quality of earnings is very high because their depreciation substantially exceeds their reinvestment requirements.  (They are also investing another $80mm in growth capex, but that will increase revenue capacity.)  - 2018 operating income of $200mm could be all free cash flow.  I would expect the company to make more acquisitions. IMO, Select has a much better competitive dynamic.  It is 4-5x the size of its nearest competitor, and you don't have dozens of bit players trying to open up water companies.  It also has a much higher quality of earnings and much greater free cash flow.  None of the analysts are talking about this yet, but I believe this means that WTTR should sell at a much greater meaningful.  If sand players are at 4-5x and pressure pumpers are at 6-7x, the WTTR should be 8-10x.",
"Bert, what are your thoughts on select energy's value now that it has pulled back? q4 and eoy earnings were below expectations but Nov's merger with rockwater is a big win and they are best positioned with operations at every basin.

Am I missing something? Your insight and opinion is second to none. Thanks!",

"One of the topical issues this earnings season has been maintenance capex.  LBRT's fleet is very new (2016-17 vintage equipment) and their maintenance capex needs are modest.  According to Goldman, their predictive analytics data helps guide them to a maintenance capex spend that is 1/3 of their peers.  We'll see how that evolves over time, but it is clear that this company is using technology to improve both its and its customers' efficiency.  Current enterprise value of $2.1 billion versus 2018 EBITDA estimate of $532 million and 2019 EBITDA estimate of $620 million.",
"After a strong IPO pop, LBRT has traded done close to its IPO price.  I decided to do the analysis and this made me take a meaningful position in the stock.

I was very impressed with LBRT.  They are doing the right things the right way with the right customers.  This is resulting in 57% higher frac stages per month than the industry average and their Q3 revenue of $21.7mm/HHP was 41% above the peer group.  With the stock down from $24 to $17, and set against Goldman Sachs' price target of $34, this is a pretty attractive opportunity.",

"So, for all you out there who actually understand all of this, let's cut to the chase.  Would you buy NCS stock on the premise that its technology will be widely adopted by U.S. shale drillers.  The company missed its Q3 pretty good and numbers are coming down.  The analyst commentary is bullish but acknowledging that U.S. adoption is slower than expected.  So what gives?  Is it a niche technology or is market adoption going to increase significantly in 2018-19?",
"Fluidsdoc, thanks...  NCS is a relatively expensive company for two reasons: first, it has an asset-light business model and earns a superior return on capital; second, the perception is they will be able to grow rapidly by entering the U.S. market.  (They are currently primarily a Canadian company.)  So, the issue is whether they are more than a niche company.  The bull story is that pinpoint fracking will improve flow rates.  If that's true, it would seem that it would/could be widely adopted.  But you seem to be saying no, it is just a niche technology.  Am I reading you right?  I encourage you to write an article because I am trying to figure this one out.",

But I can't help but feel there's an underlying theme or concept he's hinting at that's going over my head as someone that lacks real world experience in oil fields.

"A couple years ago, my brother worked for Liberty in the Bakken.  He was a white hat, decently senior with the company, getting set up to run his own crew.  Before Liberty, he worked wireline, so he knew the whole pad.One day, he called me on the phone and told me he was walking down the road.  Evidently, Liberty wasn't being safe in it's operations, and he walked off the site.  Disturbing.He's with a wireline company now in the Permian ( they also work the Bakken ), and runs a wireline crew.  I think he is happy that he walked away.Evidently, Liberty changed a few of it's practices, because of his walk off.

"I would own LRBT if I had moved quicker during the first trading day of the IPO. It was already up 24% when I looked so I decided to let the foam subside. I say this because I recently used LRBT in South Texas. I liked the following aspects:  (1) all equipment is essentially new or close to it; (2) their use of ""sand boxes"" for frac sand, which helps track inventory -- huge improvement over the old truck it and dump it; (3) customer-focused science -- they dove into the area, pulled up frac information for offsetting operators (competitors) and analyzed the data to ascertain the most important drivers (a nod here to ""big data"" fans). Together, we designed the frac program for our wells. This is in contrast to the ""Big Colors"" (see article above) who will pump their recipe for the frac but don't ask too many questions or ask for special sauce. On the flip side, what I didn't care for:  (1) recent entrants to the South Texas market so their supply chain had some hiccups; and (2) the command and control structure at the wellsite was less than optimal, they needed to revamp it (and they did on the fly when we criticized it).Being in the midst of current operations, and having almost 40 years in the business, I disagree with the pending bubble pronouncement. My direct experience is that the bigger boys are all booking longer term arrangements with large clients (Chevron and Conoco Phillips, for example) leaving no available crews or dates for us independents. Therefore, we smaller players have LOTS of work to pick up as many wells are drilled by independents without years-long drilling programs. We might drill a six-well program and then pause and assess rather than a multi-rig, multi-year program. Of course larger frac companies want to book that long-term, ""sure thing"" business, who wouldn't? My point is that there remains plenty of demand for frac services and I've seen no evidence to temper that need in the next 12 to 18 months for sure. Yes, LBRT is riskier as compared to a HAL because it is a ""pure play"" frac company. But, it is well managed, not debt laden and expanding at a considered pace where it knows the market is strong. And, look at the HAL P/E in the article! In conclusion, I give LRBT 4 out of 5 ""shiny frac trucks"" and endorse them as one of best managed completions companies with which I've dealt.",

Frack Tech (Green machines) was a big operator in the Barnett Shale in North Texas and now seem to have disappeared.   There is little activity in the Barnett now days for Fracking.  I guess it has all moved off to the Permian Basin.  But yet, there are still Frack rigs parked not being used.",
"Through numerous ad hoc purchases I found myself over-weight in pure fracking companies and related services. However I saw that, in general, while production was rocketing and prices relatively high, free cash flow for most was/is still negative - the required CAPEX was/is eating any production gains. Also I saw:- heavy dilution;- excessive funds raised on the capital markets;- increased bank borrowings;- debt continually re-financed back.Even the obvious winners (service and sand companies) have not been doing well as investments- service companies presumably due to intense competition and sand companies - despite the significant increase in production - falling from $21 to $7, $36 to $11 (approx) etc. If the industry is like this when production and prices are high, what will happen if there is a fall in either variable? In the past month, admittedly both service and sand companies in particular are generally increasing in value but this is after one year's dead money/huge capital losses. Anyway, the long and short is I have used recent price rises to cut back considerably on my pure fracking exposure and sleep better for it. Still with much O&G exposure, but not pure fracking.",
"The frackers are like the seismic data processors of old,  when times are good everyone who can spell ""frac"" jumps in to grab a shrinking slice, when things go south they all cut prices to survive andno one makes any real money for very long.  Better to find a solid niche to play.",

At one time they claimed to have more horsepower in the US than Schlumberger. Rumor has it they are considering an IPO.Profrac is another privately held frac company with a significant presence. It is owned by the Wilks brothers from Cisco, the original founders of FracTech.

"Would be very interested in your take on LBRT's ownership structure post IPO. They have a kind of complicated Class A and Class B share structure which appears to enable Riverstone to maintain control of LBRT without having to pay for the shares.LBRT itself is a holding company that owns 53% of an the operating company that actually has all the equipment and operations. Riverstone owns the other 47% of the operating company via ""LLC shares"". So the business is jointly owned by the two entities.Riverstone was granted one Class B share in LBRT for each unit they owned in the LLC. The Class B shares have equal voting rights (39% of the total shares) to the Class A share, but no economic rights. Riverstone also owns some Class A shares (10% of the total A+B shares). In total Riverstone has 49% of the voting rights in LBRT which will enable them to control financial decisions in LBRT, if I understand things correctly (not at all sure I do as it is complicated). So Riverstone controls LBRT without having to pay for the Class A shares. Further, they own 47% of the business via their LLC ownership of the underlying operating company.So the notion of a severe conflict of interest pops up at this point, at least for myself. What is the danger of Riverstone making financial decisions at the LBRT holding company that is advantageous to Riverstone but perhaps not in the best interests of the Class A shareholders?The LLC units representing Riverstone's 47% ownership of the underlying operating company  (eg not part of their LBRT holdings) can be converted into LBRT Class A shares. If they choose to do that Riverstone gets an additional payment of 85% of the ""tax savings"" that result from that conversion from LLC units to Class A shares. It was hard to parse that, but left me wondering if Riverstone has set up the ownership structure in such a way as to disadvantage public investors. If not, why have such a complicated and opaque ownership structure?It could all be a benign result of leveraging accounting and IRS rules. But it would sure be nice to get an unbiased analysis of all that.Thanks much.",

I sold my entire position today. Just seems the valuation is getting rich. Still like the business (and the beer/spiked seltzer).,
"This is a fantastic short.   Volume declines of 8% in 2016 and 5% estimated for 2017.  Material EPS decline over the last 2 years as well.  It would be even worse, if the company were not STUPIDLY buying back stock like a fiend...a reckless direct transfer from the pockets of the company, to the pockets of Koch and his departing CEO....who have been dumping the stock like crazy.   (Does anyone see what is wrong with this picture?)They have given a preliminary projection of low single digit volume growth for 2018, which probably means it will likely be a low single digit DECLINE (since their original projection for 2017 was -7 to +1, and it looks like it ended up at -5).Buying back stock like they are makes eps look not as bad as things actually are.   The whole thing stinks to high heaven to me.   It shouldn’t be at over 30x earnings.  It should be at 15-17x earnings.  And when earnings drop to $5.00-5.50 in 2018, and volumes continue to DROP, the Street will start to see past the cost cutting, and price increases, and know that you can’t keep growing gross margins by 100 basis points a year, when you are SHRINKING as a whole.The Street is treating this as a growth story still, which is absolutely asinine.   The low float, and sleazy buyback, is tending to keep the stock price high.  But unless there is a buyout, this thing is going to drop like a stone over the next 6-12 months.  $100-125 Target.   I’m not short yet, but I will put on a short position when the market bounces.   The game is OVER here, but it is still a “darling” for many.   Foolishly.   The music has clearly stopped to anyone with a pulse.Their only chance is that the new Sam ‘76 “takes off” in 2018.  But I wouldn’t hold my breath.The stock price is being artificially held up by the buyback.   But the buyback represents fiduciary recklessness!  (What arms length self respecting management would buy back stock, at 30x earnings, of a company that is decidedly SHRINKING?)",

Who drinks Sam Adams?,
"SAM is between a rock and a hard place.  The rock is the craft brewers.  People like local, big tastes, and endless choices.  Craft gives them that.  The big boys like AB, Miller and Coors are the hard place.  They have the scale, marketing and the pricing power.  SAM's non-beers are in my opinion, more faddish than their beers.  Beer is a constant, alternative drinks come and go.  If you are watching, watch for a short.  I shorted them successfully last year, but no position now.",
"There is a lot wrong with this article.  The biggest omission is that the majority of the growth at SAM has not been because of beer but rather Twisted Tea first and then Angry Orchard.  It has slowed because the Shandy product, the Hard Root beer and the other Malternatives SAM has tried of late have largely been flops.  As for the growth, volume depletion’s should continue to be flat to down. However SAM is a company that regularly pays a hefty Tax rate and will be helped is a huge way by the new tax law.  Money SP500 companies do not actually pay the full corporate rate and won’t be aided as much as many suspect, but SAM will so it has a nice EPS jump ahead.   Once the price adjustment after the 2018 guide is in I suspect it will be safe to be short again but not until.",

My concern with EA is they are burning through IPs at a really fast rate. Breaking into the video game world with new IP is very difficult and always a gamble. They have very strong sports titles which will soften the blow a lot and give them a good back up. But with 2018 having no recurring IP and only a handful of releases i think it will be hard to keep the momentum going.,

"All of this is assuming EA learned from their mistake with BF2 however. They were caught lying to their consumers about why they had mtx in the first place, when it got out that they told theit investors that removing it wouldn't affect the bottom line.This wasn't a case of them simply saying something slightly wrong; they deliberately tried to mislead consumers by claiming mtx was required in their games because otherwise they wouldn't make a profit (""too expensive to make"").Despite their numbers being good recently, in the gaming community, EA is regarded as one of the worst companies in the industry; a company which buys good brands and deliberately guts them, to then close them down. And after Mass Effect Andromeda and the closing of Visceral, the attitudes toward the company remain largely negative.I would not call EA excellent. Profitable, yes, but as a corporation that cannot avoid PR disasters and has to rely largely on the uninformed general public for revenue and pandering to minors with paid loot boxes (gambling in every colloquial sense of the word), they hardly make for excellent. Truly, so many other companies are doing this, EA simply became the means by which players could release their rage over this developing trend against MTX and loot boxes.And that EA is so out of touch with the community that they fail to see that (they did say the backlash essentially meant less than nothing to them and that they would continue as normal), is frankly concerning.If EA does not realize that players are becoming more informed and harder to prey upon, then they will be among many companies that will experience a rude awakening further down the line.It may look good for now, but there is no precedent for the level of scrutiny games in 2018 are going to be under. And EA is guaranteed not the only publisher that's going to feel the hurt when all of these repressed feelings of animosity end up being released in full. Gamers have realized that they can be heard. Mainstream media has learned about things that happen in the gaming industry and are paying extra attention. All game publishers today will need to tread very carefully, because they have (at last) stepped into a minefield they should have entered years ago.And I, for one, am anxiously awaiting the day when gamers unleash hell. That will be the day the industry I love most in the world is going to crash, and I truly and sincerely hope it won't have to come to that. But as it currently stands, many of us believe that an industry crash will be the only way to save video games.And we truly do believe that out of our love for the industry.",

Berkowitz is dumping SRGBigly,
Berkowitz sold his bank holdings right before they turned around and he put the money from those sales into Sears stock which immediately plummeted. A few years ago he sold most of his Berkshire Hathaway stock to gamble in nearly worthless Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock. If Berkowitz is big on JOE then I am looking for opportunities to profit from a JOE stock price collapse. Doing the opposite of Bruce Berkowitz has been highly profitable since 2012.,
"Everything is rallying right now, so I wouldn't recommend a short, but definitely not a buy for the following reasons.  1.

This company has long ago sold off its best water front real estate.  Most of what they have is now backwoods.3. This company has been hyped for decades, mostly for all the land they own.  Meanwhile the land they own has been mostly sold off.4.  Did someone say they own Sears and JCP bonds?  Hoo boy.  Most of their profit right now is from their subprime bonds.  That won't last and will probably backfire.  Very risky.",

Since then Joe has missed a major home building boom and has probably missed several hundred million dollars of lot and home sales.

more then 50% of Bruce Berkowitz portfolio is Joe. This is a statement!,

I remember JOE at $85/ share. Glad I sold it at $72 at a loss and never touched it again. If you are right I will take another look again but only if the balance sheet is solid.,
"I live in the Florida panhandle. Very familiar with JOE and their properties but must admit I consider it a dead money stock. Maybe the changes author mentions will be sustaining..... I made good money years ago during land craze and hay days when JOE was a 3x-4x bagger, if I recall they owned close to 1 million acres back then so they have sold off a lot of land in last 10 years. I can assure you a lot of their scrub pine sand land (miles inland) is not worth the $5000/acre average you mention. I play a local golf course in JOE residential community and it is going down hill in shape, turned over to cheap management company. I used to play Camp Creek near coast, and willing to pay high fees but they closed it to public, kind of the opposite of an income producing property. Very little play and I am sure a money loser. It has taken 10+ years for property values to remotely recover and so many people lost their shirts buying into the great JOE coastal property theme. Perhaps one day they will benefit if still holding (or unable to sell).

I think the writer has hit it right on the nail! What he says makes a lot of sense.,
"I would have the same issue with a pure EV GM pickup as I would with a Tesla...you need a lot of battery power to move a big vehicle, and you need a lot of power to do the things pickups are made to do. Hauling and towing are going to sap power very quickly, plus the vehicle is going to weigh a lot more than an ICE, I believe. How does this make any sense at all?? Unless batteries get exponentially better--more efficient and lighter--I can't see an electric pickup making sense",
"This is what I said all along! It's a case of ""whatever you can do I can do better."" Tesla develops the market and maybe even makes a few good cars and a few bucks.

Each small element had to be taken off and redone expensively and in the end according to Elon it was like - remodeling your home but only one wall stood as original.So the model S was designed from scratch as an electric vehicle and that is the point I made about learning from roadster 1(or roadster 0?).To rub some salt in, Elon was it's designer and got global awards for it.

GM has the advantage. All it needs to do is replace the gasoline engine with the hybrid technology or all-electric motor and find room for batteries. Of course it sounds easy but is more complex. GM is changing models so often that this will just be a project for them.,
"Here is why Tesla will be a disappointment for new investors. Those who got in early will happy to sell.1) No US auto company has seen a bankruptcy free or near bankruptcy free operation2) Every major auto company has an electric car3) The Chinese will soon have an electric car4) Every major auto company will install the electric technology in cars, trucks vans5) Electric motors/generators are very reliable and have been around for a long time. Once the peripheral controls are designed, everything on wheels from the same company can have the same design with changes to battery capacity (easy to add on even after market), different size motor/generator depending on power needed. Therefore heavy competition especially if the peripheral controls are sold by companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft and Intel; who are all playing with the idea of being part of the auto business.I expect Tesla stock that has taken into account future sales to peak in the next 5 years, after which investors will benefit from timing their purchase and from dividends similar to all mature car companies.The wild cards are going to be China and India and other emerging markets. Here is why:1) An unemployed workforce that even in China is getting restless in regions like Tibet and Xinxiang in China controlled by supplanting its population and army for too long. And the young in India are already rebelling by punishing the best government they have had in a log time and the alternate is a known corrupt government that foreign governments with money to bribe will love.2) The car controls and multimedia technology will be the same from one car to another car or truck no matter the size and so it will come down to assembly plants and trained laborI think in a couple of years, Tesla will loose its advantage and then it will be a pure manufacturing play and hopefully it will return its investments @ 10% per annum.",
"the Bolt EV isnt and will never be competition for the model 3 and isnt responsible for doing anything to the model 3 margins.   tesla is competing against itself in this ""race"".  however, it is a valid point that in the truck area, GM might be able to leverage brand equity with truck buyers and even if they launch at the same time, be able to win that battle.  but consider that even if GM wins that battle, they are only protecting market share that they would inevitably lose in the truck market.  so they trade out lost sales for gained sales of truck EVs.",
"Tesla has problem making cars, it will have problem making pick-ups and semis.GM and Ford know how to make cars and pick-ups, all they have to do is put batteries in their cars and trucks.",
"One problem is the current market for pickup buyers is not green-centric and an all electric pickup, or even PiHV/EREV may miss the mark.  Fleet buyers may go in on purchases if there are the rich incentives for municipalities - such as the $15,000 per unit incentive I am aware of in my area.  GM and Ford can transition the consumer mindset to the torque possibilities of EV trucks and this can be a good thing.  However, this will take time.  Men or should I say ""real men"" like the vroom vroom sounds of trucks they learned when playing cars with other friends, as kids.  They have a hard time realizing that electric torque will be a fantastic thing for them in trucking situations of off-road surfaces, ice/snow, towing, lugging, pulling trailers, boat launching and more.  If it doesn't go ""vroom vroom"", I doubt ""real men"" will buy it, especially if a plug in costs $15k more.Next few years certainly will be interesting.  For the niche players like Bollinger, Elio and the others - I worry they will just get washed away by the big players.  Who knows what Tesla gets into - other than more debt.",

Heard it on Bloomberg radio that Tesla announces delivery delay for Model 3.  I wonder how much false promises can those who made the deposit take?,
"I think if GM chooses to build some sort of electric truck the sole reason will be because they choose to do so.  At this time GM and others are providing millions of affordable and reliable cars that people want to buy.  As I recall the Corvette sells out each year.  99% of all American new car buyers choose ICE’s, PHEV’s or Hybrids.  Why?  Perhaps American car buyers do not want to trade their GM, Ford or Toyota for a new BEV that is less convenient … has less range … and costs more.  No BEV can match the overall capability of a comparable modern ICE.  No BEV can presently be called an “all-purpose car,” that is, able to commute or go long distances equally well.   Electric motors are without a doubt, the best way to power cars and trucks.  Unfortunately batteries currently get in the way … and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  The short and highly variable range of batteries with long recharge times and limited infrastructure (412 supercharger “stations” in the US) means on long trips, a BEV takes over.  One must plan carefully and even then, the car calls the shots … how far … when to stop … where to stop … how long?  Sometimes the computer insists one take a circuitous route or backtrack to find adequate charging.  When driving cross country, some videos show BEV drivers turning off the heat/AC to conserve energy.  A few chose to avoid using the radio and USB charger.  As a result, it is evident, among car buyers, that BEV interest is not expanding like “wildfire.”  It has remained about the same since 2012 … about 1%.  I hope no one tries to argue that.  Some chemists have written their opinion that Li-Ion is hitting a ceiling.  At some point EV’s will become mainstream all-purpose cars … but not yet.  So why would GM or anyone else choose to copy a company that has never produced an annual cash flow?  And in Tesla’s case, American market share of less than ½ of 1%?  Regardless of the negative fanboy comments, GM teamed with LG Chem to produce a car that won a car of the year award … has been thoroughly examined by independent journalists and is well regarded … actually the most reliable car in GM’s stable.  When commuting into and out of New York City with ease I doubt Bolt owners could care less about foreign content.  It was, in fact, a shrewd business move by GM.  How are they any different from Apple?  My iPhone says “Manufactured in China.  Designed in California.”  Who cares!!  My iphone does exactly what it should and reliably.  Same for the Bolt.   I think GM could care less about Tesla who is struggling to survive and holds a miniscule market share.  ½ of 1%?   If/when battery limitations are solved I have no doubt they will flex their massive corporate strength and begin building waves of new BEV’s.  What about competing with Tesla?  Based on fanboy comments over the years and the purported $400K reservations for a car most have not sat in or driven, I think most fanboy’s have already decided only a Tesla will do.  During the exciting period between 2007~2011 Tesla began to gain traction and a bunch of EV startups surfaced.  Many commenters wrote that BEV’s would “save the planet” via the transportation sector.  Now the Bolt is online, capable and available.  But the fanboy’s say it’s not pretty enough and it can’t drag race Ferrari’s and Hellcats.  What happened to the earth narrative?  Again, for some, only a Tesla will do. BEV numbers are not that great and if Tesla advocates have already made their decision why should GM and others even bother to attempt selling these folks an EV?Finally, between subsidies and fuel economy mandates, the government and Tesla are doing their best to force EV’s on people.  But so far, they have not been able to force people to actually buy EV’s.  Should the US government be promoting and subsidizing BEV’s?  So far, it isn’t working.  America’s energy and transportation future should be left to the free market.  When battery limitations are solved and mass marketing of BEV’s makes economic sense, major car companies will build them and people will buy them.  Any other option involving government interference generally leads to corruption and waste.",

"It makes good sense that GM would not announce the EV/hybrid options now.  They will get plenty of attention from the basic Silverado announcement for now, and the additional drive options will give them a marketing boost as they get closer to introduction. Also, they probably don';t want to commit production schedules for the other options yet, and don't want to Osborne the basic Silverado by announcing things they can't deliver until 2020.Also, please note that none of this has anything to do with Tesla.  It is all about the F150.  Anything Tesla would do would be a gnat's eyelash.Let's get real about pick-ups.

Doesn’t matter; neither will sell enough to break even.,

This is why Tesla is going to be successful.  http://abcn.ws/2rbR1me,
"“Battery experts said the full cost of a GM battery pack, such as the one used now in the Bolt EV, is $10,000-$12,000, or nearly one-third of the car’s $36,000 [$37,500 last time we checked –Electrek] sticker price. By 2021, however, that price could drop to $6,000, according to consultant Jon Bereisa, a former GM engineering director who helped develop the Chevrolet Volt hybrid”“Could drop to $6000.”So “hopium” is an element that can only be used by GM or Ford. Apparently Tesla and the Gigafactory have no “hopium” so they are unable to compete with GM or Ford.  So believe in “hopium” and sprinkle it on the Chevy Bolt and convince yourself that it is a sign that GM is about to dominate in electric vehicles.What do they think Musk is close to achieving at the Gigafactory?   It’s a highly automated production line to create battery packs from the batteries supplied by Panasonic.   I’d bet that Tesla is far closer to $100/kWh for a battery pack than GM or Ford.   I’d guess they are at $140-$130/kWh now.",
"I think an EV pickup truck would need a dedicated chassis. If a Model S needs a 100kWh battery to go over 300 miles, a truck (shaped like a slippery brick) would need a 150kWh battery at least and it would be heavy and massive - and cost way too much. If you're looking for six power trains I would assume two smaller convention motors smaller than 5.3L, maybe the 4.3 V6 and something even smaller and perhaps with a turbo. The 6th powertrain could be a hybrid and that would make more sense.",

As the Semi announcement detailed, Tesla would likely use the same motors and batteries for a pickup that it mass produces for Model 3.I’m long both GM and Tesla and don’t see this as an important conflict since there’s room in a transforming market for both.A BEV pickup/van that’s autonomous would rapidly take over the commercial market.

Do you or anyone else have a handle on Vale management? Obviously very difficult to assess, but do they appear to be there for self-enrichment or to create genuine value? Or to put it more objectively, any idea how many corruption probes they been subject to in the past 5 years?",

"Leo, for a young man you have investment wisdom beyond your years.  What a great education you must have had growing up speaking 3 languages and explaining things so well in English.  I buy into your macro view and like the forward looking growth indicator of the manufacturing PMI.  The USD index is wallowing at 3 year lows and that certainly supports higher commodity prices while easing any USD denominated debt load.  My largest foreign holding is VALE and my second largest holding is Petrobras (PBR) probably the two largest companies in all of South America and both Brazilian.  I’m beginning to realize some nice profits in both companies partially due to a weaker dollar.  If the US gets an infrastructure bill passed in Congress this year it will certainly be another macro catalyst for the stock to go higher.  I use to travel to Brazil and met some pretty talented engineers.  I like the high iron content of Brazilian iron ore and I like the automation of their new S11D mining project that uses truckless mining. This technology coupled with premium ore will keep their profit margins high per ton of ore.  To determine where the stock price is within its 1st standard deviation price range, I download its price history (at least 20 years if I can get that) then take it into MS Excel to use its AVERAGE and STDEV functions.  I then subtract the STDEV value from average price which becomes the low range for the stock price then add the STDEV value to the average price for the upper bound of the price range.  For VALE’s price range I came up with an average price of $11.07 (using a 15.28 year history) with a low range of $3.83 and a high range of $18.32.  I try to buy a stock somewhere less than its average price.  There have been multiple opportunities to do this for all of the commodity stocks.  If VALE doubles from here, I’m just gonna smile.  Thanks Leo for your positive view.",

"Been following VALE since 2011, in and out but long now with $3.86 DCA. Early retirement beckons if $20 in 2018! Totally agree on the upside...less debt, lowest cost producer and highest quality. Certainly on the right path.",
Excellent article! Leo.Probably the best article i have yet read which bring economics to life. I have included you in my follows and will read up on your previous articles. I wish more people would explain economics concepts such as GDP in a clear fashion as this!Well done gain again.,
Great piece.,
Thanks for the article. Hope you are right. I was stuck in Vale for about 7 years until I just managed to exit at break-even recently at $11 after having averaged all the way down to $2 per share. That was a real bad experience. I agree with your thesis but don't have the nerves to venture again.,

is AVGO rated by value line for safety and financial strength?,
I sold this POS company as soon as I heard of their hostile takeover plans of QCOM.  They are as aggressive as they are desperate. There are so many other good tech choices.,
"The short sellers would be burnt eventually just like INTC today. This company offers 20+% revenue growth and 2.7% dividend yield. Can you find another one in the market? Definitely No!With or Without Qcom, AVGO is a great company with huge potential and the CEO is an aggressive, practical Asian - think about NVDA, AMD and TSM.Go short this baby, I cannot wait to collect calls and stocks!",
"So, now with AVGO dropping to almost a 10 month low, and dropping daily, what is a good price to pick some up? I never thought it would drop to under $250, but here it is. Maybe if Apple does not have a great quarter, AVGO could get to $210, then build back up into their earnings.",
"I think the price target of $310 is a bit on the low side.  Even if the takeover of Qualcomm fails.  I am betting on $300 by March and $340-$350 by EOY in this bull market.  Great company, management and future ahead.  I still hope the deal goes through for Qualcomm because the will move headquarters here from Singapore.",
"I am long AVGO and am ahead 75% in 18 months. Their forward PE is 13.50. S&P analysis report has a 12 month price target of $310 (about 17% above the current price). Dividend yield is 2.65%. At the moment, the one concern I have is their dividend payout ratio at 102.77%. I think they may have raised their dividend a little too much in 2017. QCOM doesn't compare. Their payout ratio is even higher than AVGO at 134.39%. QCOM does have a better dividend yield of 3.49%. Their forward PE is also higher but still not bad at 18.63. S&P research 12 month target price is $70 (about 7% above the current price). QCOM's stock price first reached $65 back in March of 2012, almost 6 years with no capital gain unless you timed it right a jumped in and out a few times.Both may be good companies, but it seems obvious to me that AVGO is better at creating shareholder value than QCOM. As an investor, that is what I am looking for. A successful takeover would be good for QCOM shareholders in my opinion.",
"AVGO is already overpriced, and their customer base is not growing.AVGO revenue relies on AAPL, and AAPL only. If one fine day, apple comes and says, we are going to use our own wi-fi. then AVGO will tank. This happened to many of the apple vendors, so there is a possibility, AVGO also will face the same problem.",
"Important note: There HAS TO BE A DEAL before you talk about the likelihood of that deal being ""approved"".  It's high school to mislead and talk in such an irresponsible manner.  We should expect more from an SA author.",

At the end I don't believe politic being the real reason. I believe FB's earlier attempt to work with media company and distribute media content would have been a failure causing lesser engagement between users. It's because not every article or news from media can be made-engaging. So to push media content via algorithm may not be as good a quality filter as simple friend's sharing. I use to work in the media industry and most of the articles and news we produced and pushed were NOT winner. Many of the journalists and writers were writing for their own cause and will come up with all kind of excuses for their articles not being well received. So for FB to go back to the basic of leveraging Friends to share articles was actually what I thought FB needed to do. Now that FB is back to the original strategy, it's good and I will long FB again.",
FB poised to skyrocket higher.,
"I already have FB and may add more.  The comments by Zuckerberg do reflect a ""business model"" risk with FB.  The stock is roughly at 20X forward looking cash flow and has been growing cash flow at over 50% per year.  That is both good and bad.  The good is obvious.  The bad is that the business model is not set in stone and could cause earnings growth to slow down if it becomes harder to monetize the newsfeed.  FB is an unprecedented company - I am not sure if any company has seen the combination of earnings growth magnitude and rate in corporate history.  FB could eclipse Apple and Google in the future.  But this is not a zero-risk growth runway and one must be able to stomach some volatility.  WD",
I'm expecting FB to run back up to $190 with earnings 2 weeks away.,
"Hi Joe. Fully agree on your difficulty to understand how this algorithm reset (aim to improve end-user experience and content relevance) can possibly affect FB revenues but the opposite. Change is good, especially when aiming to improve quality and experience. Last Friday's reactions seem quite overreacted and obviously non-fact based.

"Baytex has lots of acreage in Alberta and Saskatchewan, it looks like they sold Slave Point, a light oil play which requires a breakeven cost between $45.00 to $50.00 US. What it’s worth and current production, don’t know. OBE sold their Slave Point asset for $148 million in a depressed oil price under $40.00 WTI to the same acquirer. Baytex is focusing on Lloydsminster, some of their production here is bitumen which fetches a higher price to heavy oil, it pays much less in royalties and transportation costs are lower because of close proximity to pipelines, they also have acreage in the Cardium with rights to 6 or 7 formations, this asset is currently producing with infrastructure they own. I think at some point they will probably sell EF paydown a good portion of their longterm debt which isn’t due until 2021 and focus on the assets they can control which they don’t have control over in EF. I don’t own this stock but find it interesting with higher oil prices. I think they will be ok. Here is some info from BTE annual information form,Conventional Business UnitThe Conventional Business Unit produces light oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from various fields in northern, southeast and central Alberta. This production accounted for approximately 12% of total Baytex production in 2016. During 2016, production from this business unit averaged 8,419 boe/d which was comprised of 2,675 bbl/d of light oil and NGL and 34,453 Mcf/d of natural gas. At year-end 2016, we had 139,313 net acres of undeveloped land in this business unit.The following is a brief description of the principal property within the Conventional Business Unit:Pembina, Alberta: Baytex acquired its initial position in Pembina in 2007 and further expanded its presence in the area through the acquisition of Burmis Energy Inc. in 2008. Production is primarily from the Cretaceous and Jurassic age formations, including the Cardium, Notikewin, Falher, Ellerslie, Glauconite, Rock Creek and Nordegg. Baytex's oil production in this area is treated at third party-operated oil batteries. Natural gas production is delivered to a combination of four mid-stream gas processing facilities and two producer-operated gas processing facilities. Baytex owns a working interest in one of the midstream-operated gas processing facilities. Production from this area during 2016 averaged 1,367 bbl/d of light oil and NGL and 26,799 Mcf/d of natural gas (5,834 boe/d). Baytex participated in the drilling of one (1.0 net) well in this area in 2016, resulting in one (1.0 net) natural gas well. This well was completed with multi- stage fracture stimulations. At year-end 2016, Baytex had 29,187 net undeveloped acres in this area.",

"Here is a nice statement about Crispr technology in CarT as well. “One application for genome editing is the deletion of genes that can dampen T cells’ ability to fight tumors—a possibility being explored as part of the first US trial to test CRISPR’s potential in humans, scheduled for early 2017. Designed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, the trial will include disrupting a gene coding the immune checkpoint protein PD-1, a T-cell surface receptor that tumors often exploit to dampen T-cell activity. While the protein can be targeted with inhibitors in the clinic, knocking it out genetically could increase the persistence of T-cell activity—though the approach deserves caution, notes Dudek. “Knocking out PD-1 might seem like a great idea, but you’re taking the brakes off a very powerful locomotive, so you’d better be able to stop it if something goes wrong.”",

"Thanks for linking to my article. While the operations might be 'improving' I believe your thesis still has the same holes that I pointed out. It also features one large omission which invalidates some of your claims. Apart from showing comparable M&A, you have not mentioned anything that would suggest that anyone has interest in LFGR's assets. You provide an okay overview of the products to support the point that someone would want to buy the platforms but you fail to mention why are they unique.In my original article, I point out that both Society6 and Saatchi are similar to other players and do not work as your usual marketplace business model (which is visible in the profitability or rather lack thereof). The same applies to the website portfolio which is hardly in turnaround mode, more like a 'stabilization' mode at best. Moreover, the profitability is unlikely to be accurate portrayal due to possible incentive to hoard corporate expenses in order to make it look like the websites are profitable. I also believe you commit a serious misrepresentation. You mention;'When looking at the marketplace business as a whole, you can see that it's full steam ahead: in the most recent quarter, transactions are up 35% y/y, average GMV per transaction is up, and even social media followers are up - all signs of a healthy business that's catching on with the in-crowd.'You fail to acknowledge that most of the growth is coming from the acquisition of Deny Designs as discussed by the company itself in its SEC filings (however it is peculiar that the company does not break it down further).

The number of transactions increased 35% to 380,766 in the three months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to 282,960 in the same period in 2016, primarily due to the acquisition of Deny Designs, new product introductions and increased conversion rates. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, Marketplaces average revenue per transaction, which excludes certain revenue or transactions generated by The Other Art Fair that relate to the hosting of the art fairs, was $58.85, remaining relatively flat as compared to $58.56 in the prior year period. The increase in Marketplaces revenue was also driven by the acquisition of Deny Designs.'This omission then completely invalidates some of your claims and I suggest you rewrite the article to account for this.",Leaf Group: There's Something Compelling About This Small-Cap Name
Interesting piece I saw on the news recently.  A restaurant (don't remember where) figured out it's speedier to take credit or debit cards and turned their establishment into cashless.,

FY2018 EBITDA is now expected to be half of the author's estimate. Something went obviously wrong with the risk/reward ratio.,
"Meet is a guess waiting for an answer, as advertisers pay good money for adds when the necessary user metrics are in place and user base is at least over 10 million. Now that Meet has a user base of roughly 15 million.  If they don't provide sufficiently improved guidance for add revenue and EPS for 2018, I am trading out of the stock, it has been one of my worst underperforming stocks and simply won't wait any longer for them to get it together.",
"Two serious flaws to this report which makes it clear it is written by an amateur:1) The author talks about ""the high growth rates seen in revenue"" and to expect 25% revenue growth going forward. Might be worth noting that the recent revenue growth has come entirely from acquisitions and not organically. Pretty important little detail! Without additional acquisitions, similar revenue growth is highly unlikely. Even then, with acquisitions, that revenue growth comes at great cost.2) Author also failed to note that while MEET gets 70-75% of their revenue from advertising, this is a serious issue as ad rates have been falling 25-30% YoY. This is the key reason why the stock has been killed and nothing else. Now that said, management seems to be making the right moves in trying to diversify its revenue base towards subscription or credits from video, and away from advertising. Video is the most interesting piece to this story, yet it was somehow never mentioned. Without knowing if or when the trend of declining ad rates (75% of their revenue) will reverse it is hard to be bullish on MEET.",
You never explained your risk:reward ratio you put in the summary. What did you mean by that?,
"There's a reason for the discounted valuation as The Meet Group is more or less a roll-up of once hip social networks that have eclipsed their zenith long ago. While the company has (mostly) done a good job to squeeze out some EBITDA from these residual assets, the business model, clearly, looks unimpressive, to say the least as the company needs to pick up more of these past-due businesses to suggest growth to investors.As evidenced by the latest acquisition, LOVOO, revenues of the company's common acquisition targets have already peaked years ago.Lastly, the author should have probably waited for the Q4 report as the acquisition of LOVOO didn't close until October, 19. The full year results will actually show a large amount of debt (up to $80 million if credit facilities will be fully drawn) which should have been taken into account in the author's EV calculations.",
"Picked this up after the last crash, 3rd  quarter. What a bargain, got hammered because guidance wasn't up to par. That was corrected about a month ago, higher revenue than previously know.

"Thought I'd post a note from RBC on the rumored QRVO design win at AAPL and how it might impact AVGO.""ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW: We think it's important to have context on QRVO's potential mid/high band win at AAPL. 1) We think any such win is likely on a low-end LCD model (larger SE2?) and not on flagship AAPL products, which AVGO tends to dominate, 2) Volumes: We think it's important to realize that low-end AAPL models (like SE) tend to have limited volume products, 3) AVGO still has Year-3 of their 3-year contract with AAPL that provides them with content growth visibility through the fall-2018 launches. 4) low-cost SKUs tend to have lower ASPs and margins. We estimate AVGO's RF content in iPhone 8 is ~$11-13/device, in contrast, we believe ASP could be ~30% lower in a low-cost version iPhone. And 5) Performance Discrepancy: We continue to believe AVGO's FBAR represents the best in class filter technology, and is ahead of QRVO's BAW product in terms of performance. Net/Net: We are sticking with our TP rating and $325 target on AVGO given their ability to sustain double digit growth with our without QCOM.AVGO/QCOM Dynamics: The big positive for AVGO is they have a track record and credulity on their side, when it comes to convincing QCOM shareholders they can extract more value from the asset. Nonetheless, the onus is on AVGO to convince QCOM shareholders to look past the regulatory issues and support them in their proxy battle or go down our preferred scenario – convince QCOM board & management to discuss a possible transaction. We think this would entail among other factors – 1) An uptick in their $70 bid (we think $80+ could occur), 2) Commit to a large break-up fee (even if the deal is struck down by regulators) and 3) roadmap on how they can reformulate the QTL business going forward.""Big run up for QRVO on the news, surprised this hasn't hit SWKS as its further validation that SWKS can't win sockets at AAPL due to weak RF filter technology.Design wins announced now mean production shipments in April for May phone production into Dads/Grads season.

"scotch64, I'm just not a SWIR fan. They nibble on the edges of wireless - M2M, industrial, blah blah blah - as an integrator. Sure, they supply QCOM - in QCOM's niche trucking and industrial segments.And when BRCM closes on the QCOM acquisition - and they will - Hock Tan isn't going to keep the QCOM trucking and industrial bits.  He'll sell them off to someone in China.SWIR lives in the formative stages of a new wireless market - where OEMs need solutions, not technology. As the market grows, OEMs create their own solutions and they need technology/components/... That's when SWIR is pushed out to the margins of the market - like 5G in trucks, cellular in Coke machines, etc.Look at the numbers - 35% GM, low single digit net income, bounce between profit and loss annually.  Just what you'd expect from a company that has to have a relatively large catalog of SKUs to satisfy its major customers with customized solutions. Lots of SKUs in a $600M revenue company means low manufacturing efficiency...which is why GM is 35%.IoT is not the panacea for SWIR.  SWIR likes to build modules for cellular with price points for niche segments with unusual requirements.  IoT doesn't support niche pricing, and it doesn't support customization.And then we look at the charts.  IPO in 2013 at 8 (yuk IPO price...), ran up to 50, has never been close since. Tried to break out of a year-long correction early this year and rolled over. Volume is anemic. That means no one with any real money wants it.  And no one with real money has wanted it since the IPO.  The company is a product R&D shop for its major customers who then abandon it when the volumes kick in.  It sells variations of those products into the niches of the wireless industry.SWIR bought Numerex because it knows the only play in IoT they can make is to do what they did in cellular - hardware + software integrated solution. But the OEMs in the larger segments of IoT - such as there are larger segments - are already moving to their own integrated solutions and setting up component/subsystem partners.  Which means SWIR's IoT solution will be aimed at the same niche guys in M2M and industrial that they always sell to.No growth story, just an attempt to replace cellular with IoT as they get run out of the cellular niches.  Meh.",

"Bankers are running with the story that SWKS is the leading candidate to acquire MSCC. MSCC CEO Jim Peterson has a 1M share restricted stock grant incentive that converts 100% at $70/share before 2021. The thinking is that Peterson is ready to retire, a trade sale at $70 or above triggers his incentive.MSCC would be an excellent acquisition for SWKS - a highly diversified product mix with GMs in the high 50s and little exposure to consumer electronics markets. Peterson manages MSCC like a portfolio of small companies, so an ops expert like SWKS could create some value through operations.MSCC is currently in the low 60s. It will likely take the balance of 2018 for MSCC to hit its target price for Peterson's comp package. Expect SWKS to run into solid competition for MSCC, so the price will likely be north of $70. After watching SWKS lose PMCS to MSCC a year or so ago, one would think SWKS wouldn't miss on a second chance...",

"Thoughtful article although as another poster said, I am not sure the competitive comparisons shown are relevant.A common refrain I have heard about Skyworks over the years is that it is not a technologically strong company, even though it spends close to 10% of revenues on R&D. However, it does have Apple as a major customer and more recently added Samsung and Huawei. While there is no guarantee that Skyworks will retain the business of these companies (that collectively control 85+% of the global smartphone market), would investors feel more comfortable if they did not count Apple, Samsung and Huawei as major customers?I believe this is a case of whether one believes the glass if half full or half empty.",
"SWKS is currently my largest single position, period, and I'm patiently holding from a $45 basis rather than trying to trade in and out based on the current dominant speculation that SWKS is nothing more than a market satellite of  AAPL.Depends on your time-scale, of course.  But as a long-term (now retired) techie I've learned a few lessons about how ""quickly"" alleged world-changing technologies actually arrive in force.  In about 2001  I was working for a company providing analytics and strategic planning in the mobile-phone space.  That was the year, I think. that the term LTE became part of the conversation -- we've mostly forgotten that it stood for ""LONG Term Evolution.""  Which was required;  only 12+ years later were we even starting to buy ""4G"" (the new more marketing-friendly term) mobile phones.  Now 5G is still at the early stages I recognize: still trying to fully define and imbed the relevant technical standards, still trying to figure out who will pay for the rollout (we consumers in some fashion, of course), and still not firm on rollout-date commitments.IoT, of course, is a much more diverse ""coming attractions"" meme, but its early successes are familiarly spotty, not terribly useful, and generally not conforming to widespread standards. But patience will be rewarded, and SWKS should be among the fundamental suppliers. Here's what convinces me to just put my SWKS shares in a mental lockbox called ""active surveillance."" The first pretax double of a long-term winner is interesting, but the third or fourth or fifth sequential pretax double can be life-changing for the holder.  At +129% I'm working on that second one now  (though I've learned not to be dazzled by counting my ""5X winnings"" this far in advance).  And I'm avoiding playing taxes on interim gains when they could be part of the potential compounding.I'm not just Mr. Retail Buy-and-Hold, and look forward to more-active trading as the VIX presumably rises from the dead one day.  Call SWKS my single significant exception.",
"In your table of P/E ratios, the choice of companies for the comparison to SWKS should have focused on Analog suppliers that compete in the same markets, and there are some obvious omissions. Moreover, the space that SWKS operates in has multiple competitors and is difficult to understand. As such, I did not see any mention of how SWKS formulates a product strategy to give them a competitive edge.You are absolutely correct in that a key weakness for SWKS is an overdependence on a small number of customers. IMHO, the QCOM fiasco with AAPL has lessened the appeal of all semiconductor stocks that are stuck in the same boat, and that includes good companies such as AVGO, CRUS, SWKS, etc.",

I think they are selling in droves to limit further downside; (overall, the deal will be good form common sit pertains to cash flow)2. Discount to Henry Hub pricing. Although the discount is shrinking there are worries it could expand throughout the summer. SWN has most of its production in the PA/WVU/Ohio region where there is over supply and not enough pipes to take to other markets - so they are rec. a discount to the HH price;3. Longer dated (summer) futures are still down and could mover further south if FEB/March weather normalizes.4.

"In case anyone is still reading this thread, note that CHK has less than $2.5B in secured debt which does not come due for a couple years out… the maturities were pushed out last year. The institutional bondholders are simultaneously shorting the stock as a hedge, so when the company sells ~$3B in assets as mentioned by management, it is most likely the scenario that the proceeds will be used to pay down the secured debt. Then all of these conspiracy theories about how the bondholders are trying to bankrupt the company will go away and the stock price will skyrocket.",

why are the CHK 1/19/19 calls so cheap? 3.00 call is only 1.37,
I hope company gets sold. Im tired of being part of this mess,
SWN should be put for sale - enough is enough,
"Spring, Texas – January 15, 2015... Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) priced its previously announced concurrent underwritten public offerings of 26,086,957 shares of its common stock at a price of $23.00 per share and 30,000,000 depositary shares, each of which represents a 1/20th interest in a share of Southwestern Energy’s 6.25% Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”), with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to a $50 liquidation preference per depositary share), at a price of $50 per depositary share on January 14, 2015. The offerings were upsized from the previously announced offerings of 20,260,000 shares of Southwestern Energy’s common stock and 26,000,000 depositary shares. The net combined proceeds to Southwestern Energy from the offerings are expected to be approximately $2.04 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by Southwestern Energy. So holders are only recouping 1/4 of initial investment with only 75 million shares added to float !!!! And saving coming $100 Million interest payments a year. Remeber the common was trading at 24 a share when these were issued. Common holders won huge on this and common is grossly undervalued on all metrics!!",
Thank you for the article. I have been buying SWN last few dsys. my last trade at $5.09. let's hope for a great year and beyond.,
So has the rally been postponed until next week?,
"While I enjoyed the write-up, best to avoid  making such profound declarations regarding an impending rally as you've now opened yourself up to a load of criticism even though in the end you will be proven correct as SWN and CHK will gradually trend upward which is more in-line with your Buy the Shakeout article.",

"SWN was one of the energy companies i sold out of and instead focused on energy ETF's,  companies like SLB and HAL and the larger majors like Exxon, etc.   That's how i came out ahead in the last large oil tumble - by buying cheap but buying quality companies that could withstand a major oil tumble and through diversification via ETF's.",

"The par value for the 1,750,000 Mandatory Convertible Preferred was $1000.  Swn received 1.75 billion in proceeds from that offering in 2015 when the common was trading around 24 per share. Conversion was a massive win and windfall for common holders with all those being converted for only 75 Million common shares.  Basically preferred holders only recovered 1/4 of there initial investment and the company saves over $100 Million per year on interest payments !!!!  Swn common is a steal at these levels no ifs and buts about it.",
I thought we want the polar vertex to weaken so that all the nice cold air can escape south and bring us colder weather?,
all I can say is Chesapeake rally to about $8 and something last winter so far hasn't done much this winter but I'll tell you this if we get another polar vortex for a couple weeks I guarantee you there's going to be some fireworks in these stocks and then natural gas too,
This is dirt effin cheap here  just saved 100 million plus in interest every year for converting preferred in 75 million common. Common holders win huge huge !!!!  Expect a retrace to 8 plus in coming weeks or days,
"SWN did not ""issue more shares"". It was a conversion of the preferred shares which paid a quarterly dividend. This was planned and has been known for years. The conversion saves SWN $100+ million annually in dividend payments (which offsets the conversion of 75 million common shares).SWN's new problem is the vultures who are currently circling (entire company is only worth $2.65b at the moment). If someone offered a 50% premium to buy them out ($10 per share), it would only cost around $8.3 billion. That includes assuming all debt and cash on hand. Meaning, someone could buy up to 45+ trillion cubic feet of NG and 4,200 locations for around $8.3 billion. SWN paid CHK $5.38b in 2014 for 413,000 acres alone. Now, the entire company is only worth $2.65b? Really? Do you know what 45 Tcfe of NG is worth even at $3? When those LNG terminals in Louisiana are fully operational in 2019, 33% of our annual NG will be shipped. The USA will be able to export 3 billion cubic feet per day. The WSJ has several articles about the Saudis and others looking to purchase NG and oil assets in the USA. Big oil is also on the hunt for NG assets. NG is the future as 33% of all US power plants are now powered by NG (oil, coal and nuclear plants continue to decline). They could even do it via a stock swap and keep their cash (along with pocketing SWN's $1b sitting in cash). Most long term SWN investors would take a loss on this type of deal as their price point is above $10. If the share price continues to decline into the 4's, you might actually see it. SWN needs to get their debt down, but they do not have the same problems as CHK ($3.2b revenue, $1b in cash, 800m credit line, CapEx investments is within cashflow, no major debt due until 2022, NG is hedged at $3, no more dividends, etc.). FYI - I don't ever advocate buying a company based on buyout potential (you might as well go to Vegas instead). My point is that SWN's price is substantially depressed based on the facts and I wouldn't be surprised if someone ultimately steals it.",
"I'm a fan of CHK here, added to my position, joe, your impulsive posts wasted a lot of my time reading through this. you better tell your clients how much time you wasted on posting bs. Or, better yet, tell your economics teacher how you're trying to prove a blogger wrong. Author, thanks for an insightful post!",
"Yep, good acreage; but too bad they are suffering nearly 40% title failure on their CHK acquisition.  $5Bn deal, market cap less than $2.5 Bn. AND still diluting shares... what should one do? Even the cheer leading of this analyst could not move the stock upward... New low perhaps?",
SWN is way way undervalued here with 3 billion net debt positive cash flow with 3 NG and no debt due til 2022.  1.6 Million acres in some best NG producing areas in the world.  Patience will be rewarded ladies and gents.,

"I have an incredible level of disdain for people who, for profit, imply that they have a level of knowledge, or even the slightest understanding of subjects that could cost someone a significant amount of money if the reader were accept at face value that the persons claims and reasoning were as they claimed. I hate to see people taken advantage of, and if I can save one person from losing their heard earned money by believing the author, my time was more than worth it",
"Dear readers,When someone posts something like this piece-devoid of any semblance of data or reason, and says “I see it going up this much” without any justification for how they arrived at that number, not only is it fairly worthless, but it’s potentially harmful, especially when he’s not forthcoming with the fact that he’s leading you to overleveraged, commodity dependent, distressed junk. The justification for buying a stock should never be, “I think oil will go up so this will go up”. That’s not a thesis, that’s a guess. Please don’t pay someone a subscription fee for their “guess”. There is exactly one mention of valuation in the entire article (not one valuation ratio for each name, one total) and he justified SWN based on its P/E. If you ever hear someone justify a cyclical stock based on P/E, run. Cyclicals have increased earnings at market peaks and their worst earnings at the trough of the business cycle (hence the name). Professional investors, and even the vast majority of amateur investors know this, so they control for cyclicality across the earnings cycle, and derive their valuations from there. This matters because since they keep the numerator steady in their valuations across the cycle, the earnings change yoy, and these stocks look cheap at market peaks, when earnings are highest, but experienced investors know not to expand the multiple, and they look most expensive at the trough, because again, investors understand the business cycle. No professional would ever justify a cyclical stock by a fixed P/E, not only because it’s misleading but many investors would surely call him on his blunder and credibility. They also don’t typically use P/E for highly capital intensive industries, because if looked at in a vacuum, different investment levels along with varying depreciation and amortization schedules skew the earnings. It also doesn’t control for leverage, as a company that took on debt in order to grow, would be expected to grow faster, but at the expense of the added risk and duration, which aren’t apparent via P/E. Anyone who has experience in say, the energy sector, would use EV/EBITDA to control for those issues.So the author referenced the low P/E ratio as evidence of apparent value, but since cyclical stocks look cheapest when they are actually at an earnings peak, and a capital intensive company, or company with high interest expense deductions, from a high degree of leverage, will render the earnings per share a useless number.  When someone uses misinformed and misleading ratios as their single data point in an article where they are recommending readers invest their own money in, not only do they prove themselves incompetent, but, especially when the author is encouraging readers, who can’t be expected to be able to spot those obvious signs of someone who has no clue what they’re talking about,  to pay a subscription fee for more potentially harmful recommendations, I’d say at the very least the author is unethical, but in encouraging readers to pay hard earned money, for recommendations that have zero basis in any concept of accounting, finance, or even common sense, you could go so far as to say he potentially is misleading investors and misrepresenting his service. I assume many new investors come to this site to learn some basic investing concepts, I’d hope that they learned those basics before ever paying money to or taking advice from, someone that doesn’t understand those same basics.",
To the author: Sir you mentioned you are not fan of option or leap options for SWN. I am curious why? Isnt buying a leap call the same as buying the stock itself? Puzzled.. thx,
"Tks great article.  Appreciate the tip on SWN.  Close to fully invested with limited cash right now, so I’ll play the $5/$7 March 16 trade.  SWN looks range bound til market sentiment shifts with a solid bottom in.  Biggest risk appears to be short-term risk with slight negative drift.  Based on current conditions lateral movement with some break to the upside looks more likely given their improving financials, triple bottom resistence, improving sentiment about O&G, cold weather so far this year and rising NG prices.  Also increasing take-away capacity and lower cost access to the NE market should bump sentiment in a positive direction. Anyone know if where they sell their gas pramarily (NE-US) and whether they’ve signed contracts for Rover?  ETP pipeline completion could help them going forward, though obviously not much for Q4 results.",

"I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE MONEY HERE. I purchased NBR, ETP, RRC, TOO AND SWN several weeks ago. AS a group of 5 , they have increased 12% in price. SWN  is the lone equity that has dropped slightly during this time period. I will up my 6k to 10k later this week or early next week assign as one of my R.E. escrow closes. Thanks for your post.",
There is an easier way for CHK to get out of  its debt than BK.  It is to sell some of its under utilized assets which is what the management is trying to do.,
"SWN is a safer bet but CHK has better quality NG assets. Its NE Macellus has the second lowest breakeven cost in US.  The power river is still in exploration stage and its value keeps going up.  Then,  you have the potential Upside in EF on unexplored formations.  On the other hand,  the best valuable assets for SWN is the SW Macellus assets which was purchased from CHK in 2014.  It has some core of core acreage but not at the same level as its peers - EQT, Rice or RRC",

"I love the commentors that think I'm trolling. I'm not, I have no interest in what happens to CHK, in fact i think they are a phenomenal operator, but cap structure always wins.I am imparting, from experience, some things that might save you from a catastrophic loss someday. Maybe in CHK. People, and i find this especially with CHK investors, that they get emotional about the stock, and thats awhole other bias, but believe me, I'm not short, Ive never shorted a stock out of principle, I'm not a ""hater"" or ""basher"" . I'm a person who manages money for a living, and occasionally take a large enough stake in an E&P to get hands on. Other than that, I hate the upstream energy space. I avoid it like the plague. Most managers are incompetent if not downright shady, especially in the very small ones, and even bad managers can et a good reputation if the commodity price plays along, and even decent managers can go bust in a crash, if their acreage isnt good enough. So I have a unique perspective as an outsider that occcasionally gets involved. And i truly care that you guys dont get cleaned out. A lot of bad information gets around on this site, and its a difficult, time consuming venture to be consistently successful in the market, and even in the best of scenarios, many people arent equipped emotionally to manage their own money, so with the deck stacked against you, I at least dont like people to get bad advice.There are two scenarios here, one is that commodity prices rise, and CHK goes up, along witht he rest of the space, at least in the short term, which is better than the alternative, but if everything else is going up too, why own an overleveraged name? And the other scenario is that commodity prices dont sustain themselves, which accelerates their path to bk. And most importantly, remember, no matter what you think, THEY ARE INCENTED TO GO TO BANKRUPTCY. THE ONLY LOSER IS THE EQUITY HOLDER. The executive team, bod and the est of the insiders will get issued shares in the new entity, as well, and continuallyreceive bonus comp in the form of options, thedebt holders will be awarded the equity in the post bk version of the company, and the current equity holders will get nothing. If the company doesnt go to bankruptcy, it cant grow, because they are too impaired from a cash flow perspective and cant take on new debt. So they are dead weight, working really hard to stay alive for no reason, when they can go to zero and then have access to the debt markets again (if you thikn this works like a consumer where no one will lend to you after youve declared, you havent seen the incentive comp for a Goldman Sachs banker that places a debt round) . Theyll trot that debt out to everybody and their brother, take their fees, and have zero risk, because they dont want that garbage on their books. You can learn alot about how investments wiill play out just by looking at incentives.",

If I were going to by another oiler, it would probably be RDS.B, and possibly MPC on the refining side.

As long as investors understand these two choices are not even close to best of breed and offer nothing more than a levered play on natural gas but neither will ever perform because natural gas will not reach prices that would allow either of these worst of breed to profit enough to alter the dynamic of having too much leverage to overcome.,
"author, swn is indeed in a bottom information, a triple bottom of sorts, and has been sliding sideways for several months. I do think your trade will probably work because of rising oil and gas prices, but it would have been safer to wait for the stock to break out above the major resistance at 6.25, and above the 50-day and 200-day lines. I subscribe to the theory that having the best chances for success is better than getting the best price, and in general when a stock is near major resistance, I always wait to buy it until after it clears it. anyway, I hope your trade works out for you. Where is your sell point? 12?",

"Imho, Chk will go the way of SD. Swn, I think a much better managed company will do okay.",
I would be wary of CHK.  Bad reputation and it really is a trader's stock.  Not reliable enough for me to consider buying.  Natural gas on the other hand is on the rise due to the cold snaps.  We have had more and wider spread cold weather this year and the consumption of natural gas is higher both YoY and WoW.  Gas at Henry Hub shot up from less than three dollars per thousand to $6.68 last week.  That is good for the producer and maybe not so good for the distributor.,
"Well, the first two comments were worth reading.  I would add that the problem with the Natural gas market since 2008 has been deflation in that sector.  Deflation in well costs, finding costs, operation costs, servicing costs, etc.  The problem with CHK and SWN is that debt does not deflate.  Now, if you want to guess that 2018, is where this deflation ends or pauses, then CHK and SWN may get a bid.  This is also why you never want to see deflation in the broader economy as equity prices will always lead the way down in a deflationary economy with the debt laden companies leading the way down.",
GD you didn't mention how leveraged SWN is.   How much debt does the company have and when are its payments due ?,

Entry points are way easier than when to sell..we are so overdue a market correction that if that happens everything gets sold but as these are at or near all time lows seems a little less downsize to me.,

The game goes on.  Nobody knows anything about this industry.Loved it when Boone Pickens began his levered fund during the oil/gas boom.  Took about a month till it was down 98%.",
I like DVN better.,
I looked over SWN and decided to go with RRC instead. Hard to believe a major has not picked off any of these depressed nat gas companies.,
"Natgas for February was $3.14/mcf this morning (1/15/18); hardly worthy of a stock rally for producers.  Here in Marcellus, the treating and transportation costs are built into long-term contracts, and the producers will only get a very small net-back from this less-than-meteoric price increase.",

"Giovanni, I like you pick and agree that SWN is better than CHK mostly because SWN is a 90% nat gas play. I think WTI might drop if US producers start cutting into OPEC.If this cold continues as I think will, nat gas might even hit $4 and maybe $5 because I see February and March being much colder than normal. SWN should hit $7 quickly and then $8.Good article!",

Author-Thanks for the article.I disagree with your conclusion...imo the next 5 years will be AT LEAST as lucrative for FB as the last 5 years and most likely MORE LUCRATIVE..That is one of the definitions of the word Growth !,
"In a hungry market short term, this 5% dip gets bought back in a week. Then it ticks up into earnings around $190. They under promise and over deliver on earnings again for another boost on Feb 1.

why buy the dip...buy something else that will make you a profit not lose money,
"As a heavy, and highly addicted Facebook user and also an investor for over five years, I really like the personal news feeds, interest groups and the way I've set up my informational notifications for what interests me on a daily basis. Facebook for me personally is a fantastic product for getting great information all in one feed.  I love being bombarded with information that I want to see in my news feed. And as with my Spotify music experience, sure, a few ads thrown in is acceptable in exchange for a great product.  I also would like the experience of finding out what my friends and family are into on Facebook before I get to finance, world, national and local news on Facebook.  And the friends and family news isn't all that time consuming, but it still satisfies the curiosity, just not as a priority.    Over the past year, as sponsored ads and impertinent information has became increasingly obnoxious,  I realized that I would like to see personal, pertinent information first, because sponsored ads and news seemed to be crowding out the stuff relating to friends and family.   I am spending too much time with non-pertinent information-I want instant gratification and personalized information...period.  Facebook should make a change to make personal information a priority for users.  And, wouldn't it be nice if Facebook gave us a choice as to what our priority choice for information is, personal, news or business?  Renewed emphasis on personal customer experience is now necessary and smart.   So then last week, yes, I learned that it actually should happen- announcement, that they are going to make the change for a better user experience with Facebook.   Zuckerberg is absolutely correct.  Again, as a heavy user, great move Facebook!  This move, if correctly instituted, like other successful software changes at Facebook, will pay off big.  As an investor/user in Facebook, I bought the stock in the twenty dollar range.  Why?  I saw Facebook on par with other great tech companies, Google, Apple, Amazon.  And those companies, like Facebook, dominate their business niche and are well managed.  I learned a lot from the past because I because I missed out on the Google, Apple and Amazon investing opportunities.  With the Facebook investment, I was able to execute successfully early on because I kicked myself for missed great opportunities of the past and as user, I could relate to Facebook's well-managed success.  And, as we all know, this stock has done very well. Moreover, I continue to be reasonably confident that the good times to continue well into the future for users and investors of Facebook. I am enjoying the ride!!!",

RMP link---------------------Resonating with Ken on this: overload on  target attack. But on the other hand,  the good Dr. maybe talking about an isolated H2 system from prime source to H2.  Then numbers are correct.It is a very different matter to figure out an escape from the isolated case. IF CASIO & world body of generators are aware of the ungenerated electricity, that is also a fine information. But what will add credence to RMP position in a revised paper would be to demonstrate that these people , politics, money people will allow to have H2 generators soaking up extra generation- I would imagine colocation of H2 gens..one way.  Knowing all this, I  think it would require mighty force to overcome. Understood, Dr Bossell does not deal with this possibility at all.  The systems approach to suck in the extra energy to be stored in H2 is what RMP has to present to make this Article  totally immune to ad Hominem.----------------------...Now then, I would go about concocting mah own version of H2 gen!",

Imagine the magnitude of plastic   China is produing and the amount of hydrogen associated with this. This is only Chinese phase 1.  Their phase 2 will be getting hydrogen from solar and wind electrolysis.  There is no argument that China is the biggest renewable energy producer. Hydrogen will provide grid balancing and resiliency as renewable grows further. China phase 3 will be nuclear electrolysis, a longer time away.   China hydrogen source is clear.  This is all public information released by Chinese government.  Hydrogen equipment, storage and transport are a matter of investment only, not new technology here. Need a little time, yes, but China is getting helps from all over the world.  Since China plans to run FC in a few targeted demo cities with fleet operations now, it will not take long to build necessary infrastructure in Shanghai for example. Shanghai population is 25M, bigger than many countries in the world.  No doubt that this plan will be in place by 2020.  Who can afford not to participate this hydrogen opportunity in China?",

As China still lacks hydrogen infrastructure, it seems highly unlikely that the JV will produce stacks in an amount that would come even close to that guaranteed MEA revenues. So it remains to be seen if Ballard will indeed stuff the JV with MEAs it doesn't need and insist on the original contract terms.With 2018 doesn't exactly looking like a banner year for the company, the elevated valuation could indeed be challenged once investors realize the issues in China and the mostly non-existent revenue growth.",Ballard Power Systems Is On A Roll

Electric vehicle would be good for city driving but not for long distance, if you deviate for a side trip, you might have to be towed to get to a charging station. It is ok for Ford and others to experiment with EV vehicles, but do not put all your eggs in that basket. At least not on my lifetime, will EV vehicles will survive except with tax incentives or for rich people with status in mind. But for resale or as primary family vehicle, I do not see them.

For meaningful EVs, divide the number by 3 or 4 and now you have your answer as to why one vehicle launch costs $4.5 billion and sixteen cost $11 billion.3.  Are all these EVs going to fight for the piddling marketshare of the Bolt, the Leaf, and Tesla's vehicles?  Or, are they going to steal marketshare from Ford's other offerings?

Profits from Model X were then going to fund development and launch of Model 3.In other words, Musk technically provided the correct answer but without Stanford genius caliber pith:Organically.",

The author ignores the capital needs for exponential growth in particular capital needs for further gigafactories and also entering into new business areas.

"""Despite the bears' constant calls throughout Tesla's history for its bankruptcy, the company's cash balance has continued to grow, now at near-record levels:"""" Does that look like a company that is about to run into a ""cash crunch?""And where did the current cash balance come from? From internal cash sources or external? From page 14 in the link:"" Analysis of cash flows is the evaluation of how a company is obtaining and deploying its funds. This analysis provides insights into a company’s future financing implications. For example, a company that funds new projects from internally generated cash (profits) is likely to achieve better future performance than a company that either borrows heavily to finance its projects or, worse, borrows to meet current losses.""http://bit.ly/29d2SGNSpoiler alert: Tesla does not fund its operations, capex, nor pay back its obligations via internally generated cash. Since Tesla's operating cash flow is negative, that means that it also pays its obligations with sources of cash obtained from external sources, rather than internally generated sources.  In 2017, through 9 months, Tesla raised $5.8 billion in cash via equity and debt. Then it raised another $.692 billion from noncontrolling interests. That totals roughly $6.5 billion and all of it comes from external sources, and not generated internally.  It is from these source of funding that Tesla has been able to raise its cash balance by a measly $137 million this year. It is also from these sources that Tesla paid back debt and other obligations, made up the $570 million in negative operating cash flow to fund operations, and funded its capital expenditures. All from external sources of cash and zero amounts from internally generated sources of cash.  This is a red flag for a company at Tesla's life cycle stage. Failure to recognize this in this article is also a red flag that investors need to be cognizant of. I maintain that Tesla will not deliver (sell) more than 150,000 Model 3s this year and no more than 250,000 of all its models this year.  So far Tesla has not disappointed me.  Model 3 production is far behind schedule. Customer deposits have not grown materially in 2017 ($23 million through 9 months).  Any deposits for future vehicles should be placed in escrow, rather than used for funding Tesla's current operations.  I predict that Tesla will have negative operating cash flow again this year, 2018.  Inventory purchases will continue to grow, current liabilities ($4 billion at September 30, 2017) will need to be paid, interest expense continues to materially increase. (Another $2.5 to $3 billion coming from sales of Model S and X doesn't appear to me to be sufficient, either)If Tesla delivers (sells) 150,000 Model 3s in 2018, at an average sales price of $45,000 and gross margin of 15% (very liberal, IMO) that would be $6,750 per vehicle and $1 billion in total.  That's hardly sufficient to pay its maturing obligations, much less pay for inventory and interest expense. Cash is king, and Tesla has none of its own. Call me vewy, vewy skeptical.",

If Tesla truly were technologically so far ahead of the competition, the ability to raise large amounts of cash on the markets would be a significant factor!

In fact, it is falling behind. The troubles with the Model 3 production imply that it cannot really deploy the tech it has rapidly enough to compete on the BEV marketplace. That further implies that Tesla will never be able to compete on price, and mass-market BEV and PHEV vehicle sales will be dictated by price. Only price. Because that is reality - the sales of 50K sedans are very limited, always have been and will always continue to be. Tesla is going to lose market share among BEV makers over the next two years, rather than gain it, and it is dead in the water in the self-drive competition. In 2018 and 2019, the hype bubble surrounding Tesla will be exploded by the offerings of the other automakers. It's already beginning. Read the Tesla forums.

It seemed they where buying other brands of late which said they are trying to change and then this.. well new coke is in my memory bank and switching a product after years of consumer brand connection is imho a bad idea . Diet Coke the look the can the taste the flavor is a classic. Albeit I don’t drink it anymore but people who do would expect it to be there just as they left it. The effort by coke to color their cans and add new flavors to me is akin to a mid life crisis . Trying to be something you are not! Simply leave the Diet Coke as is heck fine change the sweetener type but let it be. Then start your very own line of new product but give it its own name don’t bastardize your first born to save yourself in the light of a powerhouse product like lacroix . By handling it in this fashion management has conceded defeat to $fizz and bowed to lacroix and now simply trying to emulate it and chase it . I wouldn’t be surprised if they repeat the errors of new coke and now we will soon see “classic diet” as a new brand . The word diet shouldn’t be used to fool consumers that they are drinking something that ok for them . It seems as a previous poster has mentioned it’s not just the ingredients it’s the approach and the word diet is passé . Either your consumer knows it’s a descent safe product or dare I say better for you product or they don’t. IMO coke will eventually realize it needs a wider effort in its revamp one that sets it up for decades and that involves rethinking all its products and the entire line offered. It also involves understanding the consumer isn’t totally oblivious to its marketing schemes. Big soda has conducted itself of late in a fashion that reminds me of big tobacco . Playing it’s games across the world peddling products to masses and spinning its story line to hook consumption. Time to be more transparent and straight and then the results will be stronger and sustainable .  I’m not long $ko  ur am long other healthy beverage CO’s when I see coke wake up I’ll jump in as it is a powerful player who once committed to healthy better products can make a huge impact imho .",
One huge advantage is less coloring needed for each can. That will save a lot of money in the long run.,
"The public is not in the mood for these kinds of marketing gimmicks and just how out of touch coke management is. The word ""diet"" is still there, a term from the 80's.

If I jumped ship (My daughter keeps my page up to date keeping me in the loop photos....)  a hundred others would have to follow to keep in the loop. Not likely as for each person jumps ship to stay in touch with me would require another hundred to follow them to the new mouse trap in order to stay in touch with them. Add that to fact unless they maintain two ""face books"" old and new they would loose contact with those in the old FB. Impossible as that would run into exponential numbers. Not to mention participation in FB in any meaningful way is so time consuming and complicated I won't do it. I'm a loner so not bothered, let the daughter do it.",

"I suppose FB has the pricing power to simply charge admins and advertisers more to compensate for the potential lost revenue. Also, an excess amount of advertisement does impact the user experience adversely, so a balance must be achieved between maximizing revenue and not losing DAUs.",
The site was turning into a cult. People staying within their cultural bubbles and creating hostility towards anyone who disagreed. I personally stopped using Facebook because it stopped being about connecting with friends and family. Instead became a platform for preaching political views and hate mongering.,
"The growth of a network is a function of a delicate balance between social engagement and the paid engagements. Perhaps the balance was tipping in favor of hurting the long term profitability of the company, then of course without the more personal and intimate metrix on user engagement on Facebook dashboard , the best that can be done is to speculate. It does not reduce the fact that Facebook is a great company in all aspects like it or hate it. The decision is certainly strategic and the reaction by the stock is not warranted !",
"Looks like the next few quarters could be misses vs current consensus; the street would have to lower estimates. Won’t rush to buy into this small correction yet.It looks like a small but fundamental change in the platform. While user base could still be growing nicely, investors have to bear in mind that not every DAU or MAU presents the same economics to FB. I suspect the seasoned FB user base (with much more data for FB to monetise) is rapidly detracting from the platform. While the new user growth somewhat offsets this (& possibly ‘fools’ marketers/publishers/a... in the short term), the ROIs for perf marketing would be lower and eventually show up to the parties paying ad dollars. FB needs to shore up the seasoned user base quickly before things get really ugly in financial terms. Also bear in mind that getting detracted users to return to a platform is always harder than clinching new ones.The press statements (& CEO messages) are just some nice ways to sugarcoat the structural weaknesses that are about to show up IMHO.",
"FB has really become boring.  I really started noticing over the last year that my friends don’t post much of interest anymore Friends don’t post much of interest , so when logging on, it’s a lot of advertisements.",
"I agree they must have picked up some kind of problem.  I've been noticing this for a while now and just moved the Facebook app to the second page on my phone so as not to get annoyed by the little red number only to find someone is posting an item matching a search I did in marketplace, or to tell me one of my pages could use advertising to get more likes.  Also lots more suggested pages and sponsored.  This junk is annoying.  Anecdotally - people seem to be posting less original content and sharing more things that are not actually relevant to their lives, just memes and pet videos or similar.",
"FB engagement has indeed changed.The definition of a friend has become singularly to broad. Not all Facebook friends are indeed friends.  Not all posts are appropriate for all friends.I find that people have migrated to closed groups for discussions and postings.  the groups have taken place of posting activity details and sharing thoughts.A big factor is perhaps that the groups are without advertising.  Fewer people share fewer personal details directly on personal feeds.  And lastly, the younger generation is more on Instagram than Facebook.  All combined, if neglected this could spiral downward and accelerate into a fall.  I suppose the great mind of FB saw the writing on the wall and took action",
"I was actually thinking of lightening up on FB due to their initial, boneheaded denial of having been unwittingly involved in the corruption of the 2016 election. I’m now back to Hold, as my fears of increased regulation have abated.",
I was a bit skeptical at first (if it aint broke...) but i think you did a good job in laying out the plan for long term investors like me. I say go for it.,
"I have noticed friends are posting less on FB and more on IG and the newsfeed was mostly articles and ads rather from updates from family and friends. If I felt it this way, am sure FB will see the metrics (reduced posts by existing users) and probably is getting a bit concerned but this is definitely a step in the right direction to retweak it and maintaining the platform for monetization. And a reason to charge more for ads (higher pricing power) if they manage to do so, since ads space will get more limited, key to watch the numbers and the feel in the coming weeks and months.",
"As someone who originally joined Facebook to connect with friends and loved ones, and now logs in and only sees ads for pizza, I’m highly excited about this initiative, both as a user and as an investor.I think the strategic shift, assuming it is legitimate and fruitful, will be a huge positive for Facebook in the long run.",
Seems to me that advertisers will have to cough out more to get those premium advertisement spots.,
of course it was right. now they can b/o twtr for $70 per share,
Great move by Facebook. Really admire a company to take decisions that are good for longer term rather than being bogged down by short term earnings estimate/analyst coverage.

Any one see how much oil has gone up the last couple of days?   I figure in prime numbers so I realize oil is just south of $66 but there are 31 days in some months.   Each $/barrel is about $12.5M/day at current production for COP.    That is a lot of money quickly.   At roughly $66/barrel is $825M/day.   That is roughly 2.5B/Mo and $303B/yr.   Go horse.   I know that I am fueling speculation but I would not be surprised to see COP hit 70 by end-of-Feb and maybe more.   Typical oil cycle ===boom-bust but long-term upwards for COP--30 yr holder.   Looks good on paper when I count my pennies for my grandkids.   I am just riding in the boat.,

"Interesting article Long Player!I am more positive on COP. I got out of COP in Dec 2014 at $69 and back in about $50 starting this summer. Like you I have had some reservations about management and valuation. Lets discuss some positives like cost, margin and taxes and look forward.- At $50 Oil COP is in line to have better Gross Margins in 2017 than they had in 2014 (44.77 ttm vs 44.13). The point is costs have dropped nearly as much as the price of Oil.- COP has paid about 50% tax by a recent report due to worldwide operations. The new tax bill has tax at 21% and an elimination of the Alt Min tax so it can drop further. Is 20% upside to earnings reasonable?- COP has given projections based on $50 Oil. With Brent exposure $65 is a good current estimate of pricing. I use $65 also because it should just about double expected cash flows from COP and its $50 estimate.- Reserves 8 bil boe at a cost of $35 or less should speak for itself.I wouldnt buy more shares at $60 but I am not rushing to sell. If you look forward COP has some great days ahead starting with 4Q EPS in a couple weeks. I am guessing the analyst high end estimates will be most accurate. If you look back into the crash COP looks expensive. As we sit today COP works at current Oil pricing. Especially given its Brent exposure, $500MM reduction in cost this quarter, expanding margins and discoveries.",

Seems a lot of these massive losses you're touting from prior years are merely non cash asset write downs due to the precipitous fall in oil prices.

"LongPlayers emphasis on sales of production, in my opinion, are too strong.  Those sales were, hopefully, carefully considered by management, and probably were not the most efficient in their view.

Long term holder (35 years):   Part of what is happening is a reaction to the stock falling too far.   I agree with the rest of the comments.  The production/share should be down because they are keeping their low-cost production assets.  Every $ oil goes up/down is an additional $12M/day.   That adds up pretty quick.  Also targeting debt is the right way to go provided you can keep the stock price up enough to keep someone from raiding you.,ConocoPhillips: Whoa Horse

"GBTC was referenced in the ""About"" subtitle of your article. The GBTC premium to NAV (yesterday's close was 63%, but it can vary) has been due to the false narrative that GBTC is the only available pure-play way of gaining exposure to bitcoin in an exchange-traded vehicle. In fact, there are alternatives in Europe that trade at a near-zero premium to NAV. These are available to U.S. investors who have, or open, accounts at a brokerage that can trade them. Just google “COINXBT”. Some details, including ISIN etc., for the ETN trading in Sweden can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/ybf... . And details for the sister ETN trading in Germany can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/y6u.... NAVs can be found here: https://xbtprovider.com .Generally both trade close to NAV (e.g., zero premium), in contrast to the 63% premium for GBTC. I have accounts at three brokerages. Fidelity allows trading of both the European ETNs. Schwab does not. Interactive Brokers does not (although it used to). I even placed a small order, which executed, at Fidelity (not more because I am already long a basket of crypto and don’t need more and would prefer futures over an ETN anyway).I also confirmed with Fidelity that both the Sweden-traded and the sister Stuttgart-traded ETNs can be held in IRAs. This last point is key. After bitcoin futures became available in the U.S. last month, GBTC ""premium apologists"" claimed that the GBTC premium was justified, as GBTC was the only way of getting pure bitcoin exposure into an IRA. That is not true.Details at Fidelity are as follows. Taxable accounts can execute online, the symbols are BITCOIN_XBT:SE (trading in Sweden, in krona) and BITCOIN_XBTE:SE (trading in Germany, in euro). For an IRA, the trade can only be placed with a human, not online, by calling their international desk at 800-544-2976, so the commission is higher than for online trades in a taxable account. I only checked with Fidelity, Schwab, and IB, so I don't know which other brokers, besides Fidelity, might offer trading in these ETNs. Perhaps if readers find others, the information could be added in comments below.Given that GBTC closed today for a premium of 63%, or about $646 per share, every share of GBTC sold at that premium and replaced with COINXBT can save the investor roughly $646 before commissions/fees. If you own, or have been considering, GBTC as a long, check with your broker…if yours doesn’t allow trading of COINXBT instead of GBTC, it might be worthwhile finding one who does…as long as the high GBTC premium persists, that is. We think the premium is likely to begin compressing quickly once this information is more widely known.DISCLOSURE: I/we are short shares of GBTC, and long a basket of cryptocurrencies.

"The author mentions being “long ARKW, GBTC”.  Anyone considering going long GBTC in order to gain bitcoin exposure should be aware that GBTC typically sells at a significant premium, often in the 50%+ area, to its true underlying net asset value (which is 0.09181239 bitcoin).  An easy place to check the current GBTC premium to net asset value is http://bit.ly/2qY7TwM (if the link doesn't work, try googling ""neotechdevs gbtc"". Also, it is only accurate during NY market hours; during non-market hours, I multiply 0.09181239 by the bitstamp.net price of bitcoin. As of Friday’s close, the premium was 54%; a buyer of a GBTC share paid $1970, but received exposure to only $1276 of bitcoin).In my view, the 54% or so premium that GBTC commands to underlying net asset value is destined to decline for 3 reasons:1.	In the near term, Grayscale, the sponsor, is now allowing accredited investors to purchase interests directly, AT ZERO PREMIUM to NAV http://bit.ly/2qURQ2I .  As this becomes more widely known, current GBTC owners can sell their shares in the open market at a still-hefty premium, and replace those shares with directly purchased interests at 0 premium.  Also, potential demand from “new investors” for open-market-purchased-... GBTC shares will be partially siphoned off by direct-from-the-sponsor purchases.  Both of these dynamics should pressure the premium.  BTW IRAs should be able to purchase direct from Grayscale also, as long as the IRA owner is an accredited investor.2.	Stock-exchange traded competition to GBTC is coming, including from Grayscale, the sponsor of GBTC.  Grayscale will imminently launch an exchange-traded Ethereum-equivalent to GBTC.  Eventually they will also launch a “basket” ETN.  Both of these will siphon off potential demand for GBTC, imperiling its 55% premium to true value.3.	GBTC “clones” could be launched as IPOs, which will create direct, stock-market-traded alternatives to GBTC, and contribute to a collapse in the premium.   A well-capitalized company could acquire bitcoin in the open market and then launch an IPO of a ETN trust clone of GBTC, at an initial discount to GBTC.  Importantly, the recent advent of bitcoin futures constitutes an enabler of this scenario, because the sponsoring firm could hedge its risk during the period of bitcoin accumulation, and until the actual date of the IPO.  4.	In the medium term, we will see bitcoin ETFs offered, likely based on futures (which only started trading a month ago).  As these ETFs will be pretty close substitutes for GBTC but can issue unlimited numbers of new shares, the GBTC premium is sure to collapse to near-0 at that point.  The first ETF to be approved might trade in Canada.So, we would avoid GBTC.  If you are a believer in bitcoin, gaining exposure through futures, or actual bitcoin, or direct purchases from Grayscale are much better choices than paying an absurd premium to NAV – a premium that is destined to decay toward 0.A comment on bitcoin in general.  A comparison is often made to gold.  But with gold, you don’t have people creating new, competing precious metals out of thin air.  With bitcoin, we’ve already seen OVER A THOUSAND competing cryptocurrencies created.  This is why bitcoin’s “market share” of cryptocurrencies has fallen from 100% to 33%...a share trend that we expect will continue. http://bit.ly/2qSDhei A MUST READ summation of some negative points re bitcoin: http://bit.ly/2FypPkKAlso, as far as the author being long ARKW, please be aware that ARKW has SHARPLY REDUCED its holdings of GBTC…from 6.7% of the portfolio at 12/31 to 1.96% at 1/12.

"I’m in disagreement with the last gentleman who is angry at your title. I think you are right on that 99% of investors are missing the crypto wave. I think you are also right on that investing in a basket of some of the more promising crypto will produce outsize returns in the next few years.  The Oracle of Omaha said he would buy a 5-year put option on the entire space if he could. I read that at saying that the crypto bull rally could last another 2-3 years. He is also saying that the vast majority of coins are garbage and that their value will be zero. A few winners will emerge from the space who will make Amazon’s return look quaint in comparison.My issue with your position is that I know that 90% of new crypto investors will get burnt. Some badly. All reading this and thinking about jumping into crypto owe it to themselves to thoroughly educate themselves and to also read an outsized number of articles that disagree with your feelings to avoid being in an echo-chamber.Yes, you are right that there is a good chance that just about any coin you invest in that has a good “idea” will climb. But how far?  For how long?  Most of these coins will fail (even if their value may climb at first) because there is no value proposition to owning them. Remember that a coin is not a share in the company. If the purpose of the coin is to act as internal “gas” to power whatever someone’s Blockchain is, you need to ask yourself why would somebody keep some of those coins?  Is there value in a future user for that company’s services to hold those coins instead of converting them to something else as soon as he/she gets them?  Ripple is a good example in my opinion. I love their business model and if I could buy their stock I would. But I don’t see the long term value proposition for their Ripple token. Why would banks hold hoards of Ripple’ token when they can quickly exchange dollars for XRP, use Ripple’s services to send money to a foreign bank and have that foreign bank quickly concern XRP to their local fiat?

Overall gross profitmargins were stable at 28% when compared with Q4 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses for Q42018 decreased by approximately $9,000, or 2%. The result was EBITDA up 18% in Q418 vs Q417. While wewere pleased with the improvement, we believe that the business has significant areas for improvement from agross margin and SG&A expense perspective.The company closed on the acquisition of BarberMate, a Barber brands business, late in the fourth quarter, sothere was little meaningful contribution in Q418.

The net increase of $637,000, or 7.7 %, was attributable to theinclusion of MD Barber Supply, which was acquired in September 2017, as well as moderate organic growth.Overall gross profit margins were virtually unchanged when compared with twelve months ended December 31,2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended increased by $271,000, or14.7%.

Hence OMI's credit rating is anticipated to move down to ""junk"" status with this acquisition. On the flip side, when I take a look at FAST Graphs, the companies AFFO looks like it is on an uptrend increasing by 90% in 2018 (still significantly below their 2015 numbers). I would be interested in the author's thoughts on why CAH might not be a better risk reward situation given that it has a stronger S&P debt rating (BBB+).",
"Thanks for the article William. I've been watching OMI for a few months, but am still on the sidelines.I tend to agree that long-term, if they can implement/integrate their acquisition plan correctly, there should be good upside in this stock and one will collect a nice divvy-to-boot, whilst you wait for the turnaround.However I have recently been burnt by a stock making a large acquisition and taking on the equivalent debt-load (TEVA). Of course one can't say the same will happen with OMI - but TEVA Management said similar things - acquisition was a good opportunity, plenty of synergies, etc. Trouble is, they over-promised/under delivered and Management appeared incapable of even initiating some of the promised benefits. Meanwhile, the stock tanked and the debt-load was now crushing. It was not until old Management were kicked out and new Management brought in, that the drastic job cuts and 'unlocking of synergies' that had been promised much earlier, really started to be implemented (and resulted in the ongoing recovery of the stock price). Long term, they should be fine - but I could've bought into the stock at ~50%, of what I did.Of course OMI/TEVA are 2 totally separate Co's, but it shows that there is a lot of execution risk with big acquisitions. This has made me hesitant to buy into OMI at this time, though my plan was to watch the next couple Q's and see how they fare. This may mean I miss the boat if OMI stock takes off and returns to the high $20's (I note you anticipate a good 4Q'17) - but then again, it may get cheaper? Who knows? There are a lot of unknowns between now and the approx. couple years it'll take, to make this Co. efficient again.Another point to note, is the gradually increasing interest rate environment. Though debt rates are still quite reasonable by historical levels, to borrow a lot now will cost you more than it would've, a couple years ago. You make a good point about the tax benefits with the new Law though - that should help their bottom line a fair bit.Thanks again for the write up.",

"Where do the above commentators get the information that health care and power’s products are behind the competition. Health care’s MRI’s  and cat scans are as good or better than the competition in such areas as resolution and output image clarity and power’s gas turbines are the best in the industry. Alstom’s coal driven steam generatiors are old technology. The great minds behind the acquisition bought market share and presence in markets where they were not strong. This and the idea that hybrid steam and gas systems would present a potential growth area were given in the purchase rationale. Probably not all it was thought to be. Further, GE’s attention to customer support and maintenance in health care is a problem and I suspect so has it been with Alstom, in the power business.",

Jan. 24 earnings report will give some insight.....but ....barring a tremendous drop in Oil pricesor some other large geo-political  event......The earnings report following the 2nd quarterof 18' will show if turnaround is happening. The Jan 24 report is too soon to show any significant healing.    In response to a commentator in a previous article: where he suggeststhere is too much rancor or harshness in comments....might be true..but wouldn't it bejust about the most fun to be able to go to a breakfast meeting with a collection of all theseinterested investors. I learn from all the guys who disagree with me.,
GE should be no higher than $15 for the pure reason that it needs to right the sinking ship.  Cutting the dividend in half should equate to the stock slashed in half.  GE could file Chapter 11 and negate its responsibilities to pensioners and shareholders and still be profitable to key employees and management just as GM did.,
Buying GE aggressively. The low volatility allows me to hedge the position cheaply by buying puts. I have protected the down side. A material move to the upside over the next 6-months should result in a material gain. The math and probability looks excellent at this point. No doubt GE is a turnaround story that has dramatically underperformed over the last year. IMO it’s worth allocating capital to the position as long as you have the appropriate time frame and understanding of the risks. Put buying is an excellent way to hedge a GE long position considering the low relative volatility. Just my two cents. Slow and steady. Good luck to all!!!,

GE is trending downhill what is making you believe that it’s turning around?,
"Unfortunately, Healthcare isn't the bright spot that many believe. Healthcare has lost its technology leadership position and has been chasing Siemens for several years now. Service is a joke because GE keeps slashing costs in service by hiring unskilled kids to service complex machines. Further, they continue to cut preventative maintenance and run their service guys like army mules. Worsening product field performance is the drive to cut costs by cheapening the parts that go into their radiology equipment. Will Predix turn that ship? Doubtful, since predictive analytics have been tried for several years in that business and it is a complete failure. My prediction? Nothing substantially good happens to GE Healthcare division until the mindset changes from relentless cost reduction to product revitalization.As to the benefit from partnership announcements? They're a whole lot cheaper and faster than fixing the real problems.",
"Since I cannot figure out where GE internals are headed, I will base my prediction on what appears to be the only factor that matters: sentiment. My reading of currently prevailing sentiment is that GE is shaky near-term (duh) but has upside longer-term. So, the stock will bounce around a bit for now, while the long-term price action will be upward. And that, friends, is my profound thought for the day on GE.

I asked the question when predix was put on the cloud. What is the business arrangement?  Is the idea that anyone can use it for a user fee? How will GE’s IofT software be tailored for an outside company’s equipment and what organization in GE will accomplish the task. Since I asked this question, GE’s new management has changed GE’s IofT focus to its own hardware. I tend to agree with this move, but how does it comport with your points?  I am also skeptical of any more selling off of non-core assets. I think this rationale has been way over used to justify the incompetence of management to run businesses which are highly competitive or have either rapidly changing market or technical dynamics. To sell major appliances, a business in which GE has both a large fielded base and very good name recognition at the same time as buying a windmill blade supplier in France to get net up in a low net business seems like convoluted reasoning.",

"Nice article and your opinion is valid. This is what makes markets.

That fact in itself is a huge advantage in terma of delivery and pick up. Last mile logistics advantage.Yes Amazon is the e commerce king. But WMT purchase of Jet.com was a game changer. Bezos is not the only genius on the planet. Others are good at e commerce too. WMT is making the transition. Closing some Sam Club stores to use as fullfillment centers is an example.You mention that WMT margins decreasing. Correct, however the argument is that Amazon e commerce business is operating at razor thin margins. WMT is realizing that investors will buy for growth as opposed to margin/profitability. Furthermore WMT has tbe cash to burn. Think Jet.com startup with WMT money behind them.WMT has a stake in JD.com which is their growth vehicle e commerce wise in China. Watch this partnership closely as they leverage this relationship as it relates to brands, e commerce, automated stores and synergies related to logistics.Good luck to everyone.

"As with all generalities, some made above need to be challenged. When one states that management is untested, one must be ignoring the aero business. This component has had relatively stable, technically knowledgeable management and the results show it. The digital twin, and  predictive maintenance concept were both pioneered and perfected in this business. Moreover the years of investment have yielded a very profitable service business which exploits the large fielded base. Where does anyone think the IofT thrust began? They have also pioneered in GE the use of Additive manufacture. The other businesses have not necessarily been managed consistently in the same manner. Power tended to resist the manager is a manager philosophy almost as much as engines, but the Alstom acquisition might be best described as a destabilizing event. The consumer businesses were cursed with a revolving door of hi-pots with little operating experience and focus on quarter to quarter financial results. Medical and Transportation were somewhere in the middle of the turnover issue. In general, medical tended to squeeze customer service and maintenance to achieve higher net and it has affected reputation negatively. Transportation has great Diesel engines, large fielded base, and some interesting performance based software to optimize locomotive usage but faces a down cyclical domestic market and the increasing possibility of electrically driven locomotive customer demand. Here, we see that the newly promoted CFO had the Business lead for two years with no previous operating product experience. This tendency to place business leaders at the head of departments whose experience is finance needs to change if GE is to reverse its recent downward trend and sustain new growth. If only businesses which have slow market dynamics or little technological change or no competitors or high cost of entry are the only ones which qualify as not too complex to manage, then renewables, IofT software, additive manufacturing are curious new thrusts in which to have invested.",

1) Why do you think you know better than Buffett does? You are making that assumption when you are saying you would buy today and he wouldn't. 2) What happens when GE cuts their dividend again?,
"GE is laying off employees, selling off divisions, and cut the divi in half. What will you get out of the various sales? Same as you got when shyster Immelt spun off of Synchrony Financial, NOTHING. Why would you expect GE's stock value to increase? This company is shrinking not growing. I see lower lows in the next 6 months at least.In my opinion GE is a lousy investment, they do not appreciate their investors nor do they work for them. When Conagra spun off Lamb Weston we got 100 shares (at no cost outlay) for every 300 Conagra shares we owned. My cost basis for Lamb Weston is $20.38/share, it's trading at $58.28 as of yesterdays close. Thank you Conagra. Screw GE until they get down to $12 Bucks which with the current slashed divi, restores a reasonable 4% divi yield. I expect 4% minimum yield in order to invest my hard earned money into GE for all the BS they have put investors through over the past years,Disclosure: I sold all my stock in GE at the end of December in order to get the tax deduction to offset Capital gains/Dividends on my portfolio.

"I read on an article on yahoo finance, $GE is worth $27 broken down on its main 4 businesses. So, long term, we just need to wait for the restructuring to work. Weather, the restructuring will take 1/2 years, we don't know yet.As far as stock valuation, we had a tax sale, and the opportunity to make a quick buck from Dec to now. If the market pulls back, it may give us a chance to buy again at a deep discount from the current $19's.February is a traditional low month on the market, it may give us an entry. I'd play this with long dated options. Let's see.",
"So the author owns GE but nelects to mention what his cost basis is. I doubt he loaded up at 17.25I see no reason to buy any GE before the q4 report is out.

There's also no short interst in the stock so there is not that cushion of shorts covering to give it a bump up.This is not the solid GE of old. This is a deeply damaged co, a wounded bird.

Buffett does not pay more than 10x pre tax earnings. In ge's case it's about $1 for 2017. Berkshire would buy ge stock in the range o $10. I doubt that Berkshire has a stake at this point,
The time to buy is now before the price runs up.  Same happened to Bank of America (BAC) when it was in the single digits.I also read that if GE was broken up the sum of the pieces are worth more than the current price.,
Whatever happened to the boost GE and others with money offshore were supposed to get with new tax bill? My understanding was that GE was one of the companies that was going to benefit the most!Is this wrong? Not a significant factor? Thoughts?,

"I'd buy ANY stock at the right price as long as it doesn't sell tobacco or fossil fuels. I think that the right price for GE will start with a 15 handle. Now in the 17th year of the big turnaround, directors who are clearly bored allowed Immelt to con them for 16, SIXTEEN years. Selling assets at the bottom, buying into OIL (?????) at the top. All the instincts of a sponge. Yeah, I can wait for GE to show me, don't tell me because I'm tired of listening to the promises.",
GE isn't going anywhere.,
"Well we do not have a crystal ball so we can not say where the bottom will be or where the high will be. Just the same we do  love the company as well as Warren because it does have about 10 streams of income for one thing so it will not go out of business.Now are we willing to by the stock at $19.00? Maybe for the dividend income. But for growth we feel the 12 month period could be a surprising large move. So what we did to reduce our exposure was to buy call options that were out of the money. Jan 18, 2019 Strike price 35 & 44. Our downside risk is 6 cents and 3 cents. Our up side could be $1.00 to $1.55. We feel comfortable that even if GE just goes to $25.00 we stand to see both options go to 30 to 45 cents.investmentgrand@aol.com Investment Grand group",
"Good analysis. Whether Buffett is buying or not does send an important signal. That he believes the GE business as it is, is moaty. That inherent stability allows a reasonable margin of safety to be estimated. As opposed to Buffett's early career where he would pick up cigar butts because there were still a few more puffs. The real value destroying element at GE is the poisonous corporate culture. All for the crony CEO and its minions. GE was never a super conglomerate. It rather was simply expert at promotion and drawing analysts in its game.There is no secret knowledge scientific management. However that delusion did great damage to our largest companies as GE cronies were hired as CEO. Home Depot being the clearest example. But sadly only one among many. Just how destructive is the GE 'way'? Just look at Home Depot before, during and after Nardelli. I would say the annalist's math with a fair value at $25+ is correct. But if the destructive crony capitalist culture is not reformed after the re-alignment? Then a massive value destructive management discount must be factored in. 20% being about right.",
"Morningstar has just designated GE as its top pick for 2018. Projects a stock target price of 26. After reading all the reasons given, I have a deja vu feeling I am at the beginnng of 2017, listening to Immelt and his parroting staff. They like the new management, think the plan broadly outlined by Flannery is a good one , that the IofT and additive manufacturing have good growth possibilities, etc. additionally GE has a “wide moat”. Presumably, this refers to competitive position. Of all the reasons for their assessment, I probably agree with the latter the most. This is just where I have the most problem with those who are constantly concluding that GE is too complex to manage. Given the fielded base, name recognition and the currency of their products and services, I believe the conclusion, that the businesses are too complex to manage borders on the absurd. The Morningstar assessment, I believe, is premature and sounds much too like the management spiel of late 2016 and 2017. I hope they are right, but I’m in the show me category and skeptical of rosy assessments. I also believe it would be better for the financial community to adopt that same posture and hold the new management’s feet to the fire. So far that management has made needed cost cutting moves and articulated a plan in November which is relatively general. It would be naive to believe that the only thing wrong was managements perks of charter aircraft, rental cars and an elaborate Boston office, Nor would it be a great thing for management to reduce staff in the power business after the Alstom acquisition. How else were they going to achieve the cost synergies projected that presumably contributed to the benefits of the acquisition.? More to the essence of positive change is the competence of  each business leader and their senior staff, the  approach to customer service, replacement parts and maintenance and in new applications of the IofT or software to do the systems engineering and hand holding that is required. How central R&D relates to the near term product improvements of each business and how in general are new product developments handled in such a way  that timing to market is right are problems which need to be addressed. Spending 4 billion on an internal development of IofT software without looking at the total system and organizational problems should serve as a case study.",

"Good information. With respect to FDA's reluctance to approve new testosterone products, I believe the benefit/risk  assessment of Libigel will overcome their reluctance. I have reason to believe that AbbVie picked up the torch where BPAX (now ANIP) left off in December 2012. At the time the Libigel safety study would have had over approx. 8,500 patient years of data. In 2011 BPAX filed patent applications that based on 4000 patient years of data they claimed restoring t-levels in postmenopausal women at risk of a cardiovascular event they reduced the the risk of experiencing such an event by at least 70%. The study was divided into two parts. The first part was the premarketing portion of the trial which BPAX completed. The second part was the post marketing phase of the trial. The 3656 patient trial was set up under an FDA SPA and an executive committee chaired by William B White, MD, a past president of the American Society of Hypertension. With over 7300 patient years of data, the data monitoring committee conducted 9 reviews and recommended continuing the trial without change.Unfortunately Libigel phase three pivotal efficacy trials treating HSDD experienced a very high placebo effect. The FDA was looking for a total of 5 years of safety data per patient. The post marketing follow up appears to have taken of the table when the efficacy trials failed to beat placebo. Interestingly, in December 2015 ANIP's patent agents added the claim that in addition to reducing cardiovascular events restoring T-levels reduced the number of breast cancer events. I recommend reviewing the patent application (see link) and through the USPTO Public Pair review the Specifications document and compare how much detail supports the claim of reducing cardiovascular events  vs the lack of details supporting the claim that it reduces breast cancer events. http://bit.ly/2vKGiPXThe breast cancer related claims being added approx. three years after BPAX completed their part of the study combined with no documentation to support the breast cancer related claims is consistent with someone other then ANIP having continued the study. Dr Michael Snabes, the study director for all Libigel trials and one of the listed inventors in the patent applications worked simultaneously for both BPAX and AbbVie in early 2013. Around April 2013, Dr Snabes was hired by AbbVie as their Sr Medical Director of Men and Women's Health. Considering the timing, it appears that AbbvIe most likely made the breast cancer reduction discovery. NOTE: Neither cardiovascular or breast cancer discoveries have ever been publicly disclosed, other than in patent applications.  If I am correct in my assumptions, Abbvie would have completed the second part of the trial  trial and now has  5 years of data per patient. They would be sitting on approx. 18,200 patient years of data which would have been completed around August 2016.  Just something you and your reader may wish to explore.",

"Good article. I’d like to add a couple of comments: 1) Phase I production rate was a very close match to predictions when graphed versus CO2 injection volume. Injection rates set the rate of response, and they were lower than predicted due to several factors, including wettability of the rock and inter connectivity of zones on 20 acre spacing. Increasing injection rates has been a focus, including downspacing and frac treating of injection wells.2) Phase III has been approved, and will expand project to 1200+ acres. 3) they have had some days of 3000+ bopd. 4) considering it is serial # 0000001, I’d say pretty darn good!",

If that didn't work I'd give him a ride n the company helocopter and sell him some long term commitments to buying CO2.At some price it is ""free cash flow"" considering the existing infra-structure is already there.If done efficiently it could very well be the next technology that keeps the price of oil low but in great demand - and the USA has an awful lot of it!!Great story to be watching.Thanks again.Bob",

"Agree with Technosemi - I stopped buying crappy HP stuff years ago.  You couldn't upgrade their computers - had to buy a new one, and their printers just fell apart.  And I'm easy on equipment.  I like the idea of 3D printers, but it is early.....and I don't trust HP to make a quality product.   By the way, my son, who is a software engineer, builds my computers for me.  From the best components out there.  Sorry about what you call 'whining', but didn't Peter Lynch say something about buying companies that make products that you like?",

And with better and longer warranty and lifetime free live support.  Bad news for mass-produced, cheapest quality products from HPQ.",
"HP doesn't deserve its success.  Every computer they make is made with the same, cheap parts, mostly the lowest quality brands from China.  Want a list?  The cheapest disc drives they can purchase, as they are too cheap and money-grabbing to provide something like an LG DVR, which we can buy at $15 in a computer store, when they would pay less.Their desktops use cheap fans whose bearings start to wobble and make noise after a year or so.  The power supplies are among the cheapest available, even the internal A/C ones, but you'll find cheap, underpowered wall-wart power supplies in even their expensive machines.The author states,  ""Qualitatively, it's intuitive to understand why HP's PC business is so strong; there's really something for everyone. Its higher-end Spectre line serves the $1,000+ market, HP ENVY serves the ~$800-1,000 market, and its lower-priced HP Pavilion offerings cater to the cheaper end. HP laptops resonate well with all segments of buyers and have a cachet of quality - unlike Lenovo, which despite having higher-end offerings of its own, is often perceived as a budget system.""Something for everyone?  But all of them are made out of the same cheap parts, poor fit, thin metal or plastic.  As far as their laptops having ""a cachet of quality,""  they have become cheaper, all metal has been eliminated and cheap, thin plastic that flexes and scratches extremely easily; cheap keyboards that sag as you type on them; and plastic hinges that feel like they are ready to bust, and do bust --- all of this hardly exudes a cachet of quality.Within one year, the cheap Seagate hard drive they use failed on my ""high-end"" Phoenix.  My fan will start to wobble.  And my 2-1/2 year old machine is still better made than their new ones whose metal is way thinner.HP rips off their customers on any replacement parts.  They charge 4x the price for the same or inferior memory that you can buy direct from Crucial with a LIFETIME free replacement warranty, while HP offers one year.  All their prices on any part you want are totally outrageous.  Their customer service is pathetic.  You can spend hours on the phone with people who know almost nothing, but they are trained to refuse any help on a unit just out of warranty with a part failure.  I had one of their laptops about 8 years ago, and returned it when I should have kept it.  Not that it was particularly high-end, but the hinged cover was entirely made of substantial metal, as were the hinges, and the keyboard didn't depress down, but was firm.  Of course, it would be almost obsolete by now.HP might be doing well as a company, which simply shows you how marketing and a superficial slick look that to the more discerning eye, immediately shows what cheap junk they are.  This goes to show you how low the bar is, and how clueless their customers are.Yes, most of the common brands are made cheaply with cheap parts.  The only way to get a well-built computer with quality parts is to built it yourself or get one made at a major computer store, like MicroCenter, or online stores like New Egg.",

"HPQ  grows on all fronts and the reason is their new innovation capability . Very undervalued so much more gains still. Good execution as well, including 3D printers strategy.",
Caution. HP is getting an increasing share in a declining market.,
"I'm incomplete, you're incomplete, the author is incomplete, we're all incomplete, as in we all scream for ice cream.The printer business has been viewed as a rapidly dying business because everything has gone electronic. But HP's market share in printers is about twice what it is in PCs. They just purchased a medium sized Japanese printer business, they are doubling down. Mark my words - the printer business will prove to be a huge money maker for HP in the years to come. The reason is they are managing for a declining units sold curve by driving down their cost per unit. With a market share in the 40%+ range they will rule pricing via printer supplies, the razor blade model.Additionally, MB, you got an 'incomplete' because you did not mention 3D printing. While very small now, it will grow in prominence in a few years. HP has stated they intend to disrupt manufacturing industries with 3D printers. I don't believe that is an idle threat. So while they are investing now in 3D the payoff will be in 5-10 years. Understandably, the stock price does not reflect that now but will in a few years.HPQ is my 'Forever' stock, no end in sight. I get an 'Incomplete' because I did not mention the high quality of HPQ management.",

cause they figure they have enough voting or power to vote against the newstrike deal,
Sorry for the typo. What I meant to say is that Aurora is purchasing smaller amounts of CanniMed stock. Why?,
Aurora’s share purchase of CanniMed stock is becoming s,

I took a quarter position between mid 8's and 7.75 and hoping the selling continues so I can buy even lower. I see my shares doubling this year and doubling again by 2020.,
"LDSYF, due your DD, but this company is hitting all the right marks.",
"I have been saying that too...CanniMed is not worth the headache. There are other avenues to meet the anticipated demand. I don't care how much cash Aurora has, they are offering way too much for CanniMed. Aurora has a responsibility to its own shareholders before they court CanniMed's. Considering how much CanniMed has resisted this, why exactly has Aurora sat around for two plus months after announcing it was going for a hositle takeover? They could have easily had a deadline weeks ago for CanniMed shareholders and then worked this through the securities board afterwards if they went for it. Hopefully the shareholders do not go for it, Aurora is forced to take another route, and the lawsuit will be dismissed.",
"If Aurora can buyout CanniMed as planned for $24 a share plus 4.52 shares of Aurora, that knocks down Aurora's current value to $5.31 a share. That's a major reason for Aurora's recent sell-off and why many of us believe it has offered too much for CanniMed.",
"The only speculation in the value of these companies is when will Canada legalize recreational cannabis.  It’s not if, but when.  And, too much tax and jobs for Canada to ignore.  Worst case it’s delayed.  Once in lifetime chance for a new industry....buy and hold...especially after corrections.",
Could an experienced technician please breakdown the Cannabis sector from an Elliott wave theory point of view. I am far less confident. TIA.,
"On any spec stock, first rule take out your initial investment and let the rest fly, then play all you want. No matter what happens your won't loose any of your own hard earned cash. Its ALL upside from then on. There are no metrics to value any of these companys so its speculation but as long as you know that everything is Ok.Good Luck and remember take YOUR money out FIRST.",
"Aurora is now down 31% off it’s high of $11.87 and led Canadian pot stocks in volume on 01/12/2018. That CanniMed $725 mil lawsuit obviously hurt Aurora, but brought the stock down to where it should have been trading ($8.28) all along. Most Canadian pot stocks were trading down in sympathy with Aurora which shows me how strong this stock effects the market. When the American exchange reopens on Tuesday, I’ll add to my position in Aurora along with my position in Namaste Technologies: NXTTF which was also knocked down to a reasonable trading level. Every contributor here knows how volatile these players are which is why using dollar cost averaging for purchases should pay off for long term investors. IF the lawsuit is dismissed look for Aurora to rebound to the $11-12 level, and other pot stocks will ride its coattails.",
If the senate passes the bill BOOM.,
ACBFF and a few others stock could triple it's value between this year and 2019.So take advantage of the dips. Look at it as bargain sales.,
"Revenues will boom in time, but not without a corresponding increase in assets to support that growth. Assets require funding, and investors provide funds only in exchange for returns --cost of capital.Since this company has no competitive advantages, the benefits of growth will be reaped by those new investors, not by current shareholders.That means investors should pay for the company the value of the assets, but no more. The stock is trading at 15+ times book value, so unless they hold some massive hidden asset we are not aware of, this company is as overvalued as it gets.",
The speculative enthusiasm on here is scary. Whole industry is overvalued. Be careful m friends,
"Sessions has nothing to do with Canada,.no effect!..with that said, he will have No Effect in u.s..",
"Analysis of Aurora needs to include their constant stock dilution.  Of all the Canadian cannabis stocks, this one is by far the most diluted.  Just watch their warrant announcements and time your purchases accordingly.  Longer-term, will Aurora ever do stock buy-backs?",
this is going to hurt...http://bit.ly/2FxmfHr,
"I am anticipating Aurora to outperform my expectations, especially with Germany/Scandinavia. Thumbs up to Justin Trudeau and a huge thumbs down to that puritanical idiot Jeff Sessions. The way to go is to invest in Canadian pot stocks. Any input on CCAN (Canadian Cannabis)?Wondering why it seems to be bottoming out.",
"I have more than doubled my investment with this stock over the past few months. However, the back and forth Hatfield and McCoy wranglings with CanniMed have adversely affected this stock. First, it is a hostile takeover (which I have no issue with), but CanniMed has been resisting at all costs, trying to influence their own shareholders by launching their own takeover bids of smaller pot companies. It is a big mess and today CanniMed filed a lawsuit for $765 million against Aurora alleging interference with contract, violations of the securities act. This was NOT worth the headache. Cannimed has delusions of grandeur and this hostile takeover should have concluded a while ago. And Aurora is paying too much. The lawsuit will likely be dismissed but damage has been done to an otherwise high flying company. I am holding my shares and hoping sound business judgement rules the day.",
Today CanniMed filed a 725 million lawsuit against Aurora claiming Aurora’s wrongdoing relative to the hostile bid. Just how hostile could this get?,

Smart move by FB to help hold the regulators at bay.,
Let’s calm down about FB. They are on a roll.,
I don't use Facebook but bought shares at $70. Hold in taxable account and IRA.,
"first, use Facebook and see what the actual changes are in terms as a user and see if the experience is better for both users and business ads. if the targeted business ads is not impacted or negligible, then the changes are moot as it's a win-win. all these assumptions are baseless unless you can actually quantify the user experience changes and business impact, if any.",
"FB stock should be up on today’s news, not down 4%. And the drop was desired. Mark Zuckerberg is doing exactly what he should be- proactively anticipating ways in which to both improve the service and counter detractors- especially those within governments worldwide. These actions will have a positive long term impact and are subject to managements modifications if they fail to achieve their desired effect. FB is set to release their most recent quarterly results at the end of this month. They will likely have top and bottom line growth exceeding 40%. The bottom line may greatly exceed this matrix. FB remains the cheapest large cap growth stock (a forward PE in the mid 20’s, if not lower as estimates are regularly blown out) with risk adjusted potential superior to all others. This dip will just be another opportunity in a long line of others. Politically, the stock drop was exactly what Zuckerberg wanted. A clear statement that he was placing the product above profits.",
I am pretty certain that the panic selling and $8 + drop will be made back two or three times over starting on. Tuesday when trading resumes.,
"why should anyone buy FB when it's going down and it may go down more when they can buy another other stock that will keep going higher. that is the dilemma many investors face. Why not buy Baba, Tencent, Bidu, amazon, etc etc.",
Truth is....This dip was the best thing that could have happen to many smart investors that just RAN to such an opportunity to buy in some more before it sky rockets way above $200.00,
"I would buy more except I am already all in and FB is one of my largest holdings and one that I intend to hold through the coming correction, although I may lighten up a bit.  FB is a great GARP stock.Note that all of the decline happened before the market opened and in the first minute of trading.  I call the first half hour of trading, and especially the first twenty minutes ""amateur hour"".  In this case it was ""amateur minute"".  The upward trend is still intact.  BTFD.",

I missed out on all the tech gains. Saw this 4% dip as a perfect opportunity to jump in.,
"Zuckerberg said, ""It's important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world.""  It seems to me his priority is that more Facebook is good for the world. Is what's good for the world good for the shareholders? Not necessarily. Therefore, this dip is not silly.",
"Author: ""Facebook stock is dropping again as Zuckerberg continues to beat the drum of safety and healthiness over profitability. Facebook is simply crafting a long-term narrative that makes itself the hero and ensures healthy relationships with users and advertisers.""- The power of Zuckerberg's charisma and messaging is evident in the fact that people are selling. If investors are buying the message, so is likely the general public. It's kind of ironic. It's image management guys! Don't fall for it, it's meant for politicians and customers, not for us investors!",

"i think the move is excellent. the opportunity to enjoy facebook is greater thus the happier the users the merrier theirbusinesses, that lead to more clicks. those analysts either should quit their day jobs or have limited ability to see through. buy buy and buy. no doubt, an easy call.",
The analyst is reacting as if the CEO is a fool.He perfectly sees the hurdles on the path.The company is disliked by many in other countries.The CEO is perfectly right that he might have contradictory issues on the path with others and his wit won't be sufficient to handle those obstacles.He is pointing to the advertisement revenue problems which is as expected if he is not an idiot like some in the investment world..That will negatively effect the stock price it means it will slowly go down without having a direct relation about the character of CEO.,

Today was a best buying opportunity before it explodes past 200 and keeps growing. My respect towards the company and Mark grew after the announcement as they are more concerned about that the engagement . FB apps are used by almost by every other person on the earth and they do have social responsibility which they have handled in dignity. As someone mentioned they announced this now rather than during the results so that people don’t panic sell after wonderful Q4 results.Everyone will forget after the long weekend and FB will be back in action again.,

For years people are saying FB is for old people and other companies will overtake them. This was the best for the investors to be happening,...it caused for the stock to have a low valuation and so, low risk. Every dip is a change to get in.

I bought too. Your article is totally correct,
"Thanks for the article.I agree with your ""Final Thoughts"" and believe that those that sold today certainly DON'T UNDERSTAND FB and will rue the day they sold.Long   FB",
Was a bit surprised how beat up FB was today.   I do think FB should use some of their money to diversify some.   Nothing wrong with ads but eventually the ad revenue available will slow.  There is a ton more from TV but FB is getting pretty big and growth takes more revenue and will get tough.,
"If it stays down Tuesday, I'll be selling puts. Win win IMHO.",
"I agree with what you are saying. The pull back we saw today is only temporary and I see it as an opportunity. I recall several years ago, when the skeptical argued that monetization in going to desktops to an emphasis on handheld devices, was the end of FB. Monetization has occurred happened and has being prolific for its revenues. My guess is that the same will happen for Instagram and WhatsApp. These platforms are unexplored and full of potential for FB, seeing the popularity that exists in foreign countries.",
FB certainly gifts you in the long term.,
Have been with Facebook since the IPO and will keep buying it. A company with a billion users will always be in my recommend list.,

Agree with your overall sediment.  I actually bought more FB at the close today before reading this opinion piece.  Just look at the volume compared to the avg.  Let’s just say it was through the roof which I view as positive.  Long FB.,
Facebook will be a once in a lifetime investment.,
"it will be positive long term. short term, ahead of earnings, this was a warning imo. They always play down estimates and then blow them away, but it's a show me situation short term when FANG is dare I say the last place to reap big gains right now. But it will be again and Longs will be rewarded for their patience here.",
"FB continues to have tons of haters.  It continues to grow at a very reasonable value.  It just doesn't have the edgy ""driverless cars brah"" of tesla or ""mysterious"" ""sector destroying"" ethos of amazon to really boom to a stratospheric P/E.  A big reason FB does so well is that Zuckerberg does what is best for the long term.  Shareholders cry about it -- like today -- and praise it a year down the road.  We've seen this story already.  Long FB.  The stock has hit some turbulence though and may fall further still.  I'll buy more in the 160s and ride it back up.",
The recent news has made Facebook even more of a buy. That Zuckerberg is prioritizing engagement over short term revenues is a huge positive and makes the investment far more credible.,
Bought on the dip today,
"it's amazing how negative people have been on FB for years. I bought today, this dip was a gift",

"Intel has a colossus marketing department, huge marketing/brive budgets, and of course lots of puppet analysts..No matter what, Intel is, and will be, in a down cycle:1. Intel used to own 99% of the PC market since AMD was out for 5 years building its cpu, gpu, apu, and chip fabric architectures and products. THERE IS ZERO CHANCE INTEL WILL KEEP 99% OF THE MARKET SHARE AND KEEP CHARGING DOUBLE FOR THEIR PRODUCTS..   WAKE UP PEOPLE..!!2. Now Qualcomm has a cheap x86 emulator that will rob market share from Intel3. AMD is back not only with high end CPUs but high end GPU, and HSA native APUs4. Intel sells around 200 million integrated gpus per-year, not AMD is selling the high-end GPUs to Intel and AMDs APUs trample all of the obsoleted Intel integrated gpus..  AMD is getting a profit bonanza selling part or in the future all of the 200 million gpus.. AMD is getting very good money selling those GPUs to Intel.. and fake news say AMD can't produce enough Vega GPUs.. wrong.. AMD is selling a large quantity of a variety of GPUs to APPLE, Intel, OEMs, etc..  5. On 2018/2019, AMD will be releasing 7 nm. chips that will enable AMD to release high-end x86-64 cpus, gpus, and apus that can be used on smartphones and tablets..6. EPYC2, Ryzen2, etc.. will make AMD out-perform or around Intel best chips.. AMD still have a pcie number of lanes advantage and scalable fabric that will keep AMD performance highly desirable for servers.7. Server and cloud companies have learned from Meltdown and Spectre that they cannot trust and/or rely on Intel.. AMD is already cashing in with all the server and cloud vendors and ramping server profits even faster than expected.8. Intel is dropping its product prices, Intel profits are being killed..Intel has enough money to move around and look like it is healthy, but Intel is in a down cycle and will lose 40% to 60% of its PC, server, and cloud market share to its competitors..Even Apple does not need Intel any more and is cutting down on Intel products because Apple can produce its own chips with even better overall performance than Intel and for a lower price..AMD is becoming a cash cow, since its normal just CPU value is around $40, and now that it has high-end GPU and APU high-end products, its price is between $60 and $100..While Intel is losing market share and has to half its product prices, AMD is recovering its market share big time and it is a multi-TAM company with parallel profits coming from owning CPU, GPU, and APU products that are matching or exceeding Intel products for a fraction of the price.. Intel doubled their prices and their profit when it did not have any competition, but now it will have to lose all that monopolistic profit. Companies just don't want to pay double and lose money knowing that they are being screwed..I will not touch Intel stock until Intel can produce a new architecture that can compete with AMDs new architecture and products.. AMD just released the 2st generation of its products, and it almost wiped Intel supremacy on all areas.. servers, computation, etc..Intel, too, is a dying company without its own high-end GPU technology.. VR, AR, AI, gaming, 3d graphics, visualization, etc.. all require high-end GPU intellectual property and patent portfolio, which Intel does not have.. and currently Intel is borrowing from AMD at a steep price..Like Lisa Su said several times.. She can make AMD earn a lot of money.. and she will with all the excellent products released, the incoming 12+ nm chips, the 7 nm chips, and the incoming architectural improvements to EPYC, Ryzen, etc..And we are talking CPUs, GPUs, and APUs here.. not only CPUs and not only GPUs like some other competing companies that only have one high-end technology and no hybrid high-end technologies like AMD has just released and which is using to ramp up serious profit..AMD is having an historical comeback story, and once the current stock manipulation ends, since whoever is doing it will be losing lots of money, AMD will shot to its expected $40 to $60 just to begin with, and within 5 years it will be in the $100 to $200 range with all its cpu, gpu, and apu products and once AMD enters the 7 nm chip smartphone and tablet, etc..",
"Mostly true, but like Intel, you seriously underestimate the impact on performance:- The older the processor, the bigger the impact. With Haswell processors, you definitely feel the difference and the energy cost will increase notably.- Anecdotal evidences from companies on AWS and other clouds tend to show far-from-single digits performances losses.Regarding class action, patch installation cost, post patch troubles and post patch installation of additional software that did not work correctly after the patch must be taken into account. In my opinion, there is indeed ground for compensation.Finally, Intel lost an opportunity to shine. Its response was borderline disdainful and disingenuous, It offered no goodwill, or rebate on new processors. I could have done many things to transform a crisis into an opportunity.",
Good to see AMD green premarket while cryptocurrencies are tanking,
"The key is data center biz.I dont think consumers will be affected much. They'll buy whatever the marketing folks or adverts tell them to, or whatever looks shinny on today's menu.The data centers are big on virtualization and tight-squeezed on bottomlines. They will dump low dollar performance chips in a hurry.But the big question is which new chip will they buy to replace the old ? will they stick with Intel or switch to AMD/NVDIA/Qualcomm?My humble guess is they will probably diversify just a little but not by much.",
I think Intel should be around half its current value. It really has nothing going for it right now. A bug in all its CPU's that has a lot of customers angry and switching to AMD. They are years behind Nvidia in Automotive and AI.They are divorcing Micron. They don't have good graphics in house.. Should have bought Imagination Technologies on the cheap...  McAfee and Mobileye where way to overpriced.So why is it so overvalued? They will lose a lot of market share and they will have much lower margins.. So the current price doesn't make any sense.,

The cause of Intel chips being affected by Meltdown, due to mishandling (or cheating on handling) privilege levels, is:1) A design bug (a deviation from the specification) or2) A specification flaw, intentional or not (according to Intel CEO, no design bug and its chips operate as designed and intended).",
"Mark,The point I was making is that it is relative performance and reputational advantage to the already resurgent AMD.AMD will have the benefit of newer 12nm process, a newer core Zen+, and a TBD advantage in security related performance. What this does to Intel is that it impacts business in the highest ASP and margin market. Even a small loss in market share will have disproportionate impact on profitability. That is what makes it dire. An, on top of that, as I point out, most, if not all, next generation chips will be pushed out by several months to make security fixes in hardware.",

thank you for the article! here's to a Monday rebound! Long AMD,
MarkYou focused on Spectre which is common to all the major cpu vendors (though much less on amd it seems) but didn’t focus on the only issue which is different across vendors and that is obviously Meltdown.  In the end that will be what matters out of all of this - how much will Meltdown cause a shift from Intel to AMD.  That is the real story here and yet the article doesn’t address it at all?,
One heck of an upgrade cycle coming - and we will all buy form the the very companies that screwed it up the first time...,
"Mark I know you're an Nvidia fan, and rightly so, but it seems your datacentre predictions that include a GPU-based migration of effort from CPUs equally apply to AMD. Sure, Nvidia has a commendable lead in products like Xavier, but AMD's approach to gain share from Intel is two-pronged - CPU experience that stretches back to Opteron, and GPU credibility to back it up. They have to be contenders in this space - and worthy ones.",
"Mark just wanted to say thank you.. I've traded one stock in apple since 45 dollars split adjusted. You convinced me to get in  NVDA at 92...I then caught you on my tv Bloomberg app talking about FNSR, I put it on my watch list and watched their upcoming conference call and bought before apple anouncement.

They sped up Vega 7nm because they have to have a double precision GPU for HPC... My guess is t'll be mixed-precision... Since it's a shrink they can do two - one for gaming and one for HPC\ML...So I would say that only AMD is a threat...

"Mark, I enjoyed your thoughtful insights.  Everyone is effected by the current security vulnerabilities but they will be resolved by everyone, I am sure.  Intel is a manufacturer with enormous resources unlike AMD who cannot afford to panic their limited users.I see big DataCenter users sticking with the one company who has the deep pockets to support them now and into the foreseeable future.  If AMD has a flaw and needs to burn cash to keep their customers, it could put them out of business.  Very risky partner to have from a macro economic sense.I like NVDA but it is too high for its current dilution for me.  Intel is approaching AI in many ways so I will stay INTC long with the better dividend choice but will keep my eye on NVDA for any pull-back to take a position.Still wish the AMD trolls would actually contribute something constructive.  They must be desperate and took a crappy position.  AMD's stock history is a rocky road.  I like loyalty but I like making profits better.  Sell your position and buy NVDA or INTC if you want to make a decent Long ROI.",

Intel will soon be dropping like a toilet seat.,
"He's just regurgitating Intel's marketing material, which has already been shown to be highly deceptive and intentionally misleading.  And not just by a little.  I consider it to be worse than lying.  It's lawyer-filtered nonsense meant for consumption by stupid media outlets like CNBC.For example, the most recent material that talks up the low performance losses from these bug fixes *starts* at Skylake, intentionally ignoring the fact that most of the installed systems in the world are pre-Skylake and take a huge hit from these mitigations.  And the material also focuses on consumer experiences and completely avoids talking about the server or cloud space.Security is job #1 at Intel?  No, it isn't.  And it hasn't been for a long time.  Intel just cares about how people perceive its marketing.  Security has been ignored for ages.  Intel's first reaction to everything is that it is someone else's fault or that it doesn't have an impact (even when it does), or that they are working with their 'partners' to bring fixes in... papering over the fact that most of their end users and many of their commercial customers will never actually see those fixes.You should see what they are trying to impose on their customers now.  They want us to completely refactor compilers for every single language in existence and recompile everything with horrid hacks.  They've provide almost no real documentation on how to work around these bugs, except to Microsoft and Linux.  They haven't given us any clues as to the real cost of these mitigations... instead leaving to us to test the code paths and overheads ourselves.Intel's entire focus is on creating as large a deception and as much confusion as possible.  That's what their idea of 'working with their customers' means.  It's total nonsense.-Matt",

"Decent article Mark. But you miss a key point. Without the CPU system replete with memory the GPU is merely a useless paperweight.Intel have the CPU, The 3DXpoint memory, and the FPGA. The also have bought in AI and Deep learning IP. It is only a matter of time before Intel do what they have always done. Integrate everything slowly onto an MCM and then eventually on die they even have the Fabric already on die for all this integration in the latest Xeon.It may take 5 7 10 years?

"I dunno Mark. Intel still shits the bed on PCI lanes. I wouldn't be surprised if data centers used Epyc with Nvidia GPU's.In the storage scenario Intel can't even offer that amount of connectivity on PCI lanes. That's less HDD's/SSD's and an overall smaller amount of throughout capabilities.Don't get me wrong, their IPC has it's place but I don't feel it's in cloud storage or heavy GPU parallelism (AI).I'd invest in Intel strictly on the new memory fab. We all know AMD can't retain a high stock price with the pump and dump constantly hitting them.",

"Foil hat in place.  Abercrombie said it would eliminate the offensive branding of its clothing.  Management lied again and no one wants to wear a brand that lost a discrimination case in the Supreme court, has paid millions in settlement to employees and managers it ripped off, and customers and employees it called ""fat"" if they wore above a size medium.  You have to remember how offensive the CEO and the brand was saying only cool people should wear Abercrombie.  And on all the settlement fees paid to employees it ripped off.  ANF excluded millions off the income statement because it said payments for wages to employees were not a current operating expense.  Is that a scam or what?  Taking back pay off the income statement is how they were able to post a small profit in the third quarter.....But wait.....ANF is still currently operating at a loss through 3 quarters.  And of course they will CREATE a profit in the third quarter despite all the adds I get in my mail and e mail for 50 to 70 percent off everything.  But they will ignore margins and find a way to twist the quarter positive.  Options are not cheap and selling puts is how the hedge funds keep this ponzie scheme going.  91 cent loss in the first quarter 16 cent profit second quarter 30 cent profit created by excluding milions in back pay settlement money......ANF is operating the year at a 45 cent loss on declining sales for over 3 years.  But they never mention that because the hedge funds control the press releases.  All you heard was a positive comp number for Hollister as they close hundreds of stores.  OH but closing stores is POSITIVE.  Give me a break.  Also, they play big financial games with foreign operations and the valuation of the dollar, they always seem to create pro forma accounting adjustments that always seem to beat lowered estimtes.   2017 so far is a loss year.  And the stock went from 12 to 19 because they posted 30 cents on excluded payroll expenses.",

"First of all, Abercrobie has fumbled the past three years trying to find a target customer.  They have CURRENTLY settled in with the same customers they offended years ago with their arrogant and offensive attitude.  This too will fail along with the last three years hitting and missing badly.  They are also claiming that they are cost cutting.  This is another broken record promise of ANF coming back.  They are just too far gone and are going bankrupt.  The customer posting about the great product can keep this crap clothing.  American Eagle is beating Abercrombie badly, Abercrombie for kids has failed, and Hollister, while it is selling jeans, can not compete profitabilly.   I find ANF cash flow to be negative.  They are losing money but the stock is pumped by paid print that wants investors to beleive that beating constantly lowered estimates is a come back story.  Here is my theory on the dividend and why the stock has gone from 12 to 19 dollars on negative results.  Note that the float is owned and controled over 98% by hedge funds and institutions.  The only retail investors in ANF are currently short, but the hedge funds control the bid and ask and keep this sinking ship afloat buy getting investors who see some of the worts fundamentals and short or option the stock. Then they squeeze you out by buying and selling to other institutions and hedge funds that control the float by over 98%.  ANF does not PAY the dividend.  That is my theory.  Their proforma accounting is a joke and frankly I do not understand how they get away with it as it boarders on fraud.  Plus they just got the SEC to agree to allow them to hide more of their accounting games.  ANF does not pay the dividend, the hedge funds do not take the dividend and they leave the yield out there to snag unsuspeceting investors looking for a good yield.  I know this sounds crazy but I beleive it is true as I have followed this company for 4 and a half years and have watched the financials turn into a proforma game of misleading presentation of the financials.  About 6 months ago, ANF tried to go private at 12.00 a share.  And there was absolutely no interest in buying the damaged and hated brand of Abercrombie.  Management is old and clueless and have to accept stock as compensation becasue there is no cash to pay them.  At 12.00 there was no takers and now one quarter later the stock is at 19.00?  Fundamentally this is a 6 to 8 dollar stock.  But you are up against hedge funds and institutions that manipulate this stock.  Be cautious shorting the obvious because crooks conrol this stock.  I truly beleive that based on almost 5 years of tracking and monitoring it daily.  ANF did not release a cash flow statement for the third quarter.  BIG RED FLAG.  But crooks run free on Wall Street because crooks make plenty of money.",
"Analysts will revise up, not really shortable until ~$30-40. You can't focus on earnings, need to look at cash flow.

Dividend is safe unless there is significant deterioration in operations.",

"I bought ANF for 8.97$ in July 13 and is not going to sell until it hits 23$. This is what was my plan all along and I will stick to it. And I never sell on the top of the market.Now let me explain why this stock has a rally and why have you missed it when I did not.Abercrombie is a cool kids brand. When I say kids I mean successful adult males and females from 20 to late 50 of age who prefer to dress fashionable but on reasonable budget.  This brand targets predominantly white and asian demographic  and does it without much of serious competition. No one else in this segment targets this exact demographic so specifically.Sure there are some brands that kinda compete with A&F like for example American Eagle (too childish, luck of taste), Gap (complete luck of taste), Banana Republic (not great quality, high prices), Express (bad quality, not appealing fashion). After checking all the competition I found that A&F is indeed the best and deserves premium price despite restructuring effort company is going trough. You do not need to trust me - market already does.Abercrombie has a long history (more than 100 years) and the right target demographic. This combination makes it attractive to Asian investors who have manufacturing resources but do not have name recognition and loyal following in North America, Middle East and Europe. A&F does have it all. This company had almost have been acquired about the same time last year. But it was not bidders management was hopping for (some cheap American apparel makers). Now it might be different and market knows it.What about closing stores. Everyone does it now. It is not specific for A&E.

"A couple of comments:Regarding the mid stream: The mid stream comapny has already been spun off and IPO'd. The company is called Hess Mid Stream Partners LP (HESM). Hence, the potential to raise additional cash as described in the article is not really there.About the cash situation: The article says 5 billion in cash equals 30% of market cap. The net cash is not 5 billion, more like 2.5. And a big chunk of it will be spent in Guyana.The article misses one major point in my mind - a view of the quality of the management of the company. By taking a look at Hess presentations 4-5 years back it appears that they said more or less the same back then, just that the growth would come from different assets compared to now. They have not delivered.  In my mind the best that can happen to the shareholders is that Elliott Management will succeed in their attempt to fire the CEO or force him to sell the company.

Just had my meltown patch pushed to my Intel I5 PC and rebooted.  Cold boot took about 50 minutes. Businesses are gonna have fun come Tuesday morning when the boot up their PC's.,
"Structure of PriceI know you are not anti-AMD, but I am shocked that you would write an article stating that AMD is extremely vulnerable to Spectre when, by its very architecture, is practically fully immune to such attacks.  I will provide supporting details and a link below, but I first want to quote (paraphrased and shortened) some of what you stated with some comments of mine added: ""... the other processor flaw, .... Spectre, exposes devices to the same vulnerability, it is present in chips manufactured by Intel, AMD, and ARM Holdings. Patches have been developed to address Meltdown, but there is currently no solution to cure the Spectre vulnerability. Consequently, AMD has very significant exposure to this issue.  ***Very significant exposure?  By its very design, AMD is almost completely immune; as it possesses a unique architecture that Spectre has only a miniscule chance at ever penetrating into an AMD Zen CPU.  It is Intel that has huge vulnerability problems and has sloppily designed horrid patches that are creating huge problems when applied, as you state as follows***Required Substantial RedesignAdding to the damage to Intel's reputation, it has been reported that the patches developed to address Meltdown will slow processors by between 5 and 30 percent. Intel has equivocated (use language to conceal the truth) about this statistic....but the fact remains that the flaw in its chip design has already required a substantial redesign of Windows and Linux memory kernels.....It has been said that in the worst case, the software fix causes huge slowdowns in typical workloads and is expensive to effect.The concerns now for AMD are the currently exposed vulnerability of its processors to Spectre and the likelihood that, as with Meltdown, the fix when developed will significantly slow computer and be expensive for the company to implement. (END OF QUOTE)........In both of Lisa Su's live discussions of Meltdown and Spectre, it is obvious that expressing herself is not her strong point, possessing the style of a high-level techie, talking fast and running through her points as if she were talking to a fellow techie, instead of on the level that a financial writer / reporter can understand.  Then, this Yahoo guy really doesn't get it, and fixates on whatever else has been in the neurotic financial churn machine.This is in stark contrast to Krzanich, who utlizes slick BS answers and haughty put-downs of AMD, ARM, QCOM and MSFT.  In Su's first video, she used the words ""near-zero chance"" and an emphatic ""rare"" to describe how hard it would be for Spectre to penetrate AMD's chips.  The problem really ballooned when, in Dr. Su, in her second interview from CES with the Yahoo reporter said that ""Spectre can affect our processors"".  I and others believe she poorly chose her words hastily, and was feeling under pressure to cover all bases, so she unfortunately chose the words she did without going into detail on the different type of branch predictor, etc. that would have put a whole different perspective on this, and shown the superiority and innovation that AMD has over Intel and others.  The finance/talking head/analyst world just took this and ran with it to see how many sensationalized articles and statements they could produce from this.Fears should have been 95% alleviated by other subsequent articles, like the one from Ars Technica, which gave clarity to the Spectre issue.  And there are others that almost no one flapping their mouths has even read.  Only the techies here who have combed the internet and the hard-core tech sites that talk about this sort of stuff, have exposed how way over the top the reaction has been to what they consider almost a non-issue for AMD's CPU's, due to the different type of branch predictor in the Zen architecture that makes it basically immune to Spectre invasion.Quoting from the article discussing the new patches from INTC and AMD, and here is the link also:http://bit.ly/2qXvcqs""Zen's branch predictor, however, is a bit different. AMD says that its predictor always uses the full address of the branch; there's no flattening of multiple branch addresses onto one entry in the BTB. This means that the branch predictor can only be trained by using the victim's real branch address. This seems to be a product of good fortune; AMD switched to a different kind of branch predictor in Zen (like Samsung in its Exynos ARM processors, AMD is using simple neural network components called perceptrons), and the company happened to pick a design that was protected against this problem.""EXCELLENT ARTICLE that should have been quoted and given the due it deserves.The problem has been that AMD has remained too silent since, only causing others to think there is a problem where the problem is minor at best.  AMD, is in the process of developing an iron-clad fix and patch that can be used by not just themselves, but by others, to solve this for the whole industry.SA writers should be digging into AMD's architecture if they are writing about AMD, and I respectfully think Structure of Price, while finding out some important information, needs to dig deeper, as this is more oriented towards the messed-up architecture of Intel and possibly some others, than applicable to AMD.",

"The cause of Intel chips being affected by Meltdown, due to mishandling (or cheating on handling) privilege levels, is:1) A design bug (a deviation from the specification) or2) A specification flaw, intentional or not (according to Intel CEO, no design bug and its chips operate as designed and intended).Could the cost of avoiding the Spectre cases like  the cost of asking people just to walk but not to drive or flight for avoiding accidents?",
"Intel has a Meltdown bug and the fix will drop processing power 20%+ in the data center that uses their processors.  So, when the CIO goes to purchase additional systems to make up for this loss, will he buy INTEL (which is the origin of this problem) or AMD (which is not subject to the Meltdown exploit* and costs less in the first place)?This is likely to result in a significantly higher market share for AMD in the data center than is currently reflected in analysts expectations.(*AMD CPUs are subject to the Spectre exploit, but we understand that it's only the Meltdown fix that is expected to significantly slow down processors...)",
"Ok, I read it. Actually decent except for the tone favoring Intel. The author incorrectly seems to think AMD has the more difficult issue to fix and has a more negative attitude to them as a result. Every major chip design has to fix for Spectre! The hit is the same to them all. Intel is the one with the double whammy from Meltdown that will reduce their performance significantly. Why do I bother typing this stuff, everyone here knows it. I'm done...",
"I disagree with your take on Spectre. Tho it may be more difficult to resolve, Meltdown poses a substantially greater risk. And the threat from both is not substantial because both of these Exploits are extremely difficult to implement, from a technical chip processing standpoint - a hacker would need to write exquisitely fast software that knows exactly where to look in transitory memory. So whether or not the event is logged by the device, theres extremely high probability that neither Exploit succeeds in real world. One point I read states that a Spectre Exploit is triggered and processes from within a browser, whereas Meltdown Exploit is at true OS kernel level. This is one reason Meltdown poses greater risk.Also I believe that the kernel level “fix” for Meltdown will have significantly more performance impact than an eventual fix for Spectre. Meltdown workaround must turn over control and management of memory swaps to OS kernel, for what used to be managed at hardware level. Guaranteed to slow down processing. Please read Mark Papermaster, CTO of AMD, at AMD website. He clarifies what vulnerability AMD is susceptible to, what the risk is to AMD chips, and a little about what they are doing to address it. Zen architecture is immune to Meltdown. AMD is the future for Enterprise servers. Corporate computing cannot allow the risk.",
"Looked, people are pissed off and on edge about AMD because of how long its been manipulated. Prior to 2016 when AMD made its initial gains because retail investors saw Zen's potential, it really was in dire straits and deserved a lot of the ire that came its way. That however is no longer the case. AMD has had 2 straight years of beats, improved its top and bottom line, and is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of between 10%-15%. EVERYTHING is on AMD's side right now, yet Wall Street and the CNBC's of the financial world continue to come up with every lame excuse in the book as to why this stock it going to fail.This Meltdown/Spectre debacle is just the latest in lazy or maybe even malicious coverage of AMD. Author I know this was a positive article on AMD, and I thank you for that. I'm going to apologize on behalf of the other commentators for jumping down your throat, but I wanted you and everyone listening to understand where these feelings are coming from. AMD has proven itself at this point, and what should have been the final nail in the coffin (meltdown) asserting AMD's leadership in this market, was twisted and manipulated until AMD was drug down to Intel's level.",
"""AMD will release firmware updates for its processors to protect against the devastating Spectre CPU exploits that affect every modern computer, phone, and tablet. Unlike Intel’s flurry of CPU firmware updates, however, they aren’t being treated as critical must-install patches""The latter from another source is an accurate statement..  AMD CPU architecture is not affected by Meltdown, and the Spectre issues will be much rare and hard to exploit on AMD processors, but will be fixed on newer and older hardware.",

"Wow, a bit out of date.""... but there is currently no solution to cure the Spectre vulnerability. Consequently, AMD has very significant exposure to this issue.""Strangely, both companies are exposed to Spectre... strange you wouldn't mention it here and erroneously give the impression it's an issue specific to AMD.Also, Spectre has already had initial solutions detailed (google retpolines, for example). At the very worst one can make an assumption that the two companies are equal in this regard even though AMD does have advantages here.""The concerns now for AMD are the currently exposed vulnerability of its processors to Spectre and the likelihood that, as with Meltdown, the fix when developed will significantly slow computer and be expensive for the company to implement.""No, it has been seen that expectations concerning Spectre are negligible impact to performance for both AMD and Intel. Neither will the release of OS updates for firmware updates be that expensive for either company.""Yet while Intel is taking the double hit of the impact of both Meltdown and Spectre, AMD has just the one vulnerability to deal with, though it will in probability be the more difficult of the two to solve.""How strange that you seem to try to focus difficulties on AMD with respect to Spectre. I know you do say Intel gets both but when Spectre problems are discussed it is strictly associated with AMD and difficulty. How scary.""Despite the Spectre revelation and because AMD enjoys relative advantage vis-a-vis Intel, the market leader in the CPU space, when considering the totality of both vulnerabilities, I anticipate that AMD's near-term rise will continue.""So, a tiny slice of reality comes in at the end. What's an 85 degree slant piece worth these days?",
"""Q4 earnings may decline by as much as 15% from the level of Q3 as a result of a fall-off in cryptocurrency demand""Huh? The 'fall-off' is the normal seasonal fluctuation vis-a-vis revenues for semi-custom (e.g. Xbox, Playstation) being booked in Q3, as they always are per the holiday build out by OEMs. Has zero zilch nada to do with crypto, which by the AMD's own admission, only represents a mid-single digit percentage of GPU revenues.",

The Q4 decline is purely due to consoles. In fact C&G has their best quarter in Q4. Given how hot GPUs are right now (even hotter than in Q3), it will definitely beat. RX 580s are selling for $500.Can't take anything you write seriously with glaring errors like this.",

"As a previous owner of PLAY shares I know that (as of the 2016 Proxy) approximately 21% of CEO long-term incentive award and 16% of total pay is based on ROIC.  I'm not sure if that is enough to move the needle for shareholders but it is something.  Most restaurants I have looked at do not use ROIC at all.  You also have to worry about them starting with a tough standard and loosening it over the years because management can't hit its targets.I agree with you about operating income and depreciation.  It's definitely a better measure for shareholders than EBITDA (which PLAY also uses) or adjusted measures.  However it is still far too easy to increase operating income by adding new stores.  As long as they are somewhat profitable management will get paid.For restaurants my preference would be for pay to be based on about 50% ROIC (where NOPAT is utilized with no adjustments), 25% SSS and 25% total revenue.  This would encourage management to expand profitably and not just to expand.  Even 1/3 each would be great.",
"Don’t buy a restaurant stock for the long term if management doesn’t have a significant amount of their compensation based on ROIC or economic value added.   The restaurant industry is completely over saturated with stores and most of them continue to expand anyway. Why?  Because compensation is typically based on total sales, operating income growth, EBITDA growth, etc.  All of these are easily achieved by adding less and less profitable stores.  The most serious warning sign is when management decides to buy back franchise restaurants because they cannot meet their growth targets any other way.

All 3 stocks pay dividends and in my will I have set aside money for their education.The purpose is to introduce investing the first one was a  closed end fund that paid monthly and was done so that the could immediately see increases in the value.  The last 2  are quarterly payers and they can view the difference..  At the end of each year i gift them stock directly from my income fund and at that time put that stock on reinvest also for me to help replenish the stock given.  this activity  is updated twice yearly with printed documentation on their birthdays and at Christmas time They also have online access through the broker as I am the custodian..  When they turn 18 the money will be all their with no strings attached to do as they wish.  Hopefully they will use caution with how it is spent through the direction I have provided to them.  If they just blow it as some may do that is also a lesson in how to manage their money as when it is gone it is gone.AlldayAllday,

"People have largely forgotten that there are these Coverdell EDUCATION savings accounts that permit contributions up to $2K annually.  These may be as good or better alternatives for parents and especially grandparents to put aside money for grand children.  Too often people think in terms of the max limit of contributions instead of just setting up these kinds of savings plans early on with smaller allocations.  Of  course many brokers have min balance requirements so you may want to save the first $500 to  $2k over a few years ""under a mattress"" or a safe deposit box with a kid's name on it to get to the start up limit.   Coverdell accounts are for education purposes.  You get no tax deduction but the accounts do accumulate TAX FREE.  If one child does not go to college there are mechanisms to transfer the money to another child's tuition.  There are some good mutual funds to use to participate in some of these sector choices.  One newer one with some promise is the Essential 40 ESSIX, a fund that is expected to also launch as an ETF in 2018.  Other theme standouts are HSFNX for those small cap prosperous regional banks.  JAMFX for tech (FAANG) exposures.  IWIRX  is another with some focus on the so called mega-trends.  Maybe a touch of the GLTR?  Another stealth rally took place recently as PALLADIUM has been the strongest performing commodity in the commodities space and has now surpassed Platinum prices.  With GLTR you can get some exposure to all 4 of the PM majors. The GLTR ETF has put in an 8% gain on it's SAW TOOTH 1 yr chart. There are many Great Mutual funds with ""C"" shares that at first appear to be load funds but which only have exit loads assessed on positions held less than one year.  Investors with the long term purpose of saving for children and grandchildren should likely not be put off by such ""LOADS"" that will expire long before the fund shares are likely cashed out and short enough for providing for re-balancing. ANFCX, PSGCX Small CAP, and  LMOPX mid cap, as examples.With a Coverdell account you can pick and choose individual stocks, ETFs and other lower cost alternatives to some 529 plan straight jacketings.Sure of late indexing via ETFs has been all the rage.  But longer term proven managers as operate the of late out performing O/E mutual funds may have an edge in markets lying ahead with valuations getting so stretched in stocks.  It is just fine for the author to recommend buying individual stocks but since the 2008 stock market meltdown it has become VERY unfashionable to split your shares to get broader market participation.  AMZN now a $1300 stock.  While O/E funds are generally all in all the time it is a lot easier to take something off the table when you can trade commission free as small as a fractional share without giving up your whole position.  You can not always do that with an ETF and DVY for example is now a +$100/share unit.  Some Brokers like the going away Scottrade allowed $100 mins to start mutual funds.  But even if you are facing $2500 mins for mutual fund starts you can usually sell most of the position in 30 to 90 days with no ST trade penalty to find the funds along with recent contributions to start the next fund.  With children you have many years ahead to diversify and re-balance.  Down the road good Mutual fund managers may in the long term by managing from the bottom up on STOCK PICKS  out perform indexing.  In any event for parents and grand parents of more modest means  buying just one share of the author's 10 picks may involve an allocation of well over $2200.  As far as the BRK there is an alternative in the CEF BIF which is 25% BRK.A and 7% BRK.B for participation with a smaller allocation.  THE CEF GGT is also a great idea for media and telecom mega trend participations.  One thing CEFs do that some like or dislike is spin off strong distribution flows out of ROC which is just fine in a bull market as they are just giving you some of the GCG ahead of time.  But in a down market this practice can erode CEF shares very perniciously.  Investors should look at the historical discounts and premiums to NAV in CEFs and try to buy when the discounts are moving towards the 1 year ""high"" measures of discounts to NAV.  Some income from a portfolio is a good place to find some of the capital you want to have on hand when others become fearful. If you are buying a foreign ute especially in a tax sheltered accounts there are many strong GROWTH stories in the Canadian space with favorable tax treaty tax exemptions on distributions.

ARBY's may have the beef but Canada HAS the Green power and is continuing to aggressively grow those platforms.

"Some misunderstand the difference between gambling, speculating and investing. Gambling is a game of chance. No tangible assets are involved. You can win great gain or lose everything on a single round, roll or shot. Speculating involves real assets in some transaction, but without the ability or willingness to assess the value of the underlining asset. Investing assumes you are buying real assets and that you have done due diligence in your assessment of value. The stock market is an auction of real assets of value(assuming they aren't lying) in which you have to do your own due diligence.

It apparently worked.Since the initial investment, The oldest is now driving and recently asked his mom to help him invest in Ford for him and his brother this past year with monies made from his first full time summer job. . He and his brother picked the stock themselves. (I probably would have chosen GM), but they researched and decided Ford all by themselves. Awesome. As a family we educated them at an early age about how adults should use credit cards properly, as well as the importance of balancing a check book, saving for the future etc... Nothing has ever been forced or thrust upon them. The have always been quite well rounded with many interests, learning musical instruments at early ages, active in multiple sports, the youngest is quite the artist. Each have always excelled is STEM  Academic curricula in school. As well each learning through their own interest of the importance of investing and saving at an early age , They each have always volunteered for charitable causes and reach out to help others less fortunate.

After I explained it to them a bit more, they suggested ETSY.  I vetoed it because it didn't seem like there much of a moat and I could see ETSY going bye-bye with next online fad.  What do I know as it has nearly doubled since then.We ended up with 6: Schneider National (soon after it's IPO), Sysco, Okta, Schwab Mid-Cap ETF, Schwab Small-Cap ETF, and a NASDAQ 100 equal weight ETF.",

"Trying to recall how many stocks I was bestowed at the tender age of 10. May I nitpick your choices? KO would never make it because momma didn't want all that sugar and bad stuff in my portfolio. Instead, she places a good slug of SYY, the food delivery outfit. Talk about diversified food!AMZN would have been first to enter my leave alone bunch-o,stocks. Mamma was that good!A real estate investment what? Just too much uncertainty about these. And just how much enthusiasm would a wet-behind-the-ears, although genius child, show for this selection? NO, but rather DIS to answer all my childhood fantasies about something very nice and far away.A bank! Where did you say you are from, son? I am so American that OUR bank would be the way to go on this -- none other than Chase! JPM. Gee, that was simple!Insurance? You've got to be kidding! My father, being the professional medicine man that he was, saw fit to protect his family from calamity by purchasing a term life insurance policy from one of the best rated players -- in commensurate with his fortuitous income. All bases covered!Healthcare is far more than healthcare. It is the ultimate INSURANCE. Here we desire management skill that a long standing and successful mutual fund has had. None other than T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund. 10 year return 15.69 percent handily beats the 500's paultry 9.38. Now, to add even more ""insurance,"" clever as mom was, she knew from her experience as a nursing college graduate that biotechnology held the promise of medicine's new era. She saw fit to throw in some XBI. Nuff said. It just doesn't get any better than this!Defense you say? And defense it is. LMT is a popular one among those of us who know the value of secrets. It should be taught at this anxious corner that our beloved Boeing is an equally loved defense contractor.Oil or Gas? Come on! Currently that rust can is being vehemently kicked down the road (of no return). Hey, we just don't chase the current, albeit short lived revival of fossil fuel stocks at this economic cycle.

It's momma's 8th pick. It's also a club holding and as such, a non mentionable. A utility is such a boring hold in most any portfolio, but the diversification fusion rules. The writer foolishly suggests something in Korea, of all places. We don't want Korean anything, less it be blown off the map! We also don't want boring in any youngster's portfolio, especially being so callously introduced during a Federal interest rate tightening period. Rather, momma, with her head held high, and with a studiously serious attitude, chose an infrastructure fund that handles this quest with far more diversification, yet in keeping with things utilitarian. This, like one other choice is our financial club's quest and is not for public disclosure. Mom never talks about financial matters with anyone outside of family -- she was so quaint! Berkshire? The old man who loves gracing financial pages with his cagey grin is nearing the end of his run. His side kick, Charley is pretty much over the hill too. Momma always said to have them (anything) pay you -- not you them! As such, her pick would be the illustrious Fidelity Low Priced Stock Fund (FLPSX) with a 10-year return of over 10%. You have to love this concept. It yields somewhere south of 2% while Berkshire keeps theirs. At least it's something.See you at the races! Have a good run!",
"Excellent advice.  I started building my now 14-year old daughters portfolio when she was a newborn.  I purchased some of the stocks (or stocks in the industries) that you mentioned for her.  While I often feel that the exercise is not bearing much fruit (as she has little interest in it), every so often she will drop a comment like ""I own them"".   I will add that by enrolling the stocks in dividend reinvestment plans there are two other benefits.  First, the dividend income (subject to a limitation) is essentially tax free and secondly, she gets quarterly statements from the transfer agents that show the growth (hopefully) of her holdings and their value.",
Great article.  We started an account for our daughter before she was born.  She is now 5 and interested in the stocks and learning that she can own stuff like Disney.

"The basic concept of the article is great: teach young kids about investing.Here's a somewhat different approach I took with 3 grandkids a few years ago when they were about 12 (twins) and 13.  Early in the year, after briefing them about the stock market, I asked each to pick out 5 companies whose stock they thought would do well that year.  Of course, they picked stocks like Disney and Apple. I then set up an ""account"" on Yahoo Finance for each child showing 1 share each of their 5 stocks.  I said at the end of the year, I would pay them any profit each made, but they would have to pay me any loss they made (what they did not know was that if there were any loses, I would not collect).  All 3 followed their stocks closely all year in their Yahoo ""accounts"" and fortunately all 3 made a profit, which they were paid on December 31st.  2 of the 3 remain interested in stock investing to this day.",
"Great article Tariq!  Over the years I would say this is one of my favorite Seeking Alpha articles. I wish my parents had foresight enough to teach me some investing fundamentals when I was younger. whether or not people agree on your recommendations or not the premise is there.  Additionally it has been well thought out and explained as a way to give investment exposure across many sectors. I recently opened custodial brokerage accounts for my 1, 3, and 5 year olds to complement their 529 accounts. I was in my 30's before I owned an individual stock outside of an etf or mutual fund. Not the case for them :)",

"I'd stay away from HSBC, they got into a lot of trouble a few years ago for financing terrorism.",
"I agree with everything you have said, and applaud the approach. My only differentiation (as I'm currently doing this with my own three children) is to actually ignore sectors or industries and take a page out of the Peter Lynch / Beardstown Ladies Investment Club playbook (sans the hyped returns) and buy what you are ""familiar with."" I would also tell them to ignore various indices (as that's not how they or I would invest) and simply be a true business owner and shareholder regardless of comparable return (high quality companies tend to get decent returns over time anyway). The return you obtain then, is simply the return for your ""businesses"" you own and the comfort that comes with knowing them well. And the education obtained along the way assigns a premium to the return profile regardless. The company should be well established, large, have a zero, low or maneageable debt level, do business in multiple countries, and preferably pay a dividend (for reinvestment compounding), but most importantly it should strike the interests of the child investor. This is precisely the process I employed as a 12 year, way back when I was first learning about, and embarking on, the journey of investing and bought shares of Quaker Oats (don't ask), which eventually became a part of Pepsi. So, my choices would be: (in no particular order):1) Coca-Cola (or, Monster which is 20% owned by Coke)2) Apple3) Starbucks 4) JM Smucker's 5) Nike 6) Johnson & Johnson7) Microsoft Non dividend payers would include:8) Facebook9) Amazon10) GoogleYou can never start too early, and it's never too late to begin. The point is to help them start their own journey. Great suggestion!",

"Sort of amazing that people criticize you for educating children early.  Go figure.  Since you are in financial planning, I am a little surprised you did not mention the Coverdell Education IRA.   It is a Roth IRA for education.  While the annual contribution is capped at $2,000 per child (and is not tax deductible), the account grows tax free and withdrawals must be for education expenses.  You have complete control over investment decisions so you can pick stocks and you can open the account at any discount broker.  As they get older, and assuming you will teach them about growth investing, the Canslim investing system by William O'Neil is the go to growth investing system--it finished number one in the over 10 year study by the AAII of over sixty different investing systems.

Starbucks is the addictive caffeine/fat/sugar retail brand of the present and future that was Philip Morris, Coke, Pepsi, and McDonald's in the past. Facebook and Google are data mining companies that have all the information in human history while the companies are running predictive analyses on human behavior.

"Starting to invest at age 10 is not a bad idea.  Starting to invest at age 1 is even better.  After all, time in the market is every investor's best friend.Which stocks would I recommend that investors consider buying for their 10 year old children?  Stocks that the children can relate to.  Stocks that the children are familiar with.  McDonald's, Disney, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Hershey, CVS, WBA, 3M, JNJ, Apple.How to get your children interested in doing their own stock market research?  First of all, 10 is a little young.  I did not begin to do my own stock market research until age 14.Who prompted me to begin researching stocks at age 14?  My mother.  She had a subscription to Standard & Poor's.  If my memory is right, it came to the house every month.  I would go through every single stock in Standard & Poor's and underline the ones that had a good earnings growth rate and had a rating of A minus or higher.At age 14 I invested in Mobil, Philip Morris, and Abbott Labs with money that I had saved from my paper route.  In fact, I did my best investing at age 14.  And it was all downhill from there.  That is the reason that I am very interested in the opinions of very young investors.  Their minds have not yet been contaminated with a lot of business school nonsense.Make investment information available to your children.  But never try to force it on them.  I took to investment research like a duck to water at age 14.  But some children may have no interest.  And that's okay.  Let your children be the best of who they are.",

"I'm all for teaching your children about investing and finances as early as possible. 100%.I am inclined to say that I will teach my child about investing via sharing with him/her our family's portfolio, and perhaps allow him/her to start his/her own little mini-folio on the side.However, I can't imagine a 10-year-old reading a 280-page annual report from PetroChina, nor would I fault the child for not wanting to. I would much rather they read The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings, honestly. I believe in value through art, fantasy, and imagination as well. They'll have years and years left to bore themselves to death with financial data and earnings reports, but they only have a few years of innocence and childlike freedom left. I'd let them get lost in Middle-Earth before I'd let them get lost on Wall Street.Sometimes when I listen to James Dimon talk about JP Morgan's last quarter, I reminisce about playing Nintendo as a 10-year-old, unaware of the crap I have to sift through today as an adult.",

It could easily become the IBM of its generation.  Personally I think Google has more strategic growth opportunities.  Of course FANG favorites like Facebook and Netflix would be good, small additions.  Tesla is a good example of how a company with awful financials can ride the cult-love wave.  This might be a good small short position for kids to teach them how companies collapse when they can’t achieve profitability.  Because of Tesla’s very high debt burden and high capex requirements, it has reached the point of no return.  It might survive on life support for a year or two, but I doubt it.  I predict they will seek chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2018.  And then, with a fresh restart, they may be able to deliver on the promise of electric vehicles.",

"Not sure a 10-year old would do as much reading and research as you anticipated? Maybe show them how to access these things as it becomes more interesting for them.. why not invest in a Large Cap ETF and start with discussions on asset allocation and accumulation and understanding companies and industries and then work your way into evaluation fundamental and technical? MGC, VOO, SPY, etc. all great starting points IMO and avoids the risk of just being invested in single stocks across a few sectors. Allows you to discuss adding exposure to these, dollar cost averaging, or adding diversity like emerging or developed markets, etc. etc. It's line with Warren Buffet's advice also that most people would do better in a broad market ETF long term. Seems important to learn about industries, financial tools to invest in (stocks, bonds, reits, etc. etc.) before diving deep into certain company reports which are also largely available? Seems like they'd be at more of an advantage especially if they don't take much of an interest in the market for some time. I do think you offer great points about each industry an the potential research learning opportunities of each.

KO is more for the baby boomer investor, looking for steady, solid yield, with little price fluctuation. Agree with ""Yieldhunter"" on V/MA for a bank as well. The beauty of being 10 is you have a very, very, very long investing time frame. Might as well pick names that can benefit from that the most, not billion dollar conglomerates like KO.Good article.",

"Patrick,I was going to post a comment on my article you read, but then noticed you are still tracking this article. I wanted to convey my appreciation for your courage to challenge status quo assumptions, along with the grace to patiently explain your position to any and all nay sayers. Seeking Alpha would do well with more authors like yourself.AI",
Really. 8% growth not feasible? This company has been around for a long time and has grown a heck of a lot faster than 8% a year. This is not an ambitious growth requirement. What happens in 20 years is not relevant nor fruitful to discuss. What happens in the next 3 to 5 years is what us investors are interested in. Short term the stock may be volatile but there's little doubt that there will be explosive growth over the next several years averaged.,
I'm continuing to buy at these valuations especially when I receive cash dividends from my other stocks. Personally I think the advice in this column holds the same weight as Alex Cho's previous columns. The guy I'd pay attention to is Mark Hibben. At least he has a background in software and hardware and understands Nvidia and its impacts from a deep technological perspective. If you don't understand the technology then how can you predict its impacts. If you haven't delivered code to a customer or dealt with hardware from a programming perspective then you cant really understand the advantages of Nvidia. For instance how many of you have dealt with migrating code from one processor type to another? I've heard of developers taking their code from one Nvidia type processor to a more advanced Nvidia processor without any code breaking. This is huge. Development staffs get speedups in their applications with a hardware upgrade. Developers love this kind of stuff. Nvidia is winning the guerrilla war for the hearts and minds of developers worldwide. Nvidias position is becoming unassailable. Graduating Comp Sci students will be choosing AI jobs based on whether the shop uses Nvidia. Data scientists once trained in Nvidia when they change jobs are going to want to work with a tried and tested technology that takes into account their own legacy methodologies. Nvidia has won the AI wars. It's just an exercise now in counting up the bodies of the opposing forces.,

"The closest I've seen to a non-techie analyst getting it right was Chuck Carnevale in a F.A.S.T. Graphs video dated Aug. 22, 2017.He shows various metrics and concludes that given the profits + cash flow + growth, NVDA's valuation MAY OR MAY NOT be too high. The share price has risen since then but bear in mind NVDA has again shattered earnings expectations since then. Chuck Carnevale left the final conclusion to the viewer.I would strongly suggest you and any one else interested in NVDA's valuation watch the entire video; it's only 10:44 in length.Chuck Carnevale goes into a far more comprehensive analysis of NVDA's valuation than you do in this article.If one is going to try to value NVDA by standard stock metrics (instead of adding an in-depth business analysis), this is by far the best presentation I have seen by an author who writes on SA.http://bit.ly/2r36KDX",

"GPUs lose money mining bitcoin because of the cost of hardware and electricity burn. The mining would be a perpetual money loser. 2/3 of bitcoin mining is done in China (cheap coal fired electricity) using custom ASICs. That may change with Volta but I doubt it since ASICS are customized to optimize specific functions where GPUs are chips originally designed for graphics. Alt coins can still be profitably mined with a GPU, but if one gets uber popular it will become uneconomic to mine if an ASIC is designed to optimize crunching that coin's algorithm. Anyone wanting to start mining today with fresh GPU based mining rigs will have to pay a premium for limited quantities. Inflated grey market pricing makes alt coin mining less appealing because of the pushed out time to breakeven.",
Isn’t Bitcoin mining driving revenue?  We’ll see at earnings.,
"Hey everyone,I am new to the NVDA community and could use some assistance to understand a curious situation. I have been a tech entrepreneur since 2001. One of my businesses is a top 500 (in NA) Intel Technology Provider. We are significant demand generators for Intel, Micron and NVDA.We have endured a tripling of memory prices over the last three years and suffered months during 2017 being unable to source all the NAND we needed. Now that memory and NAND is getting better, we find ourselves in the worst high end video card shortage I have ever seen. We specialize in high end engineering and financial quant workstations. The engineering workstations use NVDA based Quadro cards which can run in the thousands of dollars for just the card. The financial quant workstations use inexpensive multi display cards. We typically do a much smaller volume of gaming workstations as our business model is primarily B to B. Quadro availability is tight but its a balanced supply/demand ratio so no deals for quantity. So the issue is we have never had a problem getting what we wanted in the GTX1050 to GTX1080 space until recently. We are working on a project involving hundreds of GTX 1080 and there is literally nothing. We are being told months of waiting are going to be the norm for awhile. ASUS, EVGA, PNY all nothing. We reached out to PNY, who we buy from the most because they have an exclusive on the NVDA Quadro line. We like the quality and support on all PNY cards so we stay with them as much as possible. PNY is telling us they are not experiencing any sourcing issues on anything, including NVDA GPUs, EXCEPT GDDR5 memory. So the shortage of GDDR5 memory is severe enough to hold up months worth of NVDA based video card production??? The other factor they mentioned was China gamers (Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds was mentioned) are soaking up production because it is easier to sell out at higher prices without bothering with international logistics, export/import, customs, letters of credit, etc.Would appreciate anyone's further insight as to what is going on. In exchange, my contribution is this: If high end (and highest margin/revenue) NVDA GPU sales are brisk, but they are piling up at the card manufacturers inventory because they can not be matched up with sufficient memory, this will have to eventually negatively impact NVDA. They could report record sales but if it ends up being revealed it all channel stuffing, the stock is going to take a hit. I am not long or short NVDA owner as I try to avoid tech stocks because I don't need the extra exposure.",
"Gaming is the largest segment.  AMD has graphic cards which have similar price performance in the mainstream segment.  The monitor support for AMD is much better with Freesync monitors about $200 less than Gsync and a wider selection.  NV has no interest in supporting Freesync.  So the mainstream or value gaming market seems somewhat at risk.  The GPU demand for bitcoin mining is another big driver which looks risky as hell.  So I agree with the author, that valuation deters me, have to study for a long time to invest in it.  Incredible run in the stock though.",
"At the end of the day, it boils down to one very simple fact: Wall Street is not a charity. A stock like NVDA where anyone who's anyone knows it has explosive long term growth potential is not going to be cheap. An investor can either accept that and own it, or pass it up.Very long NVDA.",

"Patrick, I suggest you read a bit more about the ""tectonic"" shift that's going on in data centers regarding the transition from CPU to GPU (http://bit.ly/2jsSYYd).

Who in your opinion is going to come out with a competitive GPU for data center, autonomous driving, high end E-sports? who has the patents? And please, if you want to maintain any form of credibility, please don't say AMD. Esports hasn't seen anything yet, this is just taking off. When I went through the comments, it seems to suggest that your article isn't bringing much new to the table of discussion. Those of us that have held NVDA for years have heard the same old song and dance. My cost average is $60, if NVDA drops a few 20 or 30 points I don't really care. Its the long game that I'm playing..

"Patrick,Would you have voiced similar cautions about today's tech giants when they were at similar stages in their growth? (not talking about 1999ish as the entire picture was different then). If so then you're at least consistent.Do you know enough about Nvidia to see how it is very well-positioned on a trajectory to become a tech mega-cap itself? I'm not talking about momentum but rather fundamental business forces.Do you read much about AI and the profound changes it is starting to make and how the world will be transformed, like the great revolutions transformed the world (agricultural, industrial, electronic, telecom, computer/PC/smartphone).Within 10 to 30 years, MOST jobs will be done by AI-imbued robots, not humans. Most programmers, most financial analysts, and even most CEOs will be replaced by AI. Not to mention tradespersons being replaced by robots.The fact is that machines will be able to do nearly every work-related thing humans can do, but better and more cheaply.I forget if it was Jack Ma or Masayoshi Son who stated this: By the year 2030, the top CEO in the world will not be a human.Something to ponder. Don't take my word for it, though. Ask Billl Gates, Larry Page, Masayoshi Son, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk what they think the future world will look like. They won't agree on everything but they will all agree it will loook immensely different than today, and that it's coming very fast.",

But in my opinion this would've been a much more informative article if you'd had a significantly longer section examining all the cheaper alternatives to Nvidia that you rely on so much to prove your thesis.  It feels like you're leaving out half the argument.  You say that the better options of tapping the same growth trends are far less obvious.  Well, all the more reason for you to tell us in detail what they are.  In particular, since what appeals to people about Nvidia is that it's at the nexus of all these trends, to give a true alternative I think you should propose other companies that profit from all of them, or at least several.  It makes sense that a company that benefits from multiple growing markets deserves a higher valuation than one that benefits from only one.",

That’s about where it should be given that the hyper growth will not continue.

"Before I disagree with the author, I will say that shareholders have an immensely optimistic regard of the company at this time, which the author is making as a counter statement.  I disagreed with the statement of the demand for GPUs, but I am more concerned regarding other competitors getting a piece of the GPU.  AMD is closest competitor, but it is such a lucrative business, so there will likely be others wanting in.  Intel may even partner up with AMD for using AMD's ATI to take on NVDA.  Last, but not least, there are always overseas threats although hopefully not as likely.  So, at current price, Intel and AMD have to continue to be less than frienemies, AMD has to be unable to increase its market share, and overseas competitors cannot wiggle into the market.  If any of these events take place, the author is right and NVDA will have a small set back and the share price will plummet significantly.  People who got it way back will obviously be more sheltered than recent buyers.Now that I say this, I think that won't happen, but I am long AMD and NVDA.  AMD is underpriced for its potential to enter and be a GPU player, and NVDA because it is an amazing company, and I don't think those events will take place soon.",

"I have bought and sold CTRP many times and made some good money.  I have visited the HQ and liked what I saw, nice office environment, friendly people, etc.  I liked their products and bought some air tickets as well as tour packages out of Shanghai from them.  All are top notch.  One reason I don't want to hold it for long term now is simple:  almost every quarter, their gross margin is good but GAAP net income is not so good mainly due to huge amount of options/shares they grant to employees (my guess is the bulk went to executives) to the point that net income is halved by this line item on good quarters and more than halved in a not so good quarter.  They have to be more serious with this non-cash compensation because it is real money from shareholders. In summary, they have been overly generous to employees (again, with the bulk of the benefits going to top management) at the expense of shareholders.  I do not mind employees sharing profits but not to the extent of over 50% of net income (before this non-cash compensation).  For 2016 Revenues = 19,228M, GP = 14,499M, Share based comp = 3,561M, Net Income = (1,431M), a loss mainly due to the SBC! where M= Million Yuan.Note: Net Income before Share based comp = at least 2,130M (ignoring tax impact) and they paid 3,561M in SBC, that's huge by any standard.  I have noted this type of situation for US listed companies once before and the CEO was ousted shortly after the result in that case. Also: The SBC does not seem to be linked to performance based on the financials available.Checked 2017 nine months' result, EPS was 1.06yuan but without SBC EPS was 2.99, share based comp was two times larger than final net income per share, i.e, shareholders got 1.09 yuan per share in retained earnings while employees got extra 1.93 yuan per each share in SBC which is in addition to their salaries and benefits.Once they fixed this, I would gladly hold CTRP as a core long term holding as it is at the right place with the right product/market/strategy and the right people, everything great except that one line item.",

"If investment decision just rely on these superficial analysis, it is going to fail!  For Ctrip, pls think hard why after more than 10 years, the competition is still so intense!  Think about why Qunar had almost killed Ctrip!  The industry is not so good as it looks. When you talk about a lucrative industry, never overlook the threats of endless new entrants. Today, Ctrip's competitors just get bigger, like Alibaba, Meituan. The industry economics is changing. Airlines are cutting commissions, and chain hotels grow much faster, like Hanting. Priceline enjoy its near-monopoly position in Europe, but can Ctrip enjoy the same in China? Certainly not! Chinese entrepreneurs are very innovative and aggressive. Ctrip's moat is not strong enough to defeat invaders. Jane Sun's background is accounting, her strategic ability remains to prove yet. Will International M&A be its first priority? Perhaps not. Domestic market is already a huge market for Ctrip. If it can crush its competition, its market cap will certainly go up. Ctrip need to develop more edges to win over end users. So far, I am not convinced. For example, I had booked hotels in China several times via booking.com instead of Ctrip, since booking.com can offer cheaper prices. Ctrip seems to have pricing power due to huge memberships, but in reality its price is not so competitive!  In terms of innovation, not much impressive. Having spent billions of dollars, what kind of benefits Ctrip offered to its consumers?  High prices and default add-on optional items tricks? That's not good.I will only consider Ctrip a serious investment when it can demonstrate its ability to improve its stickiness, reputation and competitive advantage over Meituan and Alibaba（Fliggy）. Ctrip has been marketing aggressively recently. It remains the first choice for many to book online traveling. It has rich service offerings which can meet every traveler's need.  It has extensive supplier networks and sophisticated offline service operations. These are what make its business so prosperous. Meituan is still in its early stage, and Alibaba has much power in term of its vast eco-system. But Users can't install three OTA apps on their smartphones.  Ctrip need to work hard to let users install and keep its app as their first choice. Customer service need to improve a lot. Customer engagement need to strengthen.Its a dirty job for OTA. How to streamline its operation and make every happy in the eco-system is a tough task. So there is much to be confirmed before Ctrip's financial results can really take off.",

"Besides the problems other comments mention above (dilution, CEO is not founder, etc) one key difference in Priceline vs Ctrip is that Priceline has a very profitable European Hotel operation.  Europe is dominated by small independent hotels that has to rely on Priceline to market their hotel.  Priceline US operation is quite less profitable than European operation. In China there's more hotel chains that has more resources to do independent marketing.   Large hotel chains are increasingly adopting Airline's model to do direct customer sales through price search engines. I would expect Ctrip's hotel operation will never be as profitable as Priceline's. Furthermore there's constant competition threat.  Ctrip diluted heavily to kill Qunar competition.  When investors think Ctrip finally would dominate the market after Qunar deal, new competition from Alitrip and Meituan pops up again.  High revenue growth does not translate to high profit growth.  Valuation is not cheap compare to other internet play with a solid growth profile and far less competition.  Oh, I forget to mention uncertainty around its bundle sale practice that is yet to reflected in next few quarters.",
"You do not mention the huge share dilution that has occurred in recent years with ever continuing share issuance. This must put a brake on EPS.

"This is not a company worth investing in, leaving alone hoping it to be a multibagger. This sector is thriving indeed, however, it's not to be enjoyed by CTRP.1.

Replacing James Liang, founder of Ctrip, she literally stopped CTRP from strategic advancement. If you are familiar with CTRP's history, they were very aggressive at building up market share through cooperation and pricing wars.2.

I'm not sure if that's visionary or short-sighted. To sum up, Ctrip sounds like a very good growth story while in fact, it's old and deteriorating inside.

excellent analysis with a very clear methodology and well argued thesis. thank you for sharing. the company leadership is also involved in a listed cobalt project in Australia called Clean Teq Holdings. i wonder whether you have any views on that.,

"Should add a couple of other notes:Think the real target are the cobalt minersWhen IVN and Zijin signed the agreement with the DRC in November 20016, they increased the DRC ownership to 20% in K&K from 5%. The increased share for the DRC would be paid through royalties. So, the pain of the increase royalty to 3.5% will be in the future",

"Talmage, thanks for the excellent article. I'm new to mining stocks but certainly intrigued by this company. My question for you is about location and value. If these mines were located in a better locale the value of this company would certainly be much higher, closer to the $12.5 bil as you suggest. Given the reality of the situation and ongoing uncertainty of the stability of the DRC, the value is much less. Would there ever be a time where the value of the company approaches a fair value given the risks? Say in 5-6 years they are producing x amount of dollars in rev, there would still be a substantial risk due to the instability of the regions. Do you think they would sell these assets at some point? I appreciate any additional insight you might have.",
EXCELLENT.,
"If there's anything that could be added to this it is that the copper concentrate produced at Kamoa/Kakula is expected to be highly ""clean"" as in free of contaminants such as arsenic and antimony and therefore will command a premium over spot. Clean concentrate is desirable as it can be blended with less clean concentrate so that the less clean stuff will meet smelter standards such as those in China. I wouldn't know how to quantify that premium nor how to factor it into a valuation but it will be undoubtedly significant especially in the aggregate over 44 years of a mine life.",

"I notice that the author has not replied to any of the commentary. I too have expressed gratitude for the excellent article  and also would like to hear from him regarding the details surrounding the ownership. I understand that each of Ivanhoe's project are set up as separates corporations with different partners at each project. Platreef (Itoshu 10%, Black empowerment (26%) with Ivanhoe having the balance in a joint venture company (Ivanplats). Komoa/Kakula(-Kamoa Mines with the shareholders being Ivanhoe and Zijin at 39.5% each with the DRC having 20% with Crystal River having 1%). For the Kipushi project the partners are Ivanhoe and  Gecamines  in a separate venture with Ivanhoe holding 68% and GECAMINES having the balance). I understand that there are contractual limitations on the use of the old Kipushi treatment plant and would like to know how this problem will be resolved because toll milling would seem to reduce the capex compared to a new concentrator to treat the high copper ores that will be mined during the operation. There is also no clarification that I have seen as to how the pre operational capex is being split-Is Ivanhoe loaning the money to GECAMINES or is the DRC ponying up the development costs as they are being incurred?.These comments are not in any way a reflection on the published article and analysis as they are strictly relevant to specific Ivanhoe projects where the article discusses the evaluation methodology for evaluating a developer and explorer company and uses Ivanhoe as an example and makes an excellent case for Ivanhoe's share price to be much higher..",

Anyone investing in companies operating in the DRC needs to proceeds with extreme care. I lived there for over 3 years and worked with many  mines of listed companies that had amazing potential. Very few of them exist anymore. Shareholders have lost 100%  of their investment.,

For my longs this is first place on top of PLUUF.  I must say that the first time I read Kipushi resource grades of 42% zinc equivalent I thought it was a type O and I did some more looking to verify it.  Numbers like that on a cheap mine stock sends red flags up for me, the old if it is to good to be true.  Two questiosn for you is with Zijin providing a large percentage of the money do they have a owner/stock percentage in this or some milestone payments or anything of the sorts?   Is the governments profit percentage an or tax amount carved is stone yet?",
Never before have read an article with this depth.of analysis and understanding of the risk-reward inherent in mining. There is an assumption that Ivanhoe will proceed to production and reap the benefit of the long life assets that have been assembled to date but by looking back at the prior incarnation of IVN there is a good chance that the company or one or more of the projects will be acquired at a reasonable premium ( a lot higher than the current market value).I am on board and await the inevitable increase in the market cap of the company.t,

"An outstanding report.One premise here is an argument for a discount rate around 5%.   Even if some may think this on the low side,  I agree with this rate.  The discount rate is partially about compensating for expected inflation.  In the case of mining, however, there is an automatic inflation compensation that's built in.  Over the long haul, metal prices rise with inflation.  So you need less discount rate for an investment that is returning pounds of metal than you do for an investment that is returning inflating dollars.  Taken over the past 30 years inflation has halved the value of a dollar; that representing about 3% per annum on average.  Examining metal prices over a comparable period, you see a compensating doubling, albeit with plenty of fluctuation in there and variation from metal to metal.   My bottom line is that you effectively need 3% less discount rate in consideration of a mining investment to the extent that the underlying commodity is treated at it's current value.",
Very well done.  Thanks,

Not considered is the Ebay 10% fee on shipping - hurts much on under $10 sales with $4 to $7 shipping the fee is actually 14% to 17% plus Paypal 6% (30¢+ 2.9%).

"After the recent acquisition of Primero por AG I asked myself if it is worth to buy some AG shares. I have looked at some presentations and I have made some numbers, but I have been left with some doubts that I have not been able to answer.1.

Mr. Neumeyer blames the situation on work stoppages and strength of the Mexican Peso.2. San Dimas production:	2015 150K oz Au + 7,5M oz Ag AISC 755	2016 100K oz Au + 5,5M oz Ag AISC 1125	2017 75K oz Au + 4,5M oz Ag AISC 1050In both cases we have the same problem, declining production and increased costs. In the Primeros presentation of 2015 estimated that the production in 2017 would be 215K Au eq (Those wonderful years).The questions that arise are the following:1. Will Neumeyer and his team reverse the San Dimas situation if they have not been able to change the AG trend?2. I think San Dimas is a good asset, but it is an old mine and requires capex. How much money will be necessary to have an operation similar to the one estimated in 2015 (if it is possible)? $ 10 M, $ 50M, $ 100M ...?3. The Mexican government claims about $ 100 M to Primero (now AG), what is the probability that they will reach an agreement to lower that amount?Conclusion:From my point of view, the cost of the acquisition can range between $ 320 M and $ 470 M ($ 320 M + $ 100 M + $ 50 M capex). I think AG needed to buy something and San Dimas is a good option, but it has a high risk, and for an investor a high risk requires a margin of safety in the price. I would like to buy AG shares, but only if the price is right, and I think $ 6.80 is to take a lot of risk.",

AG DOWN 2.58% on a day when silver pops UP over 2%. This makes no sense to me. How does one reasonably explain a 4.5% spread like that?,
"I think it was a good deal for AG, keep in mind it was P and WPM who were desperate to get this deal done.Reserves: 77,410,000 silver equivalent ounces (70ag:1au)Resources: 133,652,000 silver equivalent ounces (70ag:1au)WPM gets 25% of Gold/Silver for $600 per Gold equivalent ounce (70:1).Reduced 2017 guidance to 75 to 85koz AuEq with AISC of $1,050 to $1,150/oz Au.Keep sin mind, AG will have AISC well below this amount. Gold grade is 4g/t and Silver grade is 322g/t.  So assuming with this low production (I think will be higher), take 25% off for WPM, then you have 63,000 AuEq per year.  I would expect AISC to be no more than 900. So you have free cash flow of $27,090,000 (say Gold at $1330).So they pay $320M for this, not a steal but still a good deal.http://bit.ly/2FsX350 (page 19)",

Cannot understand the deal. Ag paid how much? For how much reserve?,
At first glance it does seem AG overpaid for this transaction since Mux basically stole Black Fox from Primero and received a much better deal. This deal isn't even as good as AG taking over Santa Elena from Silvercrest. The amount of equity used just to restructure the stream is ridiculous. Hope this is a win-win transaction since I'm equally weighted in both WPM and AG.,

"The stock is providing one hell of a buying opportunity. In hindsight professional investing 101 is to not own companies that are in big capital spending growth mode. By definition they spend a lot of money which hits all the profitability metrics because they are building capacity but unable to realize the sales and profits of whats being built until its done being built. Then once its built the exact opposite phenomenon happens where the spending slows a lot and they start to realize the fruits of selling more stuff, in this case students, and the profitability metrics snap back and go higher then they were before the spend cycle. Well, now we are at the cusp of that harvest inflection point and when that shows up the stock won't be sitting there. In reality these guys could and should be spending as much money as they can for growth because there is that much opportunity for them but because the stock isn't working the Market is telling them to balance that spend for growth with showing profitability and the CEO and BOD heard that loud and clear and really have not other choice then listening because they aren't going to issue new stock and dilute the shares anywhere near the current stock price nor should they. The drop down of profits to the EBITDA line seen on the incremental revenue growth just proves out the model and my rational above.This horse is at the gate and the starting gun is going to go off sometime in 2019.",
Would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this quarter's revenue.,
"USU added 223 new students in Q1. If they exit Q4 at a 400 new student enrollment run rate at an average ARPU of roughly $18K or $9K per year that equates to $3,600,000 in new revenue per year. USU already has over 600 students through Q1 so they should end the year with well over 1000 students. If they add 400 in Q4 and add conservatively 1600 new students (assumes zero sequential growth in 2020) then they would have over 2000 students at USU exiting 2020.USU should do $10-12m in revenue in FY2020 revenue next year, which is 125%-150% growth from FY19 expectations (current) and reach profitability in a couple quarters.Patience should be rewarded here over next few quarters.",

One of the few high growth stocks without a rich multiple. Think this may get a little cheaper until they print Q2, but could snap back hard once burn concerns are no longer feared by market. Core Aspen U business is now generating cash flow.What's impressive is that company is generating a profit on students by their 3rd class despite industry low ARPU and ARPU should trend higher overtime as company's new CRM system goes live and further improves retention/persistency.I'm interested to see the USU Q2 numbers.

"it looks great but patience is required. Investing 101 says its hard to see a stock go up materially while in a big capital investment more because you are always mismatched with a big spend/investment with out the corresponding revenue so the income statement margins always are under pressure. Thereafter everything then goes the other way for the better because you see very good revenue growth and the big capital spending program moderates so margins and profitability expand meaningfully which is what will happened with ASPU. If you only own a little bit of stock (under 25,000) shares you can probably try to be more timely and wait but ion you want/need to own a sizable position then now is when you need to be accumulating the shares.

This seems like a different business model which is much harder to scale than the online model.",
Because some people are VERY SLOW,
"No. It will be a progressive ramp. USU new enrollments:Q3 103Q4 177Q1FY19: my estimate is 225 and this is seasonally slowest summer qtrQ2FY19: my estimate 350Q3FY19: 400Q4FY19: 450Run rate heading into FY2020 should be 450 which gets you to 2000 plus new gross enrollments in 2020.What people are also missing is that every student that USU enrolls has more than 2x the ARPU or LTV than the core Aspen students which have a $7500 LTV.So, revenue numbers are definitely on track.",
Did everyone else expect bigger enrollment numbers? have they started the increase in ad spend yet?,
Russell2000 additions on the Russell website- will be added to the Microcap IndexYou can now buy Aspen for 3.3x CY revenue with 80% growth or you can buy PluralSite for 29% growth traded at 15x revenue. Liquidity isn't worth that type of premium.,
Russell 2000 - where do you see this happening? Revenue growth...no doubt!,
Being added to the Russell 2000 should be a near term catalyst and solid acceleration in revenue growth should be a momentum accelerator when Q4 results come out in 3 weeks.,
From your mouth to god's ears.Positioned and ready for take off!,
at today's prices you are getting USU and pre-licensure businesses for free. 3 years out USU is a $40m revenue business and Pre-licensure is $12-$15m per each campus at scale and there is no reason they can't have 5-10 campuses within 5 years.I think when new enrollments are up close to 100% sequnetially this quarter investors will begin to take notice. This stock is set up for a big move over the next 24 months,
The number look great! The upfront sending to build out USU and the physical college in Arizona have great return profiles addressing huge unmet market needs and attracting new students at a very low cost of acquisition is what they excel at. The economics of the advanced nursing degree being offered at USU has a $15K+ Gross Profit per student outcome which is 2X that of Aspen's online nursing degree. They both have a 5:1 return on capital outcome but the cost of getting and delivering the advanced degree is 2X. The advanced degree students incomes will jump up to $125k+ after 2 years and there is a very large demand for them. This is going to be  a great investment for many many years to come although it may bounce around in here for the time being but that is your opportunity.,
"What do folks thing about the quarterly results?  Seems like a mixed bag, top line growth is strong but in the short term will need to spend to build out the sales force.",
"Yes for sure but not anytime soon, way too much upside staying independent for the CEO/founder.",
"Anyone think theres a chance ASPU will be bought out? If their business model truly cannot be replicated by a competitor, why wouldn’t one of these big for-profits just buy them?",
Did anyone see the press release about a “material announcement” on Monday?,
These guys are trading at 1.8-1.9x sales on calendar yr 19 numbers for 80 percent growth. Are there any other stocks you know of with that growth for that valuation? Please post if you do.,
The numbers were astounding. LTV continues to increase. Their CAC to LTV is 8x and their going to grow revenue 80 percent this next year and their only spending 25 percent of revenue on sales and marketing. Netflix is growing 18 percent with a CAC to LTV of less than 4. There’s not a direct to consumer company on the planet that has a CAC to LTV of 8x. Dollar Shave club was acquired for 7x and their CAC to LTV was maybe 5x.,
"Craig Hallum initiated today with a buy and $12 target ST and $25-45 LT. A $12 price target with a path to well over $20. While our initial pricetarget is $12 (~15x FY2020E EBITDA discounted back at 20%), we believeASPU’s value proposition could boost their student population to 30,000-50,000 which, using a similar valuation approach could produce a $25-$45stock (see page 8).Aspen Group CompetitorsASPU Acquisition Costs ~$800 VS.~$4,000 - $5,000ASPU Avg.

You have the story!I thought after last qtr the stock could take a breather because of the fact that it has been a incredible returning equity and we have a lot of moving pieces namely the investment in staff and related for the recently acquires USU. Admittedly i thought the stock would be dead money for a quarter but not tradeoff as much as it has but thats just transient and opportunity in my opinion.,
"Someone please help me get past the ""too good to be true"" objection. I've added a few thousand shares during the dip but have the ability but I can still buy more. 1) ASPU makes 9x return (revenue) on every marketing dollar.2) Ad spend will increase to $650,000 per month beginning May. 3) Which means ASPU will add $5,750,000 to revenue backlog every month ($70 million on an annual basis).4) ASPU will add new degree programs soon. And if the returns are remotely close to ROI from nursing programs, the runway (TAM) is significant.The investment thesis just seems too good to be true.Is there any other high margin business that is making 9x return on every dollar invested?",
Great CEO and a clear path to a couple hundred million in revenue with a disruptive pay as you go business model.,
"Good stuff. Some other insight...The acquisition of United States University is transformational for Aspen as it gives the company regional accreditation, significantly expands the TAM and allows it to offer far more degree categories.It is great to see innovation in the higher education industry that allows more students to be able to achieve degrees at an affordable cost.",
"I've looked for the following quote by CEO Michael Matthews (which you reference was on the Q2 call on Dec 13th): “So, if we were to do a little simple math and assume by the end of 2018 that the company had 100 call center reps and the average rep was adding 10 students a month and the average lifetime tuition value of a student was $10,000, the company would be signing up students with a lifetime value of revenue of $120,000,000."" Can you provide a link. Thanks.",
"i've owned for 3 years and i also keep buying it including adding 20,000 shares on Friday. The risk:reward is very attractive and the upside is tremendous. Like i said, the fact that the valuation is still attratcive despite the stock appreciation is an anomaly that won't last much longer.",
"Bought in 18mo ago, lucky timing. ASPU is my largest holding and there are few investments in the market with huge upside to very little downside risk. Great article. I’ve been silent on ASPU because I’ve been buying it. Sooner or later the word will get out, until then I’ll be buying as much as possible.",
"It's taken so long because he built Aspen from scratch and first needed the degree accreditations, one can't simply juts start granting degree's. The company was at its infancy and needed to hone it's skill sets (student acquisitions and classes/teachers) so the needed to walk before running. The company was also capital starved needed to prove out the business model which it has done amazingly. That student acquisition cost is amazing and the key to the whole story in addition to the low cost of the on-line degree(s). Mathew's is the real deal and the story is in the very early innings here. The fact that the valuation is still attractive is remarkable. Opportunity is knocking, i suggest you take advantage of it!",
"@BigDealThis is probably one of the most interesting ideas I've come across over the past 3 months.  Now I'm probably going to be looking into this to a high degree, but Mathews has been at the helm since 2011.  The business model seems valid considering the need for lower cost education.  The state schools just aren't cutting it with prices spiraling out of control.  I guess my question is why has this company just started to come out of the gate just recently?  Why has it taken so long to gain traction?  I understand for-profit education had come under fire in recent years but is that really it or have their been major hiccups along the way for Aspen?",
"Agreed, thank you for the great read. I can’t wait until ASPU gets more attention. I’ve been a shareholder since 2015 and will continue to hold!",
"Awesome write up and read.  I have been vested in ASPEN over eight years prior to Mike coming on board.  Since taking over the university, he has delivered on every plan presented to the shareholders.  You are spot on with the growth potential over the next several years.  The team in place will get it done.  Not even mentioning that the purchase of United States University last quarter will also add significant revenue to the bottom line in a short amount of time.  That is not even mentioned here.  The sky is the limit on sales growth...and keep in mind he is changing the world by providing students the option for a ""debt free"" life upon graduation!!!

"Hi Zach, nice summary!Based on Wikipedia, geographic atrophy (GA) and wet AMD are both advanced forms of AMD, but they are different diseases:“GA, also known as advanced dry AMD, is an advanced form of AMD that can result in the progressive and irreversible loss of retina, which can lead to a loss of visual function over time. It is estimated that GA affects approximately 1 million patients in the US, which is similar to the prevalence of wet AMD, the other advanced form of the disease.”Below is an excerpt from an old report by Cowen:“Roughly 85-90% of patients have the dry form of AMD. Up to 15% of AMD patients have the wet form, which can involve bleeding within and beneath the retina, opaque deposits, and, eventually, scar tissue. The wet form accounts for 90% of all cases of legal blindness in macular degeneration patients.The dry form of AMD features slowly progressive, degenerative changes in the retinal pigment epithelial cells, Bruchs membrane, and the choroid. Many people can go for a long time with the dry form and not experience any vision problems, and when vision eventually deteriorates, it occurs gradually in the absence of wet AMD lesions. Only about 25% of people reach the stage of severe vision loss with only the dry form of AMD.”If the Cowen's report is correct, it is the wet AMD, not GA, that more likely lead to blindness.Your fellow author at SA, Healthcare Explorer, wrote two articles before and after yours. His key argument against Apellis' technology is: The conversion rate from GA to wet AMD in the APL-2 treated eyes were significantly higher than sham. Since wet AMD tends to lead to blindness, the treatment of Apellis' candidate may actually cause some of the GA patients develop another more severe disease, wet AMD. If this is true, it is totally against the medical community motto: ""Do no harm!""From Apellis' own January 2018 deck (Slide 16), it shows that the placebo group has only 1% wet AMD conversion rate, whereas for the two treatment arms, the rates are 8% (injection every other month) and 18% (injection monthly). No wonder the author Healthcare Explorer cried loud after he/she saw the slide deck by saying: ""Apellis is pivoting to the message that converting to wet AMD is a good thing since the dry progression slows down"".In addition, in the same deck (Slide 9), Apellis states that up to 98% of wet AMD patients progress to GA. Here, Apellis is saying that GA is a more severe form of wet AMD!Right now I tend to agree with Healthcare Explorer.

However, to think this Andrew guy would openly in public stated that he would send his trashy accusation to the government and expected an investigation by the enforcing branch  seem to be extreme, if indeed the government takes action based on his accusation.  As an investor in many small biotech cos, I saw the abuses in the past FDA officers engaged in to deny many promising drugs by setting up Adcom review meetings chaired by “expert” who was paid as consultant by  competitors with drugs being challenged.  This kind of thing did happen as I see it.  Fortunately now FDA has a new Commissioner with the expressed interest to quicken the approval process of drugs with clear safety and efficacy.",

Adjusting for this one time charge the PE ratio moves down to around 30x.If you then look at next years earnings and assume EPS of 41 then the PE moves down to around 27x. I believe EPS of 41 is a reasonable but fairly conservative estimate. Then if you adjust for cash (say 100B net cash) then the PE falls even further.. about another 12%. So we arrive at a PE ratio around 24x. Google has a giant moat, it is growing at quick rates, it holds several leadership positions in future industries. To me Google looks downright attractive as an investment. Especially when you consider that the numbers I used are likely conservative, the effects of the tax plan, and that the market as a whole pretty pricey by comparison. I certainly wouldn't consider selling Google and I think that it's perfectly reasonable to add to the position at  this moment.",

Mark Zuckerberg is doing exactly what he should be- proactively anticipating ways in which to both improve the service and counter detractors- especially those within governments worldwide. These actions will have a positive long term impact and are subject to managements modifications if they fail to achieve their desired effect. FB is set to release their most recent quarterly results at the end of this month. They will likely have top and bottom line growth exceeding 40%. The bottom line may greatly exceed this matrix.

I feel that he gets a lot of pressure of people like Elon Musk, who do the same kind of things, but have more backing on moral grounds.It is both in his interest as a person and long-term as a business, to take the dip now and make a business that both makes people live's actually better (instead of pushing them into depression or further into depression) and improves the perception of what is Facebook to them.

Bought myself in September at 145 when some cash came in from a sale. If it comes back again probably worth an add. People with high book costs should be out by now - plenty of profits to offset losses in 2017. This should reduce resistance to a big upside move whenever this comes.

"Great article - I'm a follower now. why do you think does this opportunity exist? I still don't get it. And why do you think the valuation gap will ever close? The market cap of Softbank's Alibaba shares is greater than SoftBank's market cap. But this is not a secret. If I'm not mistaken there have been countless articles pointing that out for at least two years now. Is it the debt burden? In this case I'd argue that net debt will be reduced going forward. Thanks to the vision fund. They could sell their Alibaba shares and instantly pay down all the debt. This shouldn't be an issue.Tax ? Yes, they would have to pay capital-gain taxes but this doesn't explain  the huge gap. Is it the management style? Wall Street doesn't love people that invest for the long-Term and don't care about short-term profits. Maybe people are cautious because of the sprint acquisition. Committed Capital as of Sep 30 2017 was almost $100bn. Total committed capital as of May 2017 was $93bn. Share price has increased by merely 11.15% since May 2017.... although softBank gets most of the upside and a recurring management fee + they don't have to take on more debt to do the acquisitions, which will allow them to reduce the amount on the BS going forward.

"Couple things: biggie is that Incyte today is not the company founded 25 years ago.  That was a human gene licensing company.  About 10 years ago there was what amounted to an internal reverse-takeover and today's drug development company appeared.  So it took about 5 years for THAT company to get a drug to market.Other thing is that interest rates are critical in valuing a company that promises cash payouts far in the future.  With the 10-year Treasury rate at around 2.5% and generally resisting political pressure to get rates higher, future cash is more valuable than in the assumed ""typical"" situation (4-5% Treasury yield)Possible minor catalyst: at the recent JP Morgan conference, Lilly teased us with a graph of Olumiant sales in Germany.

At the last two tops of 22, all the brass sold at that price.  So far no notices have come of sales at the over 22 price stock hit after JPM Presentation, a good sign.  Technically the stock broke above the recent high of 22.30 but could not hold it and sank below that price level.  That reads as a triple top to me on the chart which the stock can't seem to break above.  Hopefully pressure is building and it will happen sooner than later.

"Continuation of my post above.(Again I copy/pasted this post of mine from another article, and it references this article written by Cornerstone Investments.  I would love the OP to chime in!)I don't have time left to dig deep on Canopy for a full comparison - but I did find an SA article from Jan 2018 that can at least shed some light - *BUT* again id be curious how much of this square footage is *pure cultivation space* and how much is used for support buildings (r&d, office space, shipping & handling, etc.) My dig into ACBFF and its partners seems to imply that all of those additional facilities are calculated into the total sq footage.) THIS MAY BE INCORRECT.Here is a quick copy/paste:""Canopy was the first LP to receive license to sell medical cannabis in Canada and was the first cannabis company to trade on the TSX. *Canopy current has (through acquisitions) licensed production capacity of 20,650 kg per year* and has announced expansions plans to increase its *production capacity from 600k sq. ft.* to over 2.4 million sq. ft. over the new few years.""Correct me if I am wrong, but it does look like most of TWMJF's major facilities are outdoor farms? From my previous research, I see that nets a much smaller yield than indoor purpose-built grow facilities.Source: https://seekingalpha.c... (Written by Cornerstone Investments)",
"Last Post - Synopsis (Copy/Paste again)In short - according to my quick calculations on ACBFF vs TWMJF cultivation production, here are the ROUGH results on CURRENT cultivation capabilities (no future projects included):-ACBFF produces 15,800 kg per year using 192,200 sq ft -vs-TWMJF produces 20,650 kg per year using 600,000 sq ft-Important to note I calculated ACBFF cultivation space only counting square footage I could nail down as pure cultivation, to the best of my knowledge.-In Comparison, for TWMJF I only have the 600,000 square foot calculation from the one article I listed above, and I have no idea of how much of that square footage is used by supporting buildings, rather than pure cultivation.Maybe Cornerstone Investments OP can do me the honor of chiming in, and seeing what he would add to my calculations?  :)Honestly, I think the noticeable ratio difference in yield per square foot is simply TWMJF outdoor Pot farms vs ACBFF Indoor Grow facilities with controlled environments and designed for maximum yield.This is all based off my research above.  Thanks in advance for your thoughts, corrections, and opinions!",
"I actually just did quite a bit of research into current cultivation capacity for ACBFF, minus any future projects or partners of theirs where I couldnt nail down exactly what they provided in terms of current cultivation capacity.

Im invested in both, so I figured I would repost it here and see if I cant get a conversation going, corrections, opinions, etc.    Here it is:Here is what I pulled off the ACBFF investor dashboard as far as *cultivation facilities* including co-owned facilities.

It also does not include any kilo's from H2Biopharma as I cant be sure if its active production, or future production.-------------------------Part 2: Full Info and all Sources I used to make the calculations above + Info on all future already-funded projects from ACBFF and its partners that I could find:INFO DIRECTLY FROM ACBFF taken from http://bit.ly/2pN3k5x#/*ACBFF's own statement on it's capacity:*""With a *funded footprint* of over 2,000,000 square feet, *which at full capacity should produce* in excess of 240,000 kg per year of high-quality cannabis, Aurora is one of the world's largest and fastest growing cannabis companies.""***ACTUAL -ONLINE- CULTIVATION FACILITIES LISTED FIRST*** (Info taken from same site)""The Company currently has two fully operational facilities:Aurora Mountain (Cremona, AB), and Aurora Vie (Pointe-Claire, QC).""-Aurora MTN - (Indoor purpose-built facility) 55,200 Sq Feet & 4,800 kg per annumAurora VIE - (Also indoor, appears to be renovated, not built from scratch) - 40,000 Sq Feet - 4,000 kg per annumCannimed cultivation facilities are NOT listed on the ACBFF dashboard - at all - very strange, so I went to: http://bit.ly/2HMIoFM         Here is their info on current capacity, but keep in mind this is from a website of a company that is now entirely owned by ACBFF.

Another reason why CanniMed should merge with Aurora,
"Aurora Exclusive Winner of First Italian Government Medical Cannabis TenderCNW GroupJanuary 18, 2018First Private Company to Directly Supply Cannabis to Italian MarketTSX: ACBVANCOUVER , Jan. 18, 2018 /CNW/ - Aurora Cannabis Inc. (""Aurora"") (ACB.TO) (ACBFF) ( Frankfurt : 21P; WKN: A1C4WM) today announced that, together with its wholly owned German subsidiary Pedanios GmbH, the Company has won a highly competitive EU-wide public tender to supply medical cannabis to the Italian government through the Ministry of Defence, who oversees medical cannabis production and distribution in Italy .While the Italian Ministry of Defence currently produces medical cannabis for the domestic market, certain wholesalers are permitted to purchase directly from the Dutch Office of Medical Cannabis, a sharp rise in demand has led to the government seeking external parties to provide additional supply. The EU-wide public tender process consisted of 2 rounds. In the first round, those companies eligible to move towards the final tender round were pre-qualified. Only two companies, including Pedanios, qualified for this final round, in which Pedanios was ultimately chosen as the sole supplier under the tender. Following the signing of the contact in the coming days, Aurora will export product into Germany through Pedanios, who will supply the Italian market through the Ministry of Defence.""I am very proud of Aurora and the Pedanios team for the quality of their execution in becoming the exclusive winner of this important tender, and gaining access to one of the largest and most restricted markets in Europe ,"" said Neil Belot , Chief Global Business Development Officer. ""Aurora will soon supply both Germany and Italy - two of the largest EU markets, with a total population exceeding 143 million. As the only company to have been successful in this tender, we have an incredible first mover advantage in this potentially tremendous growth market.""Andrea Ludwig Ferrari , responsible for sales and market development in Italy , added, ""Aurora and Pedanios' EU GMP certifications were crucial in being successful in our bid for the tender in this demanding jurisdiction. We are now the first private cannabis company in the world able to supply the Italian government directly, a testament to the quality of our operations and the standing of our organization. This win positions us exceptionally well to continue executing successfully on our aggressive international expansion strategy.""",

"http://bit.ly/2FvEfSTOn January 8th of this year Aphria announced that the company had entered into a ""strategic agreement"" with Double Diamond Farms that will supposedly provide Aphria with an additional 120K Kg of annual cannabis production that will be produced by DDF. At the same time Nuuvera announced an off-take agreement with Aphria that will result in 60K Kg of that production being sold to Nuuvera by Aphria. If you add up these numbers and compare them to the licensed capacity of the four largest producers in Canada (according to this article), none of the numbers make sense? If the agreements announced by Aphria and Nuuvera are to be believed then DDF is going to provide Aphria with more annual production than the four largest licensed producers in Canada are producing at this time. The amount of cannabis that Aphria will be left with after it off-loads half the 120K Kg to Nuuvera is more than 6 times the licensed capacity of Aphria and 60% of it's available capacity based on the figures quoted in this article.Since DDF would have to produce 120K Kg to fulfill the agreement with Aphria it seems to me that DDF would be far and away the largest producer in Canada if Canopy Growth's licensed capacity is currently only 21,650Kg....So, where are all of the giant greenhouses or grow facilities that are being operated by DDF to produce this 120K Kg of cannabis that they are planning to sell to Aphria?",

"Bert, fantastic overview on this company. Great job!I have been also thinking about opening a position in this company.One of the key metrics to be tracked for a company with monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is monthly churn. If they have a strong moat it will be reflected most accurately in the churn rate metric.If the product is genuinely ""sticky"" then the cost of moving from them to a third party becomes much higher than the cost of staying. The risk of moving to a third party is not to be underestimated when it comes to the mission critical nature of a live, real-time database. You don't move something like this for a few pennies.Do they offer a churn-rate metric?Valuation on a Price to Sales metric shows it at 10 plus times revenue - which seems high but I don't know the relative comparison.When does lockup expire?I am also very interested in opening a position in this name as a long term hold.Thanks once again for the article.",

Facebook is really getting crushed today.  I was surprised to see it being down so much so went searching for the news.   Could this be a bit of an overreaction?

"Zuckerberg rarely makes decisions that are totally selfless.... Frankly, I view this as a well positioned move to squeeze more money out of non-paying media companies with the added benefit of reducing toxicity of some bad players. Wait for the new new subscription model to drop in 2018 with a hefty commission stream for FB for media. Beyond that any other media company wanting to promote content now needs to buy more ads. As an added bonus the FB environment becomes more friendly leading hopefully to higher retention and better positioned for further growth in, for instance, media-sensitive China.... Politically this looks smart and like a mea culpa. Economically this could quickly turn out to be the smartest thing they have done in 2018 :) Just bought more on the dip at market opening.

"I hold the same conviction as the author; I expect ad pricing to remain very strong as the growth in number of ads delivered through newsfeed decelerates. Analysts are projecting something like 13% earnings growth for $fb this year, on revenue growth of 33%. That would imply some massive margin pressure, that I don't think will be as bad as predicted (although this hinges on pricing). And even at that rate, the stock is still not priced excessively. In this market, there are plenty of companies in the mid-20 P/E range with substantially slower growth and none of the optionality referred to in the article with regards to Instagram etc. I am long and intend to stay long.",

"Last year when I first got into Yamana (my first Precious Metal stock), I clearly didn't know much about the debt and cash flow issue, nor about the seasonal Gold trends, didn't do my homework. I welcome, both, the recent positive news from Yamana and the seasonal uptrend in Gold. Moving forward, I think my strategy with Yamana will be to trim some of my holdings in the weeks ahead (slightly above my purchase price), this way I can free up the initial big 'lump-sum' investment of mine from last year, while maintaining a core position. On a potential retracement, I would like to average down the core position.  The other stock where I would like to see some good news is Eldorado.

"Fun tradingPlease don’t be so full of yourself.  I acknowledged that ALL gold stocks will rise with a bull market in gold.  I also acknowledge that Yamana has masterfully rejiggered its finances , especially with the two recent Divestiture and VPP Deal And will ESpECIALLY outpace other miners in the coming bull market.I firmly believe AUY will greatly outperform in the coming big bull market.  Expect to see gold challenge its 2016/17 highs of $1375ish after its technical breakout above $1320 on Friday.  $1500 easily by mid-Q2. AUY will go bonkers and race to 4.50+ in that timeframe.",
"Fun TradingGold will break out above $1365 in the very near future....Perhaps not on the first try, but soon thereafter.....When gold breaks above into the 1400s, it will move like greased lightning to $1500.As gold fell from its 2011 peak of $1900 to its bear market bottom of $1050ish in 2015, do you know how many trading days it closed in the $1400s?Amazingly, it closed in the $1400s just 28 days, out of a total of 2000+ trading days from Aug 2011 peak to Aug 2017.   So, technically speaking, there was very little ""price discovery"" done in the $1400s.Ergo, I believe (but cannot prove) that gold will slice upwards through the $1400s far faster than anybody thinks possible.  As gold escapes the $1300s, it is leaving behind nearly 1050 days spent trading between $1050 and $1399 during the past 6+ years.....Lots of pent up energy as it finally escapes this ""blackish"" hole of the past 4-5 years when the bottom really fell out back in 2013.In such an environment, ALL gold stocks will skyrocket.  But, stocks such as AUY which have been pounded mercilessly (and perhaps, correctly) will outperform on the way back up, especially with the organic growth that is occurring now and the likely large debt paydown that is almost assuredly in the bag with such bullish gold/copper/silver prices to come.Get on board",

"Does these resistance levels and such details work for mining stocks? I believe they are more for gold and silver prices and mining company shares are slaves to gold prices.

"Consumer and animal rights group’s demand for more space for birds has been the most significant uncertainty for the egg industry over the last ten years. The $80 million settlement is the result of producers trying to collectively appease consumers and the Humane Society of the U.S. (HSUS) by reducing the number of hens in each cage.Currently retail groceries and HSUS are advocating for more cage free hens, but the retail consumer at the grocery store is still mostly choosing the cheaper generics. If you are a producer that needs to add or replace capacity what do you build? a cage free facility with more costs and eggs the consumer might not want? or a conventional cage facility that might be obsolete with a future regulation promoted by HSUS?Reducing birds per cage didn’t cost producers too much, but building new or converting to cage free facilities is a huge investment.As to feed cost, I believe higher feed costs are better for CALM. It is counter intuitive, but producers have the ability to react very quickly to changes in production costs as the normal 2-year hen life can be adjusted. I believe that increases in feed costs eventually lead to a disproportionate increase in egg prices. And when corn drops to $3.50 we get 85 cent UB SE large egg prices. Feed is just one of many factors effecting egg prices. U.S. and world bird flu or changes in U.S. or world hen numbers also influence egg price.Demand for eggs, however, has been on a steady rise on a per capita basis for most of the last three decades.

How could anyone not agree that management has not run this company in the stock holders best interest. Excluding all the screw up with their lack of actuarial pricing of LTC products along with life ins. While I'm long this company in spite of an inept management GNW is worth more in its parts than whole $7-$8.,
"Just a few thoughts going forward with GNW:*. They have poor management that is self serving their own interests- big negative*.  Interest rate environment rising-Postive for GNW*.  IMHO the various States ( and their Regulators) that have a large number GNW LTC policies     will be cooperative in allowing rate increases by GNW ( at least to a fair point) in the future.    They absolutely, have no desire to have to deal with a large LTC firm in receivership in their      respective States.  Talk about  an expense and pain in the a—.*.  Large Short positions in the stock- any really positive catalyst, could easily start a short       squeeze.  If so, a sharp, large percentage move in price via a multi day rally.*.  I don’t think the merger is going to happen- mainly due to the political situation now.     The 3rd party oversight is positive, but I’m not sure if that is still good enough for the      security concerns to be overcome. If it happens, it happens.  If not, GNW stock has already     pulled back, because of the delays.  If it doesn’t go through, GNW should survive,     and move back above $5 overtime- quicker if management is changed ( Pretty Please).*.  One of the reasons GNW hasn’t rallied ( besides all the over hanging issues)with the    rest of the market, is that it’s been too easy to make money with any number of well    managed, profitable, non- troubled companies.  However, valuations are now very rich     on many of these.  Going forward from a percentage move upward, GNW could offer     a better return.  I feel a better and a more positive visibility will return to GNW, based upon improving financials, regulatory liency (regarding rates),  interest rates, and larger investors seeing a momentum value play when a short squeeze occurs via positive news.   *. My sense iis GNW heads back toward 4.50-5.00 in 2018.   *.  Wish someone out there could dump the CEO and much of his Board.Long GNW",
Thanks for the analysis. I think the risk with the deal is if the Trump administration wants the Chinese to have access to the personal information of policy holders (some government workers). This could be a big security risk. Your analysis showed me a lot about the value of the separate pieces. But oh wow the LTC piece scares me a lot.,

If I recall, the balance sheet contains an asset which is something like ""price increases we think we'll get, but haven't yet"" and it is that asset which is about $7bn as of the last 10K.  If what you say is true, then it sounds like the hole was even bigger than $7bn as of 2015.In any event, the CEO is not credible on this topic - he seems to be behaving in a far from value creating manner, and the hypothesis on these boards is that he's after scaring everyone into believing the CO offer is a really good deal and the world will end if GNW doesn't take it (and get him his double digit exit bonus whilst continuing to be CEO).",
"Hi Pogonific,Terrific thoughts - thanks so much.I hadn't put all the pieces together before your posting.  But, ok, let me play with your ideas.Your big point is the $7B of LTC rate increases that ALREADY are on the BS.  Yes - booking these increases before they happen seems questionable.  But - if my previous math is anywhere near correct - the LTC rate increases are about halfway accomplished (when one projects them over the next ten years).  So booking the entire plug amount of $7B now - while still questionable - has more substance behind it than it did at the start of 2015.So if this reasoning is going in the right direction, then why does the CEO still quote the $7B figure without any qualification describing the effect of the rate increases already enacted and in-force, and why doesn't the market begin to recognize the rate improvement with a higher stock price?  Am I missing something or have I made a big mistake in assumptions somewhere along the line?Again - a pleasure to ""talk"" with you about this interesting stock situation...",
"Well, I'm not 7SCCM, but they've been very patient with my questions, so I'll try to have a stab at this as a help.  The 7SCCM investment thesis behind GNW assumes LTC goes bust - i.e. your math may well be true but is irrelevant.  The assumption rests on the fact that when you buy GNW you buy stock in a holding company that owns the LTC equity.  Just as you as a shareholder are not directly liable for the LTC hole, neither is GNW HoldCo.  If you believe that, then the thesis is that all the other bits of GNW HoldCo are worth significantly in excess of today's market cap.  What happens to LTC?  Well, it's the regulators' / policyholders' problem -GNW HoldCo just values it at 0.  I don't know enough to tell you what to believe, but that at least is the thesis, so your question is somewhat irrelevant though important.As far as your math is concerned, it seems OK to me - but the thing to add which you may well know is that the current GNW book value assumes those $7bn of rises are already there on the BS - if it didn't, the company would be well in negative equity and the regulators will have had to seize it already.  It's pretty adventurous accounting if you ask me, but the whole LTC business model strains the GAAP accounting approach to its limit - GAAP just isn't designed for such long dated assets/liabilities requiring plenty of assumptions to be valued.",
"Hello Seven Corners,On the broadcast of the annual meeting, McInerney emphasized that the company needed $7.3B more in premium increases to balance out LTC (and this is what the 2016 10K seems to say on page 105).So I'm no actuary - but I wonder if you could straighten out my thinking on this matter.  [BTW, for the record I am long GNW].From the company's presentation, GNW has raised LTC premiums in the three-year 2015-17(e) period by about 28% on about $2MM of in-force premiums.  To my way of thinking, this is over a half-billion dollars in new premiums coming in ($2MM times 28%).  Now if you discount these new premiums by some smallish percentages for those who will drop their policies and for those who will go onto benefit status (I used - pulling these figures out of the air - a 5% drop in policies in the 1st year, and a 5% rate per year for those who would go on benefit), that still leaves - OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD - $4 billion+ in new premium income.  This amount is more than half of the $7.3B that the company says it needs -- and the company seems to be achieving more rate increases every year.  So the conclusion here is that while the $7.3B hole is massive, it seems as if it is getting filled.  OK.  That's my math.  It's fine if you tell me I am way off base with my thinking.  And it's fine if you tell me to go read some actuary book as background.....Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.",
"The key issue still remains - does negative equity at US life/LTC decrease equity at HoldCo or not.  If not, then this is a reasonable analysis.  If yes, then all your numbers are a rounding error on what management decide to put out for Q4 numbers. And I really mean decide, as reporting LTC with GAAP allows management to make assumptions which can make the numbers be anything they want them to be. One other thing that isn't clear to me - bond yields going up will mean a material reduction in the value of the bond portfolio.  So there may be paper losses coming in from that as well.  Good luck to all.",

That translates into a more robust Aussie housing market which should benefit GNW Aus. One thing that concerns me is lax underwriting in GNW Canada's MI. Seems like their loss ratio is too high compared to the delinquency rate. Any idea why that might be the case other than bad underwriting? Are there other hidden surprises in the underwriting that will only be discovered in a downturn?I'm writing mainly from the perspective of the 2066 floating rate jr subordinated bonds.,

Excellent insight on MRO!Thanks for the contribution and I hope you will write again soon.,
Good article. Long since June.,
How is it that you’re saying their international operations are all revenue with almost no cost?,
Good article.  People often forget that MRO is an international oil company and has a lot of irons in the fire.  We should break $20 within the next week or two.,

"Thanks for you objective article.Well done.Based upon the reasons outlined in your article -a strong balance sheet, positive supply/demand metrics in oil, and an intelligent business plan being implemented, I/we feel MRO represents one of the best energy plays for the next couple of years Our near term target is 21-22 by May.LONG MRO stock and Jan, 2019 & 2020 $8 Calls.",
"Thanks for the discussion and pointing out the Libya exposure. If I remember correctly, much of the concern over Libyan production is that a) the oil is highly desirable, particularly for diesel and b) close to Europe.....All in all, considering how shaky Venezuela is, I suspect Libya may not be that terrible a risk? It just needs to be supported by a sensible foreign policy on our part.Jay",
"Excellent breakdown of the company's production numbers... as a small shareholder I have noticed the daily ""drip drip"" up of the share price.With marginal production of Libyan assets going forward, where do you see the share price in 3 to 5 years? I know the price of oil plays a major role in this, but with all things equal, do you see a $60 price target as some people are suggesting?",
"This looks like your first article?  Welcome to SA!One comment.....although the headline Marathon net oil production increase from Libya is impressive as a percentage of their total net production, the tax rate on the Libya production is something crazy like 90%+. I tried to look it up on the web, but could not find it quickly. I believe MRO’s president said as much in a recent conference call. Unless there are some loss carry forwards or some other tax shelter in Libya to shield that income, Marathon will see very little of the increased production in their cash flow or net earnings.",Marathon Oil-Phoenix In The Desert

Mike nailed the problem:http://bit.ly/2EMU4Du,
"Ford's numbers are coming down hard in 2018 as I expected --- one major problem is they're not disclosing the amount of damage yet to come vis a vis the two items I've listed above --- I see 4-9 quarters of profits AT RISK just on these items.Humidity alone is worsening the Takata Air Bag problem IN ALL VEHICLES.  Besides the fact they go off unexpectedly, they also ""grenade"" sending shrapnel throughout the passenger compartment.Stock is a MAJOR DUMP --- with both hands.",
"Attached is Ford's petition to get some (3.04M ) of its SIX MILLION defective Takata air bag recalls delayed -- DENIED by the US Govt and there's plenty more where that came from - the government's had it with Ford's lack of response, delay tactics.  The data is NOT MADE UP like some posters here.  What I find truly concerning with the Ford petition is it covers vehicles with recent Takata related deaths --- the company should be ashamed of themselves.  I think ultimately there will be criminal liability.http://bit.ly/2ri6ql6For those of you not in the business, the problem gets worse as the air bags in these cars age --- more deaths are coming.

"I feel F stock is in a weird place.  I think the Bears did get it wrong  the past couple years by betting that F was going to get crushed by a cyclical downturn.  They drove the price down, but the reality has been a rotation into trucks and SUVs.   And in so much as SAAR has trended down, Ford so far has successfully matched production with demand.   Ford has maintained strong earnings, even if it has flattened and their balance sheet has only gotten better since Ford share's price hit $16.  The bond market loves Ford.  For the immediate future the U.S. economy looks good and Ford is investing in the future.  All that suggests Ford is poised for a positive snap back to at least $15-16.But there has always been the legitimate concern that the economy will go into the recession and that the auto industry will be on the leading edge of feeling that recession.   And right now, it feels a lot like 2005.   The U.S. continues to wage perpetual war all over the globe, billions are spent on disaster relief.  We have tax cuts.  It is seemingly all good.  Yet the Fed is gradually but steadily raising rates and taking money out of the system.     The upshot is that I feel investors are okay with being in auto stocks, but that they are also positioning themselves by the exit doors.",

With F getting the best ATPs, managing inventory well, and rolling out more and more aluminum, we likely will see a better 2018 than 2017.F is sitting on a huge stash of cash and getting ready to roll out even better PUs and SUVs. That is where the profits (margins) will be for some time to come. That is where they look to be concentrating until the next ""new"" AV or augmented vehicles start to roll out.

A third party to buy the Dupont/FMC  company too quickly before a transition is well underway will be taking a big risk in obtaining efficiencies in the medium term.

My enthusiasm for SQM waxed and waned to the extent that I traded it mostly based on technical indicators (I've found the MACD histogram to work fairly well for this stock).  With respect to LIT, it always bothered me that it plays both the producing and consuming aspects of lithium.  What is good for Tesla is not necessarily good for SQM and vice versa.  A few months ago I sought companies that were strictly on the producing side of the equation that I could buy through my US broker.  This led me to buy OROCF and NMKEF.  Your article opens others for investigation.  Thank you.

"marketwatch:Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be reorganized as private, utility-like entities, and the government should provide an explicit guarantee for mortgages in order to preserve the popular 30-year fixed-rate loan, the regulator of the two government-sponsored mortgage enterprises said this week.Mel Watt, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the regulator created to oversee the two enterprises at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, had previously held back when asked for his views on the appropriate shape for the future of the housing-finance system, saying such a determination was up to Congress.But as the situation for Fannie FNMA, +6.37%   and Freddie FMCC, +6.83%   became more fraught, that has changed.Watt in May told the Senate Banking Committee that reform was “urgently” needed. “These conservatorships are not sustainable and they need to end as soon as Congress can chart the way forward on housing finance reform,” he said.Read: Fannie and Freddie are nearly out of money and Washington is getting anxiousIn recent months, a bipartisan consensus has started to emerge around what the future housing finance system should look like. In the January 16 letter to Mike Crapo and Sherrod Brown, the two senators leading the efforts, Watt said he had decided to make recommendations in response to requests from Congress following the May hearing.“In recent months, perhaps attributable to the growing perception that reform could be achievable this year, FHFA has received a number of new or renewed requests for our views,” Watt wrote.Still, he said, “it is the prerogative and responsibility of Congress, not FHFA, to decide on housing-finance reform.”The two enterprises now have capital buffers of only $3 billion and even that slim amount was hard-fought to secure, the result of negotiations between FHFA and the Treasury Department. Previously, the two enterprises were set to start 2018 with no capital, according to a 2012 amendment to the 2008 bailout. The zero-capital arrangement was designed to force Congress to take action to establish a future housing finance system, in order to avoid a repeat of the 2008 taxpayer bailout.Under Watt’s recommendation, Fannie and Freddie would be reincorporated as “private, shareholder-owned corporations with a regulated rate of return.” The government would provide an “explicit and paid-for catastrophic guarantee” on mortgage bonds issued by the two entities — and any private players.The broad outlines of Watt’s proposal are generally in line with what most housing finance watchers believe is the best, and most likely, housing finance system moving forward. That view is in line with the direction in which the two enterprises, under FHFA regulation, have already started to move.Read: Congress wouldn’t do it, so Fannie and Freddie reformed themselvesIndustry participants welcomed Watt’s step.In a statement, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s head lobbyist, Bill Killmer, said “MBA is grateful for the well-informed input provided by the Director and hope that it contributes to momentum for congressional action on reform.”And Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics and a long-time housing finance watcher who advanced his own proposal in 2016, called it “a good plan both from an economic and political perspective.”The plan would protect taxpayers, preserve the 30-year fixed-rate loan that’s considered the linchpin of American homeownership, “and provide broad access to loans for underserved communities,” Zandi said, while also keeping a level playing field for small lenders. “It is a solid reform proposal that should advance the ball on getting reform done.”Shares of Fannie and Freddie surged 7% and nearly 6%, respectively, this week. Shareholders were essentially wiped out by the 2012 amendment and have fought for restitution, and clarity, in multiple court cases.",

"Does anyone else feel like they are going crazy reading all these proposals about reform to have an explicit garuntee to bail out entities in the event of a downturn? I want the opposite, an explicit garuntee to not bail out FnF and allow them to operate as private companies for better or for worse. That may mean mortgage rates will be higher but so be it, at least they will be truly competing against other companies. I don't understand how the politicians want explicit garuntee and yet also have more competition available... Who is going to compete against a company that is subsidized to keep artificially low mortgage rates, it doesn't make any sense to me.",
"""the companies themselves should be allowed to fail""Does he mean the current companies?? - put in R/ship and transfer whatever to new companies and wipe out the current F&F common, etc?OR - is this supposed to be a forward looking statement meaning IF IN THE FUTURE THE CURRENT ENTITIES screw it up, we'll let them fail? - (ie - the next doozy subprime screw up that WStreet will surely engineer after everyone's short memories take hold).Watt has  to know that statement could be interpreted a couple of ways.....he needs to clarify what he means but then again, he's a politician so don't expect anything.Sort of important since the first statement basically is Watt giving an OK to Corker, etc. to kill the current companies (and let the losses fall where they may).",

"@Poor DudeI'd like to hear your take on this. The day before the imposition of conservatorship, 09/05/08, FNMA closed at $7.04 per share. At that point no government action had taken place, no conservatorship, accounting shenanigans, bailout, nothing. Even if a court found that a taking had happened, why would they award FNMA shareholders with anything more than $7.04 per share? That would certainly be the most expedient course of action because it wouldn't involve any guesswork as to what the shares would have been worth.Even then, wouldn't this only apply to shareholders who have continuously held shares since before the conservatorship? Anyone who bought after the original SPSPA knew about the existence of the warrants so that can't constitute a taking for them.",
"If they take a draw it won’t effect the value that great and if it does, marginally. It’s already a known that it will happen, but to the extent of much is the unknown. I talked about it earlier. Freddie has a smaller book of business and might not need to take a draw at all. Fannie due to the size of their portfolio will have to take a draw and it will probably be between 6-8 billion. Has anyone seen the Bloomberg article today? More nothing, and in reality, it didn’t make sense to me. It discussed how the lowering of standards is hurting the industry due to the competition of having just 2 entities. But the reality is, they want to open it up for shared risk which will only increase risk from lowered standards across the board with people chasing limited inventory. You can’t have it both ways. The best fix they can do is not do anything and allow it to be business as usual and focus on regulating the industry as a whole in regards to risk based portfolio pricing and not allowing the joint securitization platform to take on high risk portfolios.  But, that’s just my two cents.",

After that has taken place the case will be put on the agenda for a conference which will decide whether the case will be taken and the questions to be resolved.  There are a number of other possible actions which the Court can take including additional briefing on standing, additional briefing on a new issue, briefing on finality, return the case to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings, or to hold it until another case which is seeking a Writ of Cert to get further along in the process so that it can be consolidated with this one for oral argument.I am not sure how helpful this is for you.

Glen has no commons and he claims he writes this for himself.  Why does he not brag his preferred is more valuable than something else like SEARS?,
"By Carisa Chappellcchappell@imfpubs.comAfter rumors surfaced late this week that Sen. Mark Warner, D-VA, was walking away from supporting the housing finance reform bill (Corker-Warner) he has been crafting with Sen. Bob Corker, R-TN, a source close to the discussions confirmed that is not the case.It started on Jan. 11 when the executive director of GSE shareholders group Investors Unite tweeted, “CW 2.0 is dead. Just C no more W.” That set off a firestorm of questions on Twitter with industry observers wondering if and why Warner may have bailed. Some suggested he had bigger fish to fry or didn’t want to lay off employees in his state if Freddie Mac was no more under the proposed legislation.But a source told IMFnews this morning, “The team of Corker and Warner is actively working on this legislation.” They also appear to be looking for another Democrat to get on board with Sen. Warner in order for it to be a truly bipartisan bill and have a chance at passing. The source noted that the rumors on Twitter have been promoted primarily from hedge fund and shareholder interests.Tim Howard, former Fannie Mae executive, said in a blog posting, “Even if Warner is not actively working with Corker on what’s been called Corker-Warner 2.0, and I haven’t yet seen confirmation of this, that’s different from ‘not supporting’ Corker’s initiative, and certainly not the same as ‘walking away from’ it.”",
"You lost me at ""MBA.""",
Looks like Warner did not walk out of the room and may be supporting Corker. Slow bleed of commons continues. Next hit will be the supreme court ruling.,
"It appears to me that with the write down's of the deferred tax liability with the new tax law that the Treasury is going to have to act one way or another fairly soon.  Since the Constitutional questions will still take several years to address -- as I have my doubts that SCOTUS will give a direct ruling if they hear the Perry Writ, but more likely mandate that the lower courts revisit this issue with guidance.  I'd like to be wrong, but with Billion's at stake, few judges are willing to take a stand like Sweeny.  It does make sense for Treasury to convert and later sell - AKA GM bailout.  But since they need to let the company recapitalize first to get the most gain, that is going to be a multi-year process.  In the meantime, preferred dividends will not get paid until capital requirements are achieved.  I have owned 4K FNMA from before Hank's ""cut them off at the head"" action. That is almost $100,000 in lost dividends; so much for a ""taxpayer"" being ""saved.""",
"Poor Glen is getting beat up for being a GSE common basher when if he's guilty of anything it's being a GSE common fence sitter.

"Glen--I believe that you may be emphasizing the wrong facts in the matters which you covered.I would submit that the Joint Status document is tremendously important.

This language is broad enough to allow for the Amended Complaint to bring in all of the Constitutional issues--the very things which the Courts have previously said were not raised.Glen, if you take all of the articles which you have written along with the comments which supplemented what you wrote, it is clear that the government has been caught having to disclose some very damaging documents.  It appears that some of the documents make clear that there was a clear violation of the Constitution, probably the ""takings"" clause.Whether the government agreed to the filing of the Amended Complaint just because of the documents which were disclosed or because Sessions is now running the Department of Justice, I cannot tell.  Regardless, there has been a major change.What does this portend?  If the Amended Complaint comes in with numerous allegations of violations of the Constitution, the table will be set for either a settlement or a case which is designed to go to the Supreme Court.  It has clearly grown beyond a case between the Plaintiffs and the Government.Just a thought or two.  I will now wait for the other legal types to critique/supplement my statements.",

"solid article. corkers bill is DOA. and most likely anything from congress is DOA.. This really is not a hard fix.  only people we need to fix this is mnuchin and watt.  which both know exactly how important the companies are... and watt is weak,(very smart but weak) so expect mnuchin to have his way.So NOW that the companies are done having the life sucked out of them, it simply is a liability for the Treasury to have the current deal in place.  So logically they(Treasury & FHFA) will renegotiate at the end of the qtr.  I dont know what that means. it cld possibly mean:1.) they keep a div(not nws) going to the treasury, but that doesnt fix any problems, simply kicks the can down the road and that doesnt sound like a trump thing to do. 2.) convert the warrants and raise cap on private mkts, refinancing higher div ( jr pref), thus they get paid out at par, and they regulator allows a certain time period to get back to a certain % of capital buffer... this wld take away the liability of a bailout off the treasury, allow them to gain capital from warrants during the trump administrations reign in office, and even allow shareholder to win, both common and pref.. 3.) kill the companies like corker has wanted, this loses money for everyone, and possibly creates a potential housing crisis, and lending crisis in rural lower areas.-- YUGE FAIL, will never happen-- almost amazing how far he got with such bad ideas4.) Treasury decides they have a heart, release the companies, dont execute warrants, and let them raise in priv mkts... there is zero incentive for the treasury to do that, which means it also creates zero incentive to (allow them to keep their charter).. probability of this is very very low with how the court cases have went.the way I see it is #2 is really the only solution because it allows everyone to walk away with higher return, and  on safer ground... That essentially is MOELIS plan.. and common guys, i get it its not fair to common, but having the treasury execute warrants gives them incentive to actually keep the companies which is HUGE after being able to see the malice intentions of TBTF banks and their minions on their payroll some of which are in congressjust a guess but heres my perdition: end of q1 everything starts moving, preferred=par-ish,--(that % conversion from bezinga was a BS hypothetical idea of theirs, but if there is one thing we know from the court cases, its that jr pref have contract rights, meaning PAR) common=relist: 10ish",

I have not yet got to the point where any single position has become so big that I feel a need to trim it, although that may well happen this year.I also focus MOSTLY on technicals, but do like to also go with positions where there is a pretty good underlying narrative to support the trend. So far, this has all been working very well for me. Up over 30% last year - and up over 12% YTD !!!!!I do want to make a point about practicing. When I was a teenager, I used to play the piano. Unfortunately, until I was 16 I had a lousy teacher (the local church organist), who basically didn't really teach me anything at all about technique or how to practice. So although I did practice a lot, all I was really doing was reinforcing the many bad habits I had already picked up. Not good at all.Then I got a modest scholarship (I forget how!) that allowed me to get professional teachers for two instruments. So my new piano teacher was a professional concert pianist, who basically had to start over with teaching me basic techniques - and in particular techniques of how to practice. Finally, I started to make very good progress, although unfortunately that only lasted until I went to university a couple of years later.I also started learning cello, and again I was able to get a world-class soloist as my teacher (we lived in Oxfordshire, England, and there were many good musicians around because it was not only a great place to live, but also an easy commute down to London). So I also got a great start learning technique for string instruments.The point here is that unless you actually know good technique and how to practice it, practicing by itself simply won't help !!!!Cheers, Ian",

"@James Sands, thank you for a great review of the ROKU situation. IMHO, it was analyst snobbery that drove ROKU's stock value down. And I agree with GreenPirate - it served the analysts who wanted to buy more at lower values. ROKU is not too late to the party. While the streaming service moat is rather crowded, until the likes of HULU IPO, we don't have a test case for the space beyond ROKU. From that perspective, it seems out of parity to compare ROKU to Netflix because the two stories are very different., in spite of the fact that ROKU was also founded in 2002 and incorporated in 2008.  Netflix was an early disrupter in the DVD space with a slow maturity rate. From 2002 to 2010, Netflix's stock value was in single digits with a 2:1 stock split in 2004; broke into the teens in 2010, spiked to high 30s in 2011, sunk back to single digits in 2012 and then finally started climbing in 2013 as its streaming media service took hold. It had a 7:1 stock split in 2015. ROKU has it's own history and now is breaking into a mature space with its own mature product. ROKU's success or failure may be more about consumer acceptance versus product quality.",

The company owns the rights to Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm films and TV shows, as well as broadcast content from ABC and ESPN.

"Roku makes money by licensing content and putting it up for free, they sell ads to support the cost.

Once they scale up more, what is to stop them from making an apple/Android/firetv/web app and scale further across other devices??? I see this as a Catalyst not many people are talking about. I would love to hear other people’s opinions on this. I agree Roku has an inflated value due to people wanting a pure play in streaming that isn’t Netflix.

It's a shame that Canada cannot get behind their major resource.  My thinking was that they would ask for a phase in by all three lines; ENB south being the least preferred route.  However, USA is the BEST to build in, thus ENB will certainly be the earliest winner.  Others, if any, to be determined as the government should choose both, but ask for a phase in/ limited capacity expansion.  However, Quebec< I think will be the most difficult route; therefore, if the Barnaby bottleneck can be solved/resolved, KMI wins.

Hi does it matter if most of the sand Hi - Crush owns is from Wisconsin? Would it be affected by terminals coming up in Permian? My question is would Hi-crush sell at max of their capacity this year since fracking production is speeding up fast and more sand is needed in the process compared to 2014. That would make them a lot of money. Seems like they could make more money than 2014 this year.,
I am more focused on buybacks and in particular the next announcement of buybacks and average purchase price.  The first $20M was at an average price of $9.85/share which was a no brainer.  If mgmt. raised $0.01/qtr continuing to execute on the buyback there is a great chance that 6-8% of the float could be taken out depending on how opportunistic this mgmt. team is in regard to repurchases.Lenders giving HCLP clearance to repurchase $80M of outstanding shares shows a very high degree of confidence in HCLP's present operating profile with perhaps some surprise upsides.  Last quarter's earnings fell short of too high expectations.  This quarter's earnings very important because consensus is more in line with mgmt. expectations.,

"As an investor when you do your due diligence and really start to dig into what Blackberry is doing it's just astounding.  Blackberry stands a very good chance on being the standard operating system for future automobiles with QNX.   All the top providers have selected QNX.  This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as what Blackberry will be providing the industry.Blackberry will also play a huge role in the EOT area providing management of all these devices along with remote updating etc.  Combine this with the Certicom security and Blockchain it should be huge.Then they have all their phone related software and phones starting to be flagged as ""Secured By Blackberry""Then you have their Radar product which could end up on nearly every trailer and container entering or operating in the US for security and tracking purposes.Add in all their other products, patents and cash - amazing company with a huge future.",

"You shorts can bash Stan all you want.  I am sure he can take it.  But have you read the science?  How about the Nanoflu preclinical?  http://bit.ly/2xWs51OAre you denying what is so clearly stated in the abstract?AbstractInfluenza viruses frequently acquire mutations undergoing antigenic drift necessitating annual evaluation of vaccine strains. Highly conserved epitopes have been identified in the hemagglutinin (HA) head and stem regions, however, current influenza vaccines induce only limited responses to these conserved sites. Here, we describe a novel seasonal recombinant HA nanoparticle influenza vaccine (NIV) formulated with a saponin-based adjuvant, Matrix-M™. NIV induced hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralizing (MN) antibodies against a broad range of influenza A(H3N2) subtypes. In a comparison of NIV against standard-dose and high-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV and IIV-HD, respectively) in ferrets NIV elicited HAI and MN responses exceeding those induced by IIV-HD against homologous A(H3N2) by 7 fold, A(H1N1) by 26 fold, and B strain viruses by 2 fold. NIV also induced MN responses against all historic A/H3N2 strains tested, spanning more than a decade of viral evolution from the 2000–2017 influenza seasons whereas IIV and IIV-HD induced HAI and MN responses were largely directed against the homologous A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B virus strains. NIV induced superior protection compared to IIV and IIV-HD in ferrets challenged with a homologous or 10-year drifted influenza A(H3N2) strain. HAI positive and HAI negative neutralizing monoclonal antibodies derived from mice immunized with NIV were active against homologous and drifted influenza A(H3N2) strains. Taken together these observations suggest that NIV can induce responses to one or more highly conserved HA head and stem epitopes and result in highly neutralizing antibodies against both homologous and drift strains.Are you not aware that ferrets are the gold standard for studying flu infection?  http://bit.ly/2r6Pv4JFlu vaccines that work in ferrets have an excellent high chance of working for humans.The bottom line is not whether or not we trust Stan.  It's whether or not we trust all the hardworking scientists at NVAX and ferrets!Getting the data analysis right takes time.  Who wouldn't want them to be a little late just to get the science done right?I can wait and I can add more to my positions on the dips too.By the way, there are quite a few large pharma companies who would love to add to their portfolio of vaccines, especially one that has a novel platform using proprietary recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technology and a big patent portfolio.  We know they are watching and waiting for it to be de-risked.  I would not be surprised if we end up getting multiple suitors eventually.That's just for Nanoflu (I haven't even discussed RSV yet) and the current flu epidemic making front page headlines makes the timing exquisite for maximum exposure and potential ballistic-like price trajectory.",
"The author speaks of smoke and mirrors, the fact is NVAX does not ""fluff"" anything therefore quick buck types routinely hurt the SP. I always look through the smoke (which is folks or writers with a agenda) and concentrate my decisions on what the company actually tells us. In recent months you can boil it all down to a few data points. The Nanoflu vaccine appears to be off the charts compared to a already on the market flu vac (sanofi) and the RSV -M information unblinded by a 3rd party was very positive, a phase 3 trial. With the flu in the news like it is now, a blockbuster expected result from nanoflu 1/2 will highlight this biotech and likely launch the SP well off the beaten down price it has languished at for 18 months.",
"The H3N2 Flu is taking more lives as each day goes by without NanoFlu. Hopefully that day will come quicker than we anticipate for a successful NanoFlu.

They have actual evidence now that M-RSV is going to be successful, as the FDA gave them the informational ""sneak peek"" yes/no information they were seeking. NanoFlu is the bridge for a successful M-RSV, when NVAX finally reports the trial results this February on NanoFlu. The BMGF will continue to support NVAX & management in their quest to develop life saving vaccines. BARDA, BMGF-PATH & CEPI are standing by for funding when the time arrives to do so. As you know, Bill Gates was the ""Keynote speaker"" at the latest JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, showing that he has confidence himself in NVAX to succeed.  Watch the ""actions of NVAX management"" in the coming future for more positive direction concerning the company. They will succeed & BP is watching with $$$ at hand for when the opportune time calls. GSK is will probably be the first on the list of a few interested in a buyout of NVAX. We could possibly have a bidding war between them.  Novavax has a valuable asset in their ""technology platform"" Matrix-M. We are witnessing the coming of a new ""KING"" of vaccines in NVAX, as they revolutionize the way vaccines are developed, getting away from the flawed egg-based way of developing vaccines, as they are prone to mutations. The NVAX pipeline of vaccines, NanoFlu, M-RSV, future RSV-Flu combo, MERS, Ebola, Zika & possible future NanoFlu/Pandemic flu vaccine are a goldmine for any acquirer of Novavax. Stay tuned, as NVAX moves on to success.",

The company cannot survive the next 12 months without access to capital from Wall Street Banks or private investors. We estimate that Tesla will need roughly $8 billion in the next 18 months to fund operating losses, capital expenditures, debts coming due, and working capital needs. However, it appears that due to past SEC investigations and current investigations (which terrifyingly have not been disclosed by the company), it will likely be difficult for Tesla to access public markets. According to a recent analyst report, there have been 85 SEC requests for additional information and disclosures in the last 5 years. This compares to Ford Motor Company's total of zero over the same time frame. This means that Tesla is pushing many, many boundaries. When a company is under formal investigation, it is difficult, if not impossible, to raise capital from public markets as these investigations must be made public, which generally craters the equity and debt values. Therefore, Tesla investors better hope there are a number of Greater Fools in China or elsewhere to keep the company solvent. At some point, the music stops, and there aren't any open chairs. No matter how good a social investment makes you feel as it is going up, extreme anger will result if most or all of your money is permanently lost, especially when it is due to false and misleading statements by senior company officers.

If Musk handles information dissemination to the SEC the way he handles it to the public/investors, he better be able to explain his comments while under Oath.Poking the Bear (SEC/Regulatories) is something that Companies that sell risk instruments to the Public try to avoid with a passion.  SEC took a lot of heat by ignoring Madoff for decades.  Musk better thread carefully if he's being less than forthcoming when the Share price is into the $300's.Looking at the Balance Sheet alone should make Musk very cautious about prospective opinions that ignore financials and focus on how wonderful tomorrow will be.  Musk has that inclination, Imo/",
"It just make sense to wait for 4th quarter results to be post, and hear Tesla 1st quarter and 2018 expectations. COMMON SENSE!!! It is coming in a few weeks. And with the SEC watch dogs on the lookout, Tesla know they better be HONEST.",
"My opinion on Tesla:- I love their cars.  A friend of mine has one and when he took for me a ride in it, I have never experienced that kind of acceleration from any other car, including Porsches, Audis, Ferraris, etc.- I love the environment, polar bears, etc. and I love the idea of a more environmentally friendly energy source for cars in the future.- However, I have degrees in math and finance, and as much as I would love to see Tesla survive and thrive, it is almost mathematically impossible for them to survive another decade.Some of the reasons for this include:-	It has massive losses and will continue to lose money for the foreseeable future.-	It’s PE ratio is infinite due to the negative earnings.-	FAANG stocks, which have scary high valuations, are basically tech stocks that have low capital requirements, Tesla has very high capital requirements to build cars (plant and equipment).  Without earnings, they will have to raise capital through debt or equity markets, which will dilute the share price.-	They have debt maturing in the first half of 2018.  They will likely have to do a share issue, which will hurt the share price.-	The SEC has been asking them for information for years and Tesla has not complied with the requests.  This may impact their ability to raise capital.For another opinion on why Tesla cannot survive, read this comment from Vilas Capital fund manager John Thompson (whose fund generated a 65% return in 2017) from earlier this week:Tesla cannot survive the next 12 months without access to capital from Wall Street Banks or private investors. We estimate that Tesla will need roughly $8 billion in the next 18 months to fund operating losses, capital expenditures, debts coming due, and working capital needs. However, it appears that due to past SEC investigations and current investigations (which terrifyingly have not been disclosed by the company), it will likely be difficult for Tesla to access public markets. According to a recent analyst report, there have been 85 SEC requests for additional information and disclosures in the last 5 years. This compares to Ford Motor Company's total of zero over the same time frame. This means that Tesla is pushing many, many boundaries. When a company is under formal investigation, it is difficult, if not impossible, to raise capital from public markets as these investigations must be made public, which generally craters the equity and debt values. Therefore, Tesla investors better hope there are a number of Greater Fools in China or elsewhere to keep the company solvent. At some point, the music stops, and there aren't any open chairs. No matter how good a social investment makes you feel as it is going up, extreme anger will result if most or all of your money is permanently lost, especially when it is due to false and misleading statements by senior company officers. This is when the DOJ steps in and escorts untruthful managements to their new living quarters.Having great products and having a great business are unfortunately two very different things.  The list of companies with great products that went broke is very long.  Unfortunately for Tesla longs, I think they will be reminded of this lesson in 2018.",
"Curious that one of the headings in this article is ""Bottom Line"" considering the willful ignorance of that by Tesla longs.",
"There are many good reasons why bears continue to remain short Tesla stock. Most bears do not disregard the amazing progress Elon Musk has made to build Tesla into a successful car manufacturer. They do not hate Tesla or wish the company goes bankrupt. Bears simply recognize that even if:  1. Model 3 production ramps up and the Model 3's are profitable to make.   2. Models S and X sales grow   3. Tesla side businesses become profitableEven if everything goes right for Tesla, the stock is still  overvalued. The current market cap of $56 billion means investors are banking on Tesla reaching positive cash flow of $4.5 billion or so very soon. That would be a reasonable multiple for a car manufacturer. Analysts from respected, professional investment firms such as Morningstar, Cowen and others look at Tesla rationally and assign a target price under $200 for the stock. Jim Chanos, a highly-successful professional short seller, assigns a value of $0 to Tesla common stock. I hope most short sellers are aware of the volatility and ""Musk aura"" boost inherent in Tesla's stock. As a long-time investor I stick mostly to conservative, value-oriented stocks. But I look at a small short position in Tesla as a pretty good risk-reward hedge investment and I am willing to sit with it for years if need be. I think at some point within the next two years that Tesla stock will move to a valuation that is more realistic -- and I do not mean to the upside.The biggest risk for bears that I can see is if an Asian investment fund like Softbank goes haywire and makes a huge private placement investment in Tesla. That could keep Tesla stock aloft for a long time.",
"""Continue to execute on its Model 3 Production plan""6 months behind schedule and 40% over promised price point is now 'continuing to execute?' That is a low, low bar you hold your favorite company to. I'll bet you dollars to donuts on that profitability 2H18, Value. When I was a Tesla long I maintained that Tesla would justify its market cap if it was able to execute its Model 3 plan. 5000 Model 3s a week in 2017, for $35,000. I said they'd earn another capital raise if they were able to do that and even break even. As time went on, I saw more and more warning signs, and I sold my position. Well short of its crazy $380 peak, of course, but it was the right decision at the time. They have completely, utterly botched the Model 3 rollout. They are losing torrents of money trying to get it up to speed. I genuinely doubt their ability to sell the car for $35k in a timely manner. At the end of the day, GM will have beat them to the punch of a low-cost, long-range BEV by over a year. That kind of puts the lie to Tesla's competitive advantages, doesn't it?",
"Tsla grew sales from 4B to 7B in 1 year, 2015-2016.http://bit.ly/2shGvc9Losses stayed around 800M$ / yr.Tsla likely had about 11-12B in 2017 turnover, TBD, once data is in for 2017.About 20-24B in likely sales for the FY 2018, probable sales, given 200-250k Model 3 sales and deliveries. The large range of 4B has to do with energy (1-2B variance) and Model 3 stuff (1-2B as well).Many times 2 B has been pointed out as the cost of a new car factory for Big Auto etc.Tsla has already spent about that for the Model 3 line 1, partly line 2, and partly paint and sheetmetal stamping presses for both lines 1 and 2. Probably tsla has spent a bit more.My point:*Most* of the big heavy spending for the Model 3 line 1, and a big part for line 2, is already paid for, installed, and being debugged.In 2017, Tsla probably spent about 3B$, on auto + battery stuff.To grow from 7B$/yr to 20 B$ / yr in potential sales in 2018.The cost at 3B$ for 10-12-14B$ extra revenue, is extremely efficient in terms of capital allocation.Typical numbers are 1-1.5$ capex / dollar of revenue.We can easily add another 3B$ for tsla capex + opex (centers for sales and service, globally, superchargers) in 2018, to realise the 20B$+ revenue stream. Yes.So, yes, it is likely tsla will still spend another 3B in 2018, to get to 20-24B$ in revenue in 2018.But most of that money (3B in 2018) will support growth to 30-40B in revenue in the 2019-2020 timeframes.And it is likely another 5-7-9B total (4.5 B$/yr) will be spent in 2018-2020, to fund several (2-3) new factories in china, EU, etc. for cars, batteries, etc.So yes, 2018-2020 it is likely tsla will spend 3B/2018+3B/2018 (new factories)+7-9B (global factories) == 15 B$ by YE 2020.But the end result will be revenues of ..2018 - 20 B$ (24 B)2019 - 30 B$2020 - 40 B$The operating margin == 15% on 90B, or == 14B$ for 3 years 2018-2020.So tsla is likely to lose 1B$ in cash 2018-2020, while growing revenues 600% from 7B in 2016 to 40B in 2020, perhaps more (energy, new car models coming around 2020, etc.)If the tsla SP stays the same multiple on revenue as 1/2018 or now, 600% in sales revenue (40B$) x 300$ == 1800$ / share.This, I feel, is very unlikely.Yet multiple companies like berkshire, amazon, msft, did so on real revenues, products, execution.Tsla has real major risks, yet, on black swan events.-On regulation.-On technological events like self driving sw going open-source, or lidar, or commodity batteries.-Bad luck like major accidents widely publicised.But every year tsla adds top-tier experts onto their R&D team, 50% +/-,every year they have much more experience and people,and global reach and global sales spreading risks.",

The fact that the company is burning cash with no chance of profitability anytime soon AND has such massive debt bodes extremely poorly for the Tesla fan club.

"In the twenty minutes or so it took me to read the superficial article and many comments, Tesla burned through another $160,000. With the burn rate being over $150 Million a month, and $2 Billion of capex and $1 Billion of debt coming due, just for 2018, there is a strong fundamental case for being short the stock. What does Tesla lead in? Well, the Fremont plant has the highest cost for Labor of any plant in the US; the most workers per car produced; the largest loss per car produced for any auto plant in the world. Name a single plant that loses more money? I bet you can't.And face facts: The Fremont plant is pretty close to being maxed out, capacity wise.New factories cost $2+Billion to build and equip, and take several years.If Tesla leads in self driving AP, why then is Waymo ahead with self driving taxis in Phoenix? Remember, Waymo is backed by Google which that has more capital access than pretty much the entire global auto industry. And then there is Apple and Intel spending R&D on AP.If Tesla leads in energy storage, why then are they losing money delivering their systems? What happened to the Powerwall 1 and 2? Sales yes, but no profits.If Tesla leads in solar roofs, why then is SolarCity laying off thousands of people? Why has there not been a single Tesla Tile roof identified in public?The only profitable line of business Tesla has is ZEV credits, and as more OEMs sell their own EV cars and have no need to buy Tesla's excess credits, what do you think will happen to that revenue stream? By 2021 there will be something like 120 EVs brought to market.ZEV credits will go the way of Kodak film in 5 years.The only facts that would likely change my opinion about the profitability of Tesla is if they could raise $10 Billion from stock sales, and not break below $300 a share.$5 Billion is probably not enough to get them through 2018. (Negative cash flow, capex, and funding needed to work on Semis, roofs, Y, and get M3 production up to 5,000 a week).An extra $10B, not from debt, yes I would cover and look to short at higher prices.",
"These Bullish articles are always short on data points to outline specifics on calculation of forecasted revenue vs costs, and a cash flow analysis.

Tesla’s Feb earnings report will be ugly.  If they are so far off on deliveries then Revenue will be well down, however I expect you’ll see a continuation, if not increase, on expenses for the quarter.   Net net = another ugly burn cash, miss revenue expectations quarter.However, with all that said, I don’t think you’ll see a major longer term trend downward, but a shorter term dip again.  I don’t see the bullish sentiment waning until Tesla runs into debt financing issues, and looks to potentially use stock equity to raise capital.",

"You are certainly right that each $1/gallon in the price of gasoline increases the expected savings from driving an EV.  You may have addressed the question “how much” in an earlier column, but as you don’t here (even though you do include a graph showing the increase in the price of a barrel of crude), I thought I’d add this comment:  First, let’s make sense of the graph.  It shows us that the price of oil has increased about 20 dollars per barrel since last July.  That’s about 50 cents per gallon, so let’s use that for our computation of increased savings.  Further, let’s assume today you drive about 12,000 miles per year in a ICE car of about the same size as the M3, and therefore gets about 30 mpg.  If you made your decision last July to buy an M3, you should now increase your expected savings by just under $200/year.  If you play it that close, more power to you.  This assumes all other things stay the same.  One thing that doesn’t stay the same, though, is the cost of money.  If you borrow, say $30,000 to buy an M3, the increase in interest rates since July likely more than cancels your additional savings from the increase in the cost of gas.  If only you could have gotten your M3 then!And, though some think, as you do, that the price of oil will continue to rise, and some don’t – but almost everyone agrees that in the next year interest rates will rise.  The way I see it, the net savings continues to drop, at least for the next year.",

"The Model 3 is truly a stunning car and has without a doubt raised the bar for the whole industry to follow.

The minimalistic interior hides the plethora of technology and features that are packed into this car, and just like the S and X, the Model 3 just gets better with every software update, something that no other car can do. The Model 3 competes directly with BMW's and Audi's, but cost savings will also draw buyers from the Civic and Corolla crowds as well, possibly making the Model 3 the best selling car of all time, certainly the most significant car since the Model T, and from what I've seen, the Model 3 is going to be the benchmark car that competitors will have a tough time to beat in both price and performance.

I don't know if this is accurate, but it has been common wisdom on WS for a very long time.Even a cursory look at the condition of TSLA's business and the mis-statements of future progress by Musk, lends many investors to feel more comfortable on the short side.  Nobody can debate that TSLA's Balance Sheet is a disaster.  For instance, Gross Margin (which is the 'rock' many TSLA Bulls have cited as being in good shape) is 20.3%.  Apparently, the Gross Margin percentage boils down to a Net Income figure of (1.40B) negative.  Obviously, GM doesn't mean much when Net Income is under water by almost $1.5B.  Even Net Operating Cash Flow is under water, (1.01B) negative.Author's pretending that numbers on a Company's financial statements aren't impediments are being completely disingenuous.  WS evaluates companies based on the strength of the Balance Sheet and investors look at numbers and ratios to determine whether to buy or short a company's shares.Bullish articles are fine when they accurately depict the true condition of the company that's the subject of the article.

"I’m mad at Jon Wheeler for issuing this latest round of preferred shares. It just isn’t in the interest of common shareholders. The only thing calming me down right now is the thought of an investor who’s even madder: Joseph Stilwell. Stilwell is an activist investor who typically takes positions in undervalued small cap banks and ‘encourages’ them to sell, thereby unlocking their full value potential. Mr Stilwell began acquiring WHLR common about 6 months ago and currently owns 9.8%. He fully intends to gain board representation. Stilwell is in these shares at over $10, so he’s already lost 30% of his investment. Here’s my theory: Jon Wheeler saw what Stilwell was doing and realized ‘his’ company would be on the block with Stilwell getting involved. With the sale of Wheeler, there goes Jon’s name, position, and lucrative benefits (he’s way overpaid by the way, especially for how he’s run the commons into the ground!). So what does Jon Wheeler do? He issues WHLRD for $16.50 which has to be redeemed for $25 in the event of a change of control. Think about it, now the company can’t be sold! So Jon Wheeler just extended his job security by a couple years. Reprehensible! Just imagine when Stilwell kicks the front door in at Wheeler corporate headquarters!I’m with Owl, I think WHLRD is a good investment at this point, but Wheeler himself just bent over the common shareholders. The common dividend will need to be cut to pay the horrendous cost on the preferred. I think the yield to required redemption in 2023 is around 21%. Not in the commons interest....Sick ‘em Stilwell!!! I’m with you man!!!",
"In their Press Release regarding the contract on Janaf, I believe they failed to mention this center was supposed to close in April 2017, so they have taken another year and still not closed on the center.

Janaf isn't exactly a 'beautiful center' and, if memory serves me correctly, the owner of BJ's is looking to sell the BJ's portfolio. I guess time shall tell.",
"In any case common dividend is unsustainable. When the common dividend gets cut the preferred will take a huge dive as well since they are next. Best time to buy preferred is probably after the preferred dividend gets cut as well. At that point whatever earnings they have are still accruing to the preferred but the prices will be much better.WHLR preferred is not a yield investment, this is really a bet on survival. If they can deleverage with money saved from not paying dividends for a few years, the preferred will have value. It will be like the Supertel/CDOR scenario.@Owl, I noticed that you seem to be consistently too early.",

"A Chapter 11 restructuring eliminates all promises to all preferred holders.  In my opinion, 2023 would necessitate such a filing if it doesn't happen sooner.Bankruptcy law assumes that management ""represents"" the interests of all equity holders, so common & preferred holders get no voice in the process, and no vote on the restructuring, since the court can assume that they vote no.Secured debt either votes yes, or takes their security.  Unsecured debt may get a significant equity slice.Management gets their regular salary, plus retention bonuses, plus equity.  Preferred holders should get some equity crumbs.",
"OldTimeREITster, a very forthright article articulating the negative case on Wheeler.  Even if I am on the other side, very well done.OK, you were likely referring to me and my article in your comment here:""From reviewing the comments on Seeking Alpha, it looks as though some fans of the Wheeler Preferred believe the Mandatory Redemption for Asset Coverage will protect their investment in the event Wheeler continues to have difficulty. The question these investors need to ask themselves is if WHLR ends up needing to impair assets because of a bankruptcy filing by Southeastern Grocers or some other event and violates the Asset Coverage Test where is WHLR going to get the cash to redeem your preferred. Chances are it would be impossible to conduct an equity offering after a negative event that would trigger a violation of Coverage Test.""So, you may well imagine that I did not wait to ask ""the question"" but worked that out prior to my investing one penny.  Events such as this with Wheeler should not be surprising anyone who is actually in the name, given their developing track record.While I am not sure that I would describe myself as a fan of WHLRD (or any of my holdings as they are all distressed), I feel that WHLRD is representing value over the long run, even if it is off to a rocky start on day three after my article.  It would have happened sooner or later.So where will Wheeler get the cash, you ask?  As an owner of the Preferred, with all due respect, that is not my problem.  That is the common equity owners problem and, as I wrote in my article, I believe that this is not a problem that they should overlook.Keeping in mind that the covenant does not kick in until Sept 2023, if I read the prospectus correctly, on Sept 21st, 2023, I will show up at their payment window with shares in hand if there are insufficient assets, putting the stock back to Wheeler.  If they have insufficient cash, they will be in default.  Likely scenario, the D Shares and the ""pari passu"" B shares and other shares (whatever they are called) will become the new equity owners with the current equity owners being relegated to very low recovery if not zero.  This is not optional for them if the asset coverage is not in place.If it is in place, they still have a problem, needing to up the dividend rate by 2% per year unless they redeem the shares anyway.Regardless of whether they have assets in place or not, they really need to redeem those shares in Sept 2023 or deal with increasingly punitive terms.  This is why I was astounded that they did not finance with B Shares (or a new series that did not have what is in effect a maturity date and other protections).  Be that as it may, we now have a boatload more D shares outstanding that have been issued and Wheeler will need to deal with not just the original D Shares but the new D shares as well, as will the common shareholders.  Indeed, it will be their problem first.So, in buying too early and paying $19.33, I will get back $11.21 in dividends prior to that point or 58% of my money.  I will then either get back $25, be paid ever higher dividends or will own the new equity in a recapitalized Wheeler at that point.  No guarantees, but I think that the D Shares are a much better deal than people give them credit for with no credit going to the Wheeler management team.  The preferreds look to me to be the fulcrum security in this name.Good prices and good news seldom come together.  You need to absorb some bad news to get discounted, good prices.  Wheeler is no exception................",

"This 18% increase in WHLR's asset size, financed at a cost about equal to the net return from the purchase, is a major step toward a Chapter 11 that will benefit management at the expense of common holders.  Common gets wiped out, preferred gets converted to common, and management gets ""retention"" bonuses and equity in a reorganized REIT that finally might be large enough to be viable.  All preferred holders will probably get something, but it will be a lot less than they are expecting.",Wheeler REIT: Preferred Offering And CFO Resignation Signal Absolute Desperation

"Jeremy, The high EBITDA margin on the Elite deal is correct. It has to do with the way the deal was structured.  Nobilis took on the marketing network costs which are already built in to their existing cost structure while the other minority owner carries other burdens such as wages. I have verified this with the Nobilis Investor Relations, and they claim that number to be correct. They are looking for an automatic 15 Million EBITDA gain for 2018 on this deal alone, so far the market hasn't given them anything for this deal or other deals that closed in 2017, in fact we lost 60% of our value over that same period!!",

The fair sized short position that accompanied this stock to the bottom has dwindled steadily this past quarter to 3% from well over 10% at one point. A small rally could squeeze these remaining shorts out as there really isn't a downside at these prices especially when you consider the low valuation referred to in this article.

Great article. So undervalued considering the earnings and relatively low risk business.,

"Great article and I loaded up on HLTH once I dug into their business.  This has huge potential given the changes in healthcare right now and the types of patients they are targeting.  This is not a bloated, costly hospital.  Their facilities and physicians focus on profitable treatments and the commercially insured.  Moreover, HLTH is making strong moves to boost in-network volumes by expanding and acquiring practices.  ALl the key metrics are improving including margins per case and revenue per case.  They have demonstrated progress in fixing the costs issues that hurt them all last year.  I see a ton of value going forward at this price.  The only issue is the market that does not get their model and that is definitely a concern for upside, but as long as earnings in coming quarters prove successful then I see a great 2018 for the stock.",
Thanks for the information! Good points you’re mentioning!,
"This is such an undervalued company. It's just terrible that no one is realizing this.

"Good article. Thanks for the insight.You can extrapolate to other industries and how they can be more aggressive in improving their businesses, whether through advertising, product development or plant expansion.

"I have to repeat what I said to one of my friends after the election. ""I want to buy stocks that do not force me to check Twitter at 3 am"" Indeed, FB (and GOOG, etc) will be indirect beneficiaries of tax reform but in some cases, these companies MAY have to pay higher taxes (I believe FB's taxes is/was around 12%). Also, FB is a stock that you do not really buy because of tax cuts but because of it's potential to become the favorite payment method worldwide or to become the main player in VR/AR just to mention some non-advertising opportunities. With that being said, I want to congratulate the author on his thesis.",

Good article - I was thinking the same thing thinkinthethe sa,
Good detective work. Keep listening and keep us posted on how they are spending their tax gains.,
FB but not GOOGLE?!,
Excellent article - FB going to $208 and beyond.  Long and strong FB.,
Bought in @ 22 . Adding more at this point I am that confident.,
"Yes, it’s actually quite obvious that advertising budgets will increase and that FB will be one of, if not the most obvious beneficiary. Additionally, about 40% of FB’s profits are derived from the US. The tax benefits appear not to have not been factored in as the trailing PE has steadily declined over the past year. FB’s ad prices increased 35% YOY last quarter. This matrix alone translates into a minimum of 40+% (probably will be close to 50%) top line growth for the next two quarters not factoring in any increase in ad spending cited in this article. FB’s stock has been held down because of regulatory rumors that will likely not have a material long term impact. Therefore, FB presents and especially unusual opportunity in a otherwise fully priced market.",

"Who won CES: NvidiaRather than a breakout startup or one gadget that blew the show floor away, the talk of the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show were the mishaps of the show—the failed demonstrations, the flooding of Vegas and the subsequent power outages in one of the main halls.But in the background, one company solidified itself as a stalwart contender for winning the year: Nvidia. The company announced that it had a new chip custom-built for self-driving cars, and that it was working with more than 320 partners who would use the technology to power their vehicles. It also announced a gaming monitor the size of a television, creating a new class of large-screen devices with the refresh speed required for professional gaming.These new pieces of hardware represent new areas of growth in two of the company’s most important revenue streams, gaming and automotive. While the company was built on gaming hardware, CEO Jensen Huang projects automotive chips as a huge area for future growth. In the next year or so, Huang expects that the bulk of chips used for self-driving cars will be put into datacenters to simulate how the cars will drive, followed by then selling the in-car chips as consumers and enterprise customers actually purchase autonomous vehicles.http://bit.ly/2r9Flk7<<>>OK folks, while much hullaballoo has been made about QNX and NVDA please note that the above article clearly states NVDA has and is working with 320 partners in self driving cars.320!The good news for BB and why I recently made some nice profits off of a long play is that self driving/autonomous vehicles is a very hot and glamorous sector. But the reality is there will be little revenues for BB in the near to mid term future in this segment. But the market and especially the tech sector is fueled on hype and future possibilities and BB is in this particular niche so with their PR department working overtime along with REALALOY there could definitely be more upside coming.",

BBM was the best video messaging system while on all the pure BB Operating Systems but it wasn't available on Android or iOS. In fact I had never even bothered trialling it on the BlackBerry Priv or the Motion until while reading in this thread I found it was actually operational. One of Chen's biggest failings was in failing to inform the general public that it was available. Unlike Google's Hangouts video it doesn't have a very discernible time lag between voice and video which made Hangouts look like a badly dubbed film. Unlike the Apple messaging system it was not a data/battery hog.My wife and I checked the video calling earlier today and I can report it is as good as it ever was.,

So, MNK stock trades for roughly 3X adjusted earnings.  Clearly, the stock is an ""ugly duckling"", trading at a huge discount.  My take is that MNK will probably muddle through, and the stock price can recover over time if management can keep the business basically on track.

When Crypto stablizes  and PYPL embbed them into the platform (paying with crtpto) it will be great for them in the long haul imho,
"They say that Ripple can transfer inter bank funds in seconds.So can Paypal. Without having to change twice into another ""currency"". But the thing is. US banks have deliberately slowed down most of their transfers, because banks benefit from slower transactions, both from double checks and interest rates that start ticking later for the end user than the banks.All the hype about transaction speed is a fad. In Sweden. All of the major banks have instant inter bank transfers. Like sending an email. Without intermediates and without cryptos. They say that Ripple can skip the middle man, but in reality Ripple is just another middle man. If Ripple is a success ? it will be because of a positive marketing, good sales people at Ripple and a US bank sector that actively delays transfer speeds, and not because its a needed platform. Perhaps Ripple has a ""use case"" in Countries without ordinary banks ? ( like the South Pole ) but that is not the desired environment that Ripple is looking for.This holds true for all cryptos that claim to be a currency or a transfer service.The only sector where distributed ledgers can increase safety and speed, is in ""smart contracts"" like land ownership, copyrights etc. but for a pure transaction where simplification and speed is needed the distributed ledger is a fiasco and will always be a joke. It took 10 years for the btc community to admit this and the same thing will happen to all cryptos aimed at ""transfers"". They won't be used for the intended purpose but as commodities. Aka. This leaves Paypal and cryptos in totally different markets. Forever.",

GOOGL has the clearly superior growth arc--although I think that the market may be underestimating Azure's growth potential--and MSFT has the nice dividend.

"Renn looks great in first glance you will found it has some valuable asset. But I use technical analysis, I found it does not have any technical support price, the previous stock owner keep selling their stock without any hesitation, so I did not buy Renn stock, just watching. I realized it is just a falling knife after it drooped below $11 It could not drop so much if there are someone buying it. Renn's fundamental is not good either, $9 per share asset, need to deduct debt and bad asset turns out only $6. But Renn keep losing a lot money per year, the asset will keep decreasing, it will decrease from $6 in 2017 to $0 in next 4 or 5 years.Stay away Renn.",
"If you ask 100 Chinese, it will be only 1 person using Renn occasionally, 99 person using Alibaba or Tecent daily. Buy Alibaba or Tecent instead of dead company Renn.",
"Renn's management want to pump the price so they said they will have ICO. But the short life hyper only let the previous stock owner rush to out with huge profit 300% in less than one year. Renn is lack of institution investor or other type long term investor, the price of Renn will keep drift down until it hit support price $6.Renn's asset is not $18, it is $9, but you need to deduct its debt and some bad asset, it turns out only $6 with dead Renn Chinese business.",
"There is a reason why RENN management is keeping this stock down while insiders owning majority of this stock. Either they are planning a buyout (taking this private) with minimal premium, while RENN stake (other investment) alone is worth close to 18$/share (IMO is should be higher given these increased interest for SoFi and other platform driven apps",
"The current price is $10.10, RENN has dropped too much, it means the previous owner has all chosen to sell their stock and no new big buyer take shares. RENN is dead, it will down to the previous price range $6 - $10.Stay away RENN, Do not buy it.",
"The current price for RENN is $10.5, this is a good price, RENN is extremely over sold, but you need be patient, waiting for the end of Feb. You can buy RENN after Feb 20, you will enjoy a short run with 30% return in two months.",
The best buying opportunity for Renn is at the end of Feb. The bottom will form and the Q4 result will be out soon and block chain involvement detail will be out.,
"Perfect, The exact answer I was looking for. If the market didn't account for social media business, there is always upside potential starting at zero valuation, and there exist an opportunity for their re-vamping effort. Even the cab rental website for redirecting, small business opportunity tapping their user network or as a blog can even generate revenue. If the share price did not account for any upside from core social media business. I know there should be some valuation changes soon. Still in. Always love to invest in holding companies, where risk spread is always managed.",
"Based on SEC supervision of the calculation of the dividend amount, RENN has no other choice than be fair because the SEC has asked for a detailed valuation of each stake.",
"interesting analysis but just some additionnal information on SNOWBALLAccording to an interview of the founder of Snowball Finance in September 2014, the valuation of Snowball has exceeded 500 million dollars (in Sept 2014). I suspect the valuation to be currently more than 1bn$ so RENN stake is more than 250m$",
"Feel huge selling pressure on Jan 12, Renn will drop to $10.8, $10.8 is a good price to start initial position.",
"Baidu into blockchain as well. As more and more services are offered, RENN set to realize short term upside for new SaaS offered through blockchain platform.",
"The daily trading volume for Renn is too high, Renn is a small cap, only 13M share can be traded. The normal trading volume must be under 0.5M, otherwise it still face huge selling pressure.",
"I don't believe in RENN future plans, but do believe in SoFi to grow by 10B shortly after IPO soon. That alone with US Trucker Path have good prospect in logistics and financial platform. Hope they learned something from their failed past social platform and could bring some value to core RENN platform apps besides their investment in SoFi and logistics ventures. Had to agree on their valuation and potential to pop to 18$",
"The strategic positioning of the company is strange.Renn is already an ""investment company"". It's main business is live broadcast and second-hand car businiess. The competition in these industries are very fierce, and it's hard to make a profit. So they  invest  in a variety of small businesses to keep the company vitality. I wonder if they know exactly what they want to do.So in 3~4 days, this stock rose by 70%, and then fell back. They didn't  evaluted the legitimacy of ICO, or just want to make money in the stock market in the short run.So I don't think they have a long-term plan to do good perfermance.If you don't know it's business in China(the base value of the stock,not the Sofi), it's better to stay away from this stock.",

"There are a lot of selling pressure from previous stock owner who has more than 60% profit, this stock need stay in $12 range for one or two months to absorb those selling pressure, then it will have huge run to $18 in March.",

The buying opportunity will be the daily trading volume less than 0.5M, this means it is on the bottom and everyone don't want to sell it.Renn has huge potential but you need be patient, waiting for the trading volume is less than 0.5M shares/per day.",
"Renn has only 13M shares out for trading, but the volume is 2-3M per day, it means the buyer are for short time profit. It is very safe to buy Renn if Renn can drop to $11.5.",
"To me, RENN is still in the penalty box.  It missed its original mission in social media by a mile and may repeat in blockchain.  Something seems to be amiss in their C-suite.  How else can they mess up their ICO (Initial Coin Offering) so royally, failing to get PRC approval first.  Cart before the horse comes to mind.

"Started reading the prospectus. Everything looked solid until I got to the ownership post IPO. Instead of a nice clean ownership structure there is a confusing mix of Class B and Class A stock. It turns out the underlying LBRT operating company (eg Liberty Oilfield Services NewHoldCo) will be owned by two entities. The first is ""Liberty Oilfield Services Inc"", which is LBRT stockholders, and they will own 57% of the underlying operating company. The second entity is Riverstone, who will own 43% of the underlying operating company via ""LLC Units"". Unfortunately, Riverstone also ends up controlling LBRT via receiving one Class B common share in LBRT for each LLC unit they own. The Class B share has no economic rights but do have voting rights identical to Class A shareholders. Riverstone also owns some Class A shares. Bottom line Riverstone end up with 49% of the voting stock in LBRT. So they end up being able to control the company while not actually owning much of the stock. There are provisions for converting Riverstone's LLC Units into Class A shares. When those units get converted to LBRT shares, Riverstone gets paid 85% of the tax benefits (got complicated and I did not take the time to figure out what it all meant in dollar terms). It was difficult to figure out, but these types of arrangements typically exist to fleece the Class A stockholders. Is the complicated ownership structure bad for investors? Given Riverstone's control of LBRT but lack of economic ownership, how big a conflict of interest are we looking at here? To what degree could LBRT's financial decisions by Riverstone benefit Riverstone at the expense of the Class A stockholders?Until I hit that part of the prospectus, LBRT was looking very strong. Seems unlikely to me Riverstone would pursue such a complicated ownership structure if there was not some large financial incentive to them that would be detrimental to the Class A stockholders. But I have to say I do not really understand the situation and it could be entirely benign. Would appreciate any help here you could provide.",

So it isn't the original reason for its present bargain price. My analysis is this is due to Amazon becoming the leader in Internet sales in Japan then.Rakuten is building a network, but more physical than Amazon's cloud. The latter is where high growth and money is now. I think this is what the market dislikes. So the big question is, will Rakuten succeed to keep momentum while Amazon steamrolls Japan, like in the US? To answer this, answers if it is a bargain or a value trap.Just as Google took over Yahoo, even though the latter had some diversification, which wasn't enough to save it.

I wonder what is your opinion on the recent news that the company wants to enter the telco space which is extremely competitive and dominated by 3 carriers already . since entering this space is extremely capital intensive i can see a reason why investors are dumping the stock. also it seems that every year the CEO comes up with a new market to compete in which seems to be confusing for investors to what the strategy really is for the company.also the company stated that it will need to raise around 5.35 billion dollars in debt to build the infrastructure . which is nearly 40% of there equity . the company on the one hand is buying back stock on the other hand it needs massive capital to expand.i can see the reason to why the stock trades at a low discount and is far off from the sum of the parts valuation.,

It's at the top of my watch list and I am definitely going to do some heavy research into the company.A few questions:Do you have any statistics on Rakuten's profit margin? Besides the company's own reports, where is the best place to find detailed information on Rakuten's fundamentals?

Does the company try to specifically target Japanese-Americans or from you can tell are they trying to break into the general online retail market?You mentioned that Japan in general has lower household debt relative to the West, but in regards to its credit card division what is Rakuten's target customer? Do they only target prime borrowers or do more risky sub-prime borrowers also comprise their credit pool? Essentially, I try to do as much due diligence as possible in any financial related sector after what happened during the financial crisis in 2008, and I'm always leery that companies hide potentially risky assets without investors knowing.Thank you once again for this great insight.

Japan is a highly developed nation with an aging population as you mentioned. Rakuten has to look for growth in a market that is shrinking where as BABA and AMZN are expanding in growing markets with increasing spending per capita.One thing to keep in mind about Japan and its culture - moving there for temporary work is okay but full-on immigration by people of non-Japanese descent is highly discouraged by both the people and the government. Japan's current demographic make up is about 98.5% Japanese, 1.4% other east Asians, and less than .1% other races. I personally think Japan's economy would benefit greatly from moderate immigration but that'll not happen until the Japanese (perhaps their millennial generation) become more accepting on immigrants.",

Valuable comment.,
"I just had a difficult situation with Synchrony in trying to open a $25k CD online. Everything was fine until I got to the point where it didn't recognize my phone number in order to get a special code number which would confirm my account. We were having a little difficulty because I don't have a land line. I use Ooma. So, I gave the customer agent either of my two smart phone numbers to return the call so that the code number could be verified. He was supposed to call me back on my Ooma number. He never called back. I decided to wait a while until he called back even on one of my smartphones. After 15 minutes, I called their general phone number. I asked the person to be connected to the agent who was servicing me. The agent said she would send him an immediate note to return my call. Again, I waited a long while, so I called again. I asked to be connected to the same agent who was servicing me. I asked what had happened to him. She said he was on break which could last an hour or so. Well, I was disappointed that the agent with whom I opened the account could leave in the middle of my opening the account. I told the customer agent, he could have left me a message that he was taking a break. I complained that it was not the proper thing to do to leave me in a lurch waiting and waiting and having to call back 3-4 times to try to establish the account. Well, I get fed up with this entire situation, so I cancelled the account. This was too much to have had their agent leave me waiting with no return calls from him. I filed a complaint with his supervisor. Had I known that Synchrony had over 800 complaints filed with the Better Business Bureau, I would have thought twice about doing business with them. As I'm writing this, I decided to check the BBB again. I was not surprised that another customer wrote a lengthy complaint on Jan. 8, 2018 complaining about virtually the same thing that I had experienced. I'm going to be responding to this complaint confirming my own experience. I told his supervisor that their agent needs more training in performing customer service. I never experienced opening up several online accounts with other major financial institutions. Something is amiss with Synchrony. The complaints with the BBB may not fully list many other complaints as many people don't bother to register complaints, so I think that the 800+ numbers listed may be a drop in the bucket. I decided to write about my harrowing experience with Synchrony because it's not anecdotal. They really need to setup a better way of opening accounts. I had thought about investing in their shares, but I've decided to back away.",

This may happen later in they year assuming a higher gold price -- > $1750 / 1800 CAD.  This would offset the lower expected grades to a great extent.  As noted, Klondex rushed the decision, ignored previous developed resources, and tried to develop new higher grade potential 710/711 regions and produce at the same time using outside contractors to boot.   So the mining contractors they hired were not actually that good and were forced to meet goals that required more preparation and narrow vein skill.",

I agree.  A good number of their investors and others in the community already knew for some time that True North operations did not make sense at recent gold prices.  It was really over recent history the company was making a serious error in running down an unprofitable road.  KDX should have made this move earlier.   Gold will move up and it makes a lot of sense to hold on to such deposits until the operation makes some sense.  ESPECIALLY for a company which has other profitable operations with which to work.,

"So your defense is: Make misleading statements, admit statements might be untrue/misleading but then come to conclusions based on those untrue statements?Strange logic.",
"Mr. Tyumin, your thesis fails for four reasons (maybe more, I stopped looking):1.	Comparison of Private Student Loans (PSLs) to FFELP loans. PSLs are underwritten to a high standard which can include: co-borrower, FICO score and educational experience; FFELP loans are not. Including default rates of FFELP loans in a discussion of PSLs is asinine as there is absolutely no correlation between the two. Career prospects for graduates of my local community college are poor; does that translate in any way to career prospects of Ivy League school graduates?2.	Suggesting that Smart Option Loans, not yet in repayment, is a source of concern. Generally, full time students do not have a source of income – which is why P&I payments are deferred on all student loans. Some SLM borrowers elect to make a de minimis $25 per month payment. SLM offers this “option” so that borrowers understand their future monthly obligation. These payments (or non-payments) have little impact on future defaults. $25 x 12 (months per year) x 4 (years of college) is only $1,200. SLM has been in the Education finance business for a long time. They have years of data to project with reasonable certainty exactly what will happen when student graduates and full payment of P&I begins. Do not extrapolate your ignorance of history onto SLM.3.	Suggesting that increased TDR loans are a concern. SLM started, post spin, with zero TDR loans. All credit impaired loans were kept by Navient. Student Loans are unique in that since P&I payments aren’t due until a student graduates; a credit event can’t occur until the student graduates (or drops out). When you start with zero - doubling or tripling is easy. Management has been very clear that TDRs (and defaults) are abnormally low and future quarterly increases to the mean are simply an adjustment to a normal process when more loans enter full repayment.4.	Comparison to Navient. Until recently, when NAVI bought Earnest, the company was in run-off mode. NAVI’s earnings were irrelevant compared to the FFELP portfolio value less legal liabilities. To suggest that SLM would trade at a comparable P/E to NAVI is lunacy based on current business models. SLM will underwrite/fund $6+ Billion in new PSLs this year. NAVI, through Earnest, might refinance $2 Billion FFELP loans but still end the year with significantly less FFELP loans on their books. These are two completely different companies on completely different tracks.",

An error of this magnitude is already enough to invalidate the thesis as presented.The article also talks about a high Price/Tangible Book multiple, but completely omits the fact that the fair value of the company's loan book is much higher than its book value, as any reader of the company's latest 10-Q can easily discover (Note 9, Fair Value Measurements).

I felt, this is a marketplace to be watched and I am going to buy some shares. I would not be surprised if they do very well. It helps to have personal experience with the organisation, to understand the concept. I am buying Alibaba shares on the next dip.",
"Have to agree with the comments on not discussing large parts of BABA's business model. However, like Amazon, BABA is hugely complex. It is so complex (and somewhat opaque) that I kind of doubt really deep due diligence will work very well. Personally I look at it as a macro bet.From a macro level perspective, BABA is a two sided platform with huge moats. In addition to the a multi-sided platform moat, they also have a moat from a cultural perspective (language, in-country logistics, payment platform, etc) and from a government perspective (my sense is the Chinese government will not allow companies like Amazon or EBay to gain a footfhold in China, but it would sure be nice to get an analysis of that aspect). We have seen the multi-sided moats at work for years in the US with Amazon, Google, and other s. They are huge advantages. The other macro aspect of BABA is that China is becoming the largest ecommerce market in the world. And that huge market continues to grow rapidly from three key drivers. The first is the continued growth in per capita GDP is adding huge numbers of people to their middle and upper classes (eg lots of discretionary income, smart phones, internet connections). So every year BABA gains large numbers of new customers. The second is those customers are spending more on ecommerce per capita every year. The third is Chinese are much more inclined to use the internet and ecommerce to buy things than a lot of western countries. So every year you get - (more customers) X (more $ per customer) X (greater ecommerce penetration). It would be great to get an in-depth analysis of those and similar factors with a 3 year projection. Some analysts see BABA's growth decelerating. But the last 3 years it has accelerated. I wonder if peak growth is actually a few years more into the future.There are some things I worry about with BABA:1. Government interference.2. Lack of focus on end-to-end service to the customer. Amazon spends a lot of money on creating an easy to use frictionless interface to their customer with extremely rapid and dependable delivery of goods. This does require a lot of infrastructure which costs money. But it provides a moat from both scale and technology which only very wealthy companies can provide and reduces risks from potential competitors displacing them. Will BABA be vulnerable to competitors who might go the Amazon route in this area?3. Honesty and integrity of management and financials. Chinese companies appear to have less regulatory oversight than American ones (not sure of that, just an impression) and there have been some folks that raised what look like credible questions around BABA on that aspect. That actually worries me quite a bit. If you have any views on those, would love to hear them.",
Pretty light analysis. You failed to mention also that AliPay (Ant Financial) is not directly in house but under a profit sharing agreement. I believe it is 37% of profits flow to BABA. Does anyone know specifics on when this profit is shared w/BABA? thx.,

"China's online retail space is still a small fraction on what Amazon's is in USD equivalent. And that's with its vast population.Conclusions --- It's still very early in the China online retail development, and Chinese may never replicate anything similar to the American consumer culture.China does things differently. For instance,it jumped from vinyl record music directly to CDs pretty much without reel-to-reel tape, 8 track tapes, and cassette tapes.Retail in China won't ape the west.",
"FFF: ""There are two main risks I want to point out before you invest your money into Alibaba. The first is its valuation. After everything we just discussed, it should be no surprise that you're going to have to pay a premium to get into this name. Alibaba's 52.3 P/E ratio currently reflects that.""Have you reviewed Altaba Holdings, Inc. (AABA)?AABA (a registered investment company) is BABA's 2nd largest shareholder (15%) and those shares make up approx 78% of their holdings.  AABA has been, for the most part, a tracking stock of BABA.However, their balance sheet also reflects an estimated tax of approx 35% which is being reflected in the market price .The new tax law will be reducing that 35% tax rate to at least 21% (possibly 8% depending on repatriation definitions).What's good for BABA is good for AABA, but BABA won't be tracking AABA if (WHEN) those new tax rates start being taken into a/c when pricing AABA.",

"With pass through ending, what is your opinion on earnings for 2018?  Is there any information on current usage  on Omidria since pass through ending. Thanks.",
This is one of the best value in Biotech IMO.  In Biotech patience is a requirement.,
"Seems like plenty of buying opportunities ahead. Namely drop on no passthrough for Omidria, and probable secondary, and times of no news.  I read on each biotech I follow how they can partner this, or do that, to avoid secondary, but it never happens, always dilutive. Buy on the drops and hold through 2019 for hopefully better days with OMS721 material progress and good news towards approval.",
Anybody have clue why it’s going down last couple of days with increased trading volume ? Any news came out on omridia pricing ?,
"Thanks for a very informative article, O Neil trader. I really enjoyed reading the clinical trial updates. I agree 100% with the assessments, not only with OMS721, but also with Omridia !! Right on !!The HSCT-TMA study update is very good piece of information !! I wasn’t very clear earlier. ThanksI traded in and out of OMER (because of Omridia) and always had a core position (because of OMS721). All through the process, I made some good money. I think, just one update on any of the phase 3 studies will propel OMER to new high...Happy investing!!",
"Most likely there are no updates on Omidria's price status because Omeros is still in a process of price discovery.  If pass through status were being continued (something Omeros was trying to get) we would have heard about it by now.  Since that has not occurred, Omeros is in a process of negotiating the price with their EXISTING customers.  That is a process that will take time and likely tie up most of their resources, making sales to new customers very difficult to impossible.I think we are in for a rocky couple of quarters as Omeros works its way through this price discovery process.  My guess is that it will take most of 2018 before they can get back to sales expansion mode.  All of this is normal and not a reason to beat down the company's stock.  But the big concern is the risk that Omeros will need to return to the capital markets and thus dilute current shareholders.  We don't have a picture yet on THAT point, so the stock needs to reflect that risk for the moment.",
What is the prevalence of HCT-TMA? If all goes well... what will success in this indication add to the market cap?,
"Also, considering the tiny increase in facility from the clueless bureaucrats at CMS, I'm sure repricing Omidria will be worse than the uncertainty.  As such they havent repriced it yet.  Hence no 8-K.  They are waiting on a few pieces of legislation to move forward before settling on the fate of Omidria's pricing.  Its a significant improvement statistically over epinephrine in many ways.  If they cut price it should be in response to the drug being made a standard of care used in every procedure.  Until such time they are working on revising crap regulations that screw doctors at ASCs and limit patient access to outcome improving advancements.",
"AAV only has about 5000 people in the US.  there are 200k IgA cases in the US.  Between 40-80k need treatment.  Another 200k in Europe.

After I did some DD, Ripple sounded like, due to its use by banks and investment firms, the only true crypto that could possibly still be around after the governments eventually try to control and tax these currencies.

"I’m not sure why your deep dive fails to mention the fact that practically no banks are using xrp, as interledger doesn’t require xrp to be used. Xrp the token must be separated from ripple the company. Buying xrp does NOT grant you an equity stake in ripple. Without banks using xrp, the value of a centralized and censorable currency, minted by a private company with the majority still held by said company  (aka xrp) in “escrow” (whatever that means), which was hyped to nosebleed territory and beyond by newcomers who have no idea what they’re buying and think it’s “cheap” because it’s 2 dollars a token; the value of that “currency” is far below the current staggering market valuation. Expect xrp to continue to fall, as insiders and whales continue to dump their stake, and as the market wakes up to insanely overvalued “currency.”",Ripple/XRP Deep Dive Part II: The Lawsuit

It has a pretty good chance of becoming a major player in this market and it should command a market cap of a few bil if that happens.",
"Alright Henrik, beauty call.Wish I had held. If their turn around plan is successfull, what kind of market cap could this company have?",
"From my calculations the sales are likely to be $150 million in 2018. PODD who is the most like for like competitor has a market cap of $5 billion and a p:s ratio of around 10 and Tandem has a market cap of $300m with a p:s ratio of just 2. Does anyone know the percentage of pump market attributed to each pump. From what I read it looks like the Tandem product is very popular with patients, suggesting they will grab market share, from MDT at least. Sounds crazy but that suggests PODD have about triple the market share but a far higher multiple. As someone who bought shares in 2012 when the market cap was $600 m I would think that the share price should go up several hundred% from here in the next couple of years. Am I missing something?",

When they say ""we have closed the offeing"" does that mean they have sold the entire amount of shares and fully diluted the shares? I mean are there 40 000 000 million shares outstanding in market now? Or the institutional clients of oppheimer are still holding and they are waiting for a better price to dump?",
As I posted earlier this company was just restructured just like a bankruptcy reorganization.

"First off, great article. I found this article as a diabetic looking for a new pump and came away wondering if I should invest. My largest concern/criticism is that you seem to have analyzed the company and not the product or its competitor. The biggest problem with the Tandem pump is that it isn't an artificial pancreas system while the main competitor Medtronic is. However, Tandem is working on this and does have patents on this type of system. That said they are not expected to put the update out until late 2018/early 2019 due to FDA red tape. On the other hand, Medtronic is experiencing supply chain issues due to 2017 hurricanes in Puerto Rico.I wouldn't expect the price to increase significantly until at least late 2018.",

Although I believe the product is superior to Medtronic, and the company is more in tune with what consumers want, I don't believe they have the management abilities. When they make changes at the top I'm back in. They suffer from brand/marketing problems.",

Now they have $24.2mil in cash at end of Q4, it means they burned $3.3 mil in cash during the quarter.  I know they had $10mil LT restricted cash at end of Q3 and I assume that is still there.  Did they get cash from any other sources?",

I like ADM and am long but my big concern is the political risk around ethanol.  Margin squeeze will be the least of their problems if the blending rules are rolled back. So far Iowa is holding off Texas politically but the drumbeat is there.  Any views on that issue?,
"Andrew, thank you for a helpful article. For you and the readers: I'm a former ADM shareholder, and it made it back to my watch list due to a more attractive valuation late in 2017. I remember the CEO expressed frustration a couple of years back about the ethanol business and they were evaluating whether to exit the business. Are they still in it because no buyer has surfaced?",

"Great article Andrew.  Thanks for sharing your thoughts on ADM.  In addition to ADM being a great time to invest in, I'd like to add that the dividend also appears to be very safe with a CCC rank by David Fish of about 57 and also a solid A dividend rank by Navellier.  You should consider going long also.",
"Agree with the opinions and figures,  the fundamentally bullish story in Ag is clear.  But I am not convinced on the timing as I think ADM is very long-term bull story but in a shorter time-frame covering the next several earnings reports I fear that ADM has some hefty barriers to overcome.  1. Industry over-capacity build-up has been well discussed as a driver to lower margins in previous earnings calls, but that problem has not addressed yet, which is specially impacting ADM that has a mostly US footprint relative to the ABCD group.  2. Political instability between the US - China relations is also a point to be attentive to as ADM is a big player in those Ag flows.  3. Most recently, new tax proposal on farm income generated from Coops could threaten their farmer purchasing volumes.  Would like more clarity on these points before making a statement of quick rebound.",

If they do step up, shareholders will suffer significant dilution in return for another three month lease on life. Sell this stock now and save what you can.''How about this one from last year?''Enphase will likely burn through $16 to $18 million in cash during Q2. It will need to raise an additional $25 million of equity capital before June 30th.''How about this one?''At the Q2 projected burn rate, ENPH would run out of cash during the second week of July. If ENPH is unable to attain the $75 million revenue target, the liquidity noose will be even tighter at June 30th.''How about this one?''Using assumptions provided by management, the cash flow model included above estimates that ENPH will burn more than $9 million in cash during Q3.''How about this one when the share price was 80 cents?''In my August 14th article I recommended avoiding ENPH.

Unfortunately, for those of us who think independently and are well-researched, your persuasion tactics are powerless; they cast you in a desperate light...Rewind to the Enphase Q3 Earnings Call:When asked if section 201 would affect the business, Raghu Belur answered that they didn’t think tariffs would impact the business in a meaningful way, that “the ACM is a worldwide sku, coupled with the fact that IQ7 is a worldwide product”. The company has aggressively shifted its business strategy to play in new, previously untapped global markets. So, in the short-term, while we may witness a pronounced market overreaction in the wake of harsh tariffs (which will immediately be opposed in WTO courts), I tend to agree with Belur- LONG-TERM, “We think the risk is low or manageable”. That said, I will be listening very intently to Q4 call, hopefully to hear some concrete numbers about how the ACM is fairing, as much of the future of Enphase is riding on its success.",

This firm doubled down on its EF acreage and might, just might, pull it off if we are going towards $70 a barrel. However, these guys really have to be able to generate some serious cash flow at those prices. I do not think oil will go much above $70 for quite a while. They need to show it can work at these prices. I am still wondering whether they could lock a 2nd rig and dedicated frac crew to reduce the operational volatility. With all this debt, they need to get into manufacturing mode. It’s all well and nice to acquire a big acreage position but the markets have gone away from NAV to request actual operating cash flows. They have done well on some dimensions. But they still lack the scale. Very lumpy capex and subsequent cash flow. The good news is the debt restructuring. You complain about the interest but let’s remember the first note was issued in March 2014 when oil was at $100. In effect, they have also pushed back the maturity far out again which gives them breathing room to grow when oil finally recovers. How I see it, this is the bridge they needed to survive. Without it, it would have been game over. I wish they had issued equity instead of the preferred last summer. It converts at $6 but can only be forced into conversion if the common is about $12. In the meantime, Chambers Capital earns 9% interest which will be paid in kind, meaning more dilution for common. I think you are right about the volatility. We are going to see plenty. This is not for the faint hearted. I would like them to strengthen the bench and bring in maybe a senior from EOG that could bring in best practices operationally. Pay that person a million a year, they would be worth every penny for a small shop like LONE...",

Who worked with DARPA back then remains a mystery.Next, the ""new"" research term for a flu vaccine is the ""universal vaccine,"" where one would only get a single vaccine shot that would last for five to as many as ten years.

"I think you are correct in your view that the Phase III Part A preliminary data, which drove the Breakthrough designation, signals positive results and significantly derisks the Phase III Part A trial results. Hard to see any other conclusion than that. And that is huge risk reduction event.Another key factor is the risk of a serious adverse event derailing GBT440 diminishes rapidly as the larger Phase III Part A trial progresses, given the large cohort size. As the pool of patients taking GBT440 grows, there is always the risk that an unknown serious side effect could pop up (classic unknown unknown). So with the progress on Phase III Part A and the results from the other trials to date, that risk has diminished a lot. To me that is also an important risk reduction. What I would really like to see is answers to:1. Will GBT440 replace hydroxyurea? If so, how big is the hydroxyurea market today in terms of volume and what does that tell us about GBT440's potential market size from that source? Surprises me that aspect is never discussed.2. What is the correlation between the Hb increase, sickle cell count, etc outcomes and the PRO scores from the recently reported HOPE-KIDS trial?3. Do the continued appearance of VOCs for the compassionate use patients indicate anything about the efficacy of GBT440? With a 72% reduction in sickle cell counts, it surprises me they were still getting VOCs. But the mechanism that drives a VOC may be driven by factors beyond the concentration of sickled cells (perhaps severe dehydration coupled with high inflammation?). The compassionate use patients were really sick and probably a worse case SCD cohort for a trial. VOCs went down significantly with that group, so I am guessing the VOCs are a non-issue, but would be nice to see some analysis of that.Anyway, your articles have been spot on with GBT. Bravo!!",

The second issue is that the ""great recession"" was such an outlier, that it, as an indicator is massively flawed.  2) The interesting thing is that during economic downturns fast service restaurants tend to actually outperform as their food options are relatively cheap and people trade down market. I have shown a chart of PZZA stock performance during the last ""normal"" recession in 2001, but again, I am conscious of it being a sole data point. 3) When looking at its best comp, Domino's Pizza, the two had previously traded at reasonably similar PE ratios, this materially broke down in 2017.

Gene editing technologies, like the CAR T immuno-oncology products, are the seeds that we are currently studying, planting and irrigating to bring us the fruits that we dream to have. In the case of gene editing, the dreams are enabling the practice of personalized medicine and bringing cures for debilitating and deadly diseases.",
FYI all there are drugs that can be used to knock down the bodies ability to build an immune response to a protein.  Look at all the Rheumatology biologics that use MTX to lower the bodies ability to build an immune response to them.,
"A. May is spot on. I would also add that the media grabbed this headline and the herd drove the price of all three companies down (at one point EDIT was down almost 20%). Monday morning was one of those times to pick up more shares to ""top off"" a core position. Of course, as the hysteria died down and the bargain hunters fed, the price began rising back up finishing the day well off the low, The point being, the market will continue to offer these little gifts as the science matures and the trials report out. With a little patience, there should be plenty of good opportunities to trade around your core. GLTA",
"Yes there are many therapies that exist right now that generate a host antibody response, and many of them can handle that immune response just fine.  So that is good news for CRISPR, but there are still are a few reasons why this discussion is (largely) irrelevant to CRISPR/CAS9 as it is currently being used.1.) Many applications (and those most likely to hit trials first) employ ex vivo editing.  This means the cells are extracted from the patient, edited in a laboratory, and then put back into the patient to do their job (essentially like the hot-topic CAR-T therapies).  This means that the immune system will never be exposed to CRISPR/CAS9 in the first place, so preformed antibodies do not matter.2.) In vivo editing is where the concern for an immune response should be.  However, in vivo applications right now mainly use viral vectors to deliver the CRISPR/CAS9 proteins.  What this means is that there is this chunk of DNA that contains all the info for CRISPR, but that DNA info can't be turned into actual CRISPR proteins until the proper machinery is in place - that machinery is in the nucleus INSIDE of the cells.  In other words, CRISPR/CAS9 will not be injected directly into the body (viral vectors will be), and it won't be made until it is inside of the nucleus which is hidden from immune responses.  This means that CRISPR will be able to do its job unaffected by antibodies whether they exist or not, because they won't be inside the cells that are to be edited. This recent CRISPR article is another example of one that scientists largely shrugged off while the media absolutely ran off with it.  There have been several instances of this lately, creating great entry points for those who have the background to sift through the science.",

GM is a truck company. That is where they make their living and it is a good living. Cars have been loss leaders for them for a long time. They have no shot in the EV marketplace.

"The author is smart, articulate, and polished as usual.I very much like your articles.But..GM. does not have, today, a working prototype or a plan to do ..;1.Cheap Very Highly Efficient VFDs to drive the electric cars of the future.Tsla did 13+ models over 10+ years to get them cheap, reliable, at 400 V / 1700 amps.2.Fast DC charging and long term reliability on battery cells.3.High power electric motors, in small size, of high efficiency and low cost,There are zero producers, in 1/2018, apart from tsla, of 1700 amp/400 V = 680 kW motors, controllers (VFD), cooling, etc4.GM cannot buy, source, or deliver enough batteries to make over 50k BEVS of over 50 kW each, by 2020.The global available free supply is less than that - by 2020.By ye 2023, endless capacity can and will be made available, by many suppliers.But until approx 2021, no real volume capacity globally can exist, above 100 GWh/yr in mobility ex industrial 2017 levels, or so, in the aggregate.Even a mythical 50 GWh global extra capacity means GM/VW/etc could do nothing significant.They need about 1-200 GWh, at the low end, by 2020, to make 2M BEV cars of 50 kWh.Real change needs 1000 Gwh, or 10x more by 2021/2022.Tsla/pana will have the capacity, as will geely/byd.No-one else, +/-...But global auto firms have money.It is likely one or many will buy in and fund expansions in global battery production.Just like tsla did -- more or less proving EM was right.--GM cannot overrun tsla.Global battery production and materials do not allow it, in less than 2-3-5 years at 50x production globally in nickel, cadmium mostly.(Somewhat in lithium. Lithium is easily scaled, by spodumene in australia at 1.5-3x the cost but zero delays, and li only costs == 150-600$ / 60 kW Tsla battery).So tsla can pay 100-500-700$ extra and make 10x the lion batteries they want, per 50k$ car.The fact is that GM + VW + Toyota simply cannot make significant quantities of batteries/cars before about 2022-2023.And they *could*, in fact do so by 2022 and dominate the next biggest industry in the world for decades by resource/skill/process grabs.Just like the chinese did in PV in 2010-2014.I think it is very unlikely the Big Auto executives have the skill and vision to do so.And board backing, financing, etc.I have been involved in 2-3 similar cases, very successfully.",
Still the stock persists.,
"In the future, it might be preferable to pay for an autonomous taxi to take you where you need to go rather than own the car yourself.  The vehicle will often require cleaning, so there will be time for recharging even if it takes a few hours.  Ridesharing is where most of the large automakers are focused.  It might well be simpler to convert auto dealerships into cleaning and maintenance centers for fleets of manufacturer owned taxis.Tesla wanted to do the same I know, but I don't expect that they will survive the next two years to reach this potential nirvana for auto-makers.",
"Tesla is profitable, they just put their money back into the company instead of shareholder pockets, and shareholders are ok with that because they are making great products. The Model 3 is without a doubt the best car on the planet for the money,,, hands down!! Good luck GM and anyone else to come up with a better car for thirty-five grand. If GM thought the Bolt would be a Tesla killer, I can't wait to see what they spit out next. Anyone who thinks the Model 3 is not going to be a massive hit should put aside their biases and go and see one, better yet, drive one and then tell me it's going to fail. When Detroit starts pushing out electric trucks and SUV's I might start to believe they are taking EV's seriously since that's where their profits are made, but building cars off the Bolts platform certainly won't cause Tesla to go bankrupt anytime soon, the Model 3 has raised the bar and everyone but the bears know it.",
"If GM believes in an “all-electric future” then that’s great. Small cars and suvs I understand completely, but their larger fleet (trucks, large vans, commercial vehicles) will still have an ICE for a long time. You just can’t have a fully electric Chevrolet/GMC 3500 pickup pulling a 30,000lb load expecting it to have enough power and range of 400+ miles and charge in 10 minutes or less. Will they come in time? Perhaps, but GM shouldn’t get too ahead of themselves in this electric future they dream about. This is a little off topic I know, but I just wanted to give my 2¢.",

"How many vehicles would TSLA sell annually if they priced the vehicles they sell to make a profit?

What price does TSLA need for those to actually be in the black?How about the new solar roof tiles?  Are those priced to make a profit?  If not, how much higher of a price is needed?  What is the long thesis to profitability for TSLA?",
"I am not an automotive expert, but am an established analyst and consumer of higher than average wealth, and I think that most GM vs. Tesla arguments miss the mark:1.  The customer for a Bolt and a Tesla 3 are different people, just like the person who buys a Buick is different than the person who buys an Audi, even though prices may be comparable.  There are literally millions of people who will never buy a car from GM.  GM just doesn't conjure up images of refined taste, excellence, design, cache, quality, novelty, etc.  Even at the lower end, once one strips out ""made in USA"" leanings, a Malibu doesn't carry same image as an Accord.  Tesla is the iPhone, GM the non-Google Android device.2.  Within GM, Cars are the red-headed step children to trucks and SUVs at GM, and will be for the foreseeable future, due to profit disparities.  The Bolt even more so.  So in any decision on resource priorities, the Bolt loses internally. In contrast, Model 3 is Tesla's future and gets resource priority and attention.3.  When was the last time that GM did anything dominant or innovative in the automotive world? For the last 50 years it has been waging a war to maintain its relevance.  It sells millions of vehicles, but is always struggling to escape mediocracy.  I have respect for CEO Barra, but the only way she destroys Tesla is by buying it.This is not to say Tesla is a good investment.  The stock is based on hype and image, but as far as the competing products go, the Bolt is not real competition for the Tesla 3.  As the the first part of the prior sentence implies - branding matters and GM is at a distinct disadvantage to Tesla.",

"""Tesla is our largest position, long or short. The company cannot survive the next 12 months without access to capital from Wall Street Banks or private investors. We estimate that Tesla will need roughly $8 billion in the next 18 months to fund operating losses, capital expenditures, debts coming due, and working capital needs. However, it appears that due to past SEC investigations and current investigations (which terrifyingly have not been disclosed by the company), it will likely be difficult for Tesla to access public markets. According to a recent analyst report, there have been 85 SEC requests for additional information and disclosures in the last 5 years. This compares to Ford Motor Company's total of zero over the same time frame. This means that Tesla is pushing many, many boundaries. When a company is under formal investigation, it is difficult, if not impossible, to raise capital from public markets as these investigations must be made public, which generally craters the equity and debt values. Therefore, Tesla investors better hope there are a number of Greater Fools in China or elsewhere to keep the company solvent. At some point, the music stops, and there aren't any open chairs. No matter how good a social investment makes you feel as it is going up, extreme anger will result if most or all of your money is permanently lost, especially when it is due to false and misleading statements by senior company officers.

"""Every now and then, someone writes an article that is so full of holes to push a particular viewpoint that it can cause the blood pressures of readers to rise..."" and now you are giving us another one of those...This stuff is super simple, really. GM can make all sorts of models and platforms, and it really makes no difference as long as all of the core electric components including batteries, battery packs, inverters, and control systems come from LG Chem. LG Chem is a good company, but they have nowhere near the ability financially to increase production of batteries as fast as GM and the many other automakers they are contracting with will require. BEVs will be blatantly superior to ICE cars in most major categories very soon, or now in the case of the Model 3, for the same price. Everyone is wondering what the demand will be for BEVs, but this is the wrong question. The question is simply ""what will demand be for clearly superior cars?"" While Tesla only has to grow as fast as possible and make the best cars they can, GM has to replace their huge volumes of car sales with BEV sales. To replace GM's 10 million car annual sales will require 20 first plan Gigafactories worth of battery production, meaning 700 gigawatt-hours of batteries, costing just $100 billion dollars for the factories alone, and then lots of mines will need to be created or expanded too. Again, by 2025 at the very latest it will be blindingly clear how massively superior the BEVs on offer are to the ICE cars available, so really no one will want to buy the ICE cars. But there is also a zero percent chance that anyone will have built the $100 billion worth of battery factories that GM needs. GM is as sure to go to zero as a rock is sure to sink in water.

The first existential argument was that Tesla was so much smarter than everybody else, they discovered a way to make a car that would be 10 times more reliable and cost a fraction to build versus ICEs and of course, none of the competitors would discover this until Tesla had build an impenetrable moat.Obviously that didn't work, so they abandoned the first mover argument and progressed to the overwhelming cost advantage argument.  The first iteration of this was the Gigafactory, which was to be the dominant battery production facility, beating competitors by 30% through economy of scale.That didn't work for a variety of reasons, but the main reason is that they placed all their bets on the ridiculously inefficient roll-up cells that nobody else will be using.  And they took years longer than planned to get it running (it is still not really running in any reliable way).  At the same time, BYD, LG and others have built larger gigafactoried producing better battery systems.When the gigafactory strategy failed to deliver any advantage, Musk moved on to the ""Alien Dreadnaught"" argument that talked about dramatically lowering the cost of manufacturing, in part by using all the 3D space within the plant.Well, guess what?  While Tesla is fumbling around trying to get a line to produce more than a few cars per hour, life moves on in the rest of the auto industry.  GM and everybody else is already well on the way to their own ""alien dreadnaughts"", except they simply call it ""continuous improvement in manufacturing processes.""Time is an important element.  When Tesla blows their schedules by years, it is not just the cash flow and market share they lose.  They also lose ground on continuous improvement.  Tesla compares very well to the auto industry of 2002.  Unfortunately they are going against the auto industry of 2018.It is exactly the same story with FSD technology.  At one point with MobilEye, Tesla was actually a player of sorts.  But when MobilEye had to sever relations, this cost Tesla 3 years evidently, and that is crucial.  Time is the most important factor in this competition.Tesla has nothing left.  Nothing.  This game is coming to a close.",
Great article.  Jim Chanos agrees with you.,
"Tesla will soon be pronounced.  Autopsy will determine that death occurred from the allure of easy money from Wall Street, which once cut off, caused rapid and fatal withdrawal of Tesla employees and fanboy deposits.  The company owes so much money that if Wall Street wants to keep this vegetable on life support, they can demand usurious rates to do so - think huge dilution with a stock sale below 150.  I doubt any sane Investment bank - not even a Morgan Stanley - would do another junk bond capital raise.  Well, maybe they would, at a 20% interest rate.",
"Let’s just leave the poor Tesla people alone.  They’re happy where they are, and their denial is going to be hard to overcome in the course of an article.  The GM story is fascinating.  Very impressive – if they execute, and based on some fairly firm statements, it sounds like they’re confident they can execute.Increased battery efficiency, multiple models, a huge potential market in China and the Chinese very much want EV’s for better air and reduced oil imports.  Transportation as a service (ride sharing).  Take Uber valuations, increase the scale, reduce the cost, and you have a model that has huge potential.  I think through how that model will operate and it’s amazing.  Automated maintenance of vehicles; predictive, data-based modeling of ridership needs and subsequent resource allocation; automated payments; minimal labor, maximum efficiency.  I don’t care how many Bolts GM sells, I don’t care if Tesla sells one car or 100,000 – if GM gets the ride share model up and running with anywhere near the margins I think they’ll be getting, then GM is gold.  And in 2020 they proliferate the model beyond the limited 2019 deployment to center-cities.  GM will expand/grow beyond city centers to larger areas, then to mid-sized cities, and also internationally – what major city doesn’t want that GM model in their city?  London, Paris, Beijing, Tokyo (ok, the Japanese won’t allow it) – every large city, globally.And that’s all separate from GM’s progress in autonomous driving.  AV doesn’t have to be limited to EVs.  What Los Angeles commuter stuck bumper to bumper on a 5 lane highway at rush hour wouldn’t pay a lot for level 4 autonomy?  Or Chicago commuter or NYC or Boston or wherever?  Every commuter wants a more relaxing commute, and GM is very close to offering it.  You can buy it now on select Cadillac models.  It’s coming.  Why there’s so little discussion about GM’s level 4 AV puzzles me.  Maybe I don't follow the right web-sites/publications.I really don’t care about Tesla.  Leave them alone – they’re happy.   Very easy to leave them be.  GM has me very interested.",
"GM already overrun themselves by killing its own EV1, long time ago !!!",
"Amazon thought the same thing about Google. The model 3 is a much more enjoyable and sensible car than the bolt. GM does not believe in quality of life improvements to the degree that Tesla does and that doesn't bode well for the product in an EV era. GM has not committed any resources to mass manufacturing their own batteries or providing building a super charger network. Slow selling Chevy Bolt inventory is building up and making GM even weaker at the knees. Your predictions are actually just long-GM, biased, wishful thinking.",

"On other thing I would like to mention, i would be not surprised if sales of model S and X will stagnate, because this market is extremely tiny. My guess is that most owners use it as a second car and still drive for long distances and commuting their benz, or BMW. I myself drive a beautiful MB GLC, it has as all MBs also rain sensors :),",
"I am pretty sure if model 3 production increases, it will be #1 in terms of sales in 2018 , and GM’s Volt. But this is not an important point for the stock tesla. What is important is, that Tesla cannot produce and sell profitably. So the more they sell the higher their losses will be. So I wish Tesla would ramp up more quickly but they are to inexperienced in mass production. The next capital raise will come and as long as the capital markets are open for tesla they will not go bankrupt but sooner or later it will happen, my guess is in 2020. Before we will see the stock going down slowly in 2018 and then rapidly in 2019",
"I am not so sure about GM's success, even it looks like Tesla's finances are troublesome, to say the least. On the other hand, Tesla S is a car people want to own, Chevy is something they settle for if they cannot afford Tesla. Is new car market divided to those who want a good working car like Accord, Camry, Outback, etc. for a price. And those who regardless of price go after the car they really want and end up with Mercedes GT, Tesla S, Nissan GTR, etc. Are there enough people to buy GM electric car, which is neither luxury status car nor practical down to earth cost-effective choice? Sor same reason I am unsure of Tesla model 3's success. It is too cheap and small, yet too expensive to run head to head with Accord.",
"GM is on top of my radar list, after Buffett increased his stake.",
"I don't read GMs moves to include EVs as a commitment to an all electric future. Indeed, no one who understands anything at all about the technologies associated with motor vehicles believes this. The fundamental physics and chemistry of batteries limits their utility; alternative engine types are in development and will undoubtedly take market share in the coming decades, and most importantly, it is a myth that internal combustion engines don't also undergo improvements through R&D and will continue to do so.  30 years hence the market will still be significant, if not dominant, in gasoline fueled vehicles. Perhaps most importantly, GM, like any consumer products company that wishes to not only survive but thrive, aims to deliver that which customers demand.  Some demand EVs; others have no use for them. GM, like all the other automakers run by experienced adult business people, produces a wide range of vehicle types to meet the wide range of customer needs and demands.Only one automaker, run by a narcissistic, arrogant, and clueless CEO chooses to focus on the one segment of the market that cannot yet command sufficient demand, and which is too expensive to serve under current technology.",
"After 30 years of investing, I am long GM for the first time. I like the story line on EV.",
"Really don't understand the constant drumbeat of GM vs Tesla; a 14 year old non profit organization, burning cash by the billions, which has staked it's survival on producing thousands of the Model 3: A small sedan that will cost $50,000 in a market where consumers are abandoning sedans in a tsunami of crossovers. And trucks. And SUVs. Like the ones GM builds profitably by the millions. And GM is coming out with a full line of EVs in all shapes and sizes within the next 2 years. And GM is leading in autonomous vehicles. And GM pays a fat dividend, easily covered by it's billions in earnings. That's the E that comes after the P when evaluating a stock. Because GM's P/E is half that of the S&P 500, making it a screaming deal. And it's about time for Tesla to raise cash again, diluting shareholder, again. It does it every 6 months or so, new stock or a big sale of high interest bonds, increasing the debt. It's the bitcoin of car companies.",

"Its a good perspective, but I fear its a very US centric view. Tesla has carved out a niche globally. GM doesn't exist any longer in Europe, so it's really just a regional player, albeit North America is quite a big region. China will control which EVs are sold there, which might give GM some breathing space, but will always favour the local JV partner. More of a concern for Tesla is the availability of materials like cobalt for the Li-ion batteries.",
"Donn, not exactly a fair fight. You begin to dignify what most thinking people, including thinking bulls, choose to ignore.On the larger point, GM faces the same problem Tesla does: battery storage is simply not yet economical, or close to it. The development and production of EVs is driven by mandates and subsidies, period.Someday, that will be different, but not with existing battery technology or improvements at the margin.Of course, that is a much bigger problem for Tesla than GM. By building EVs, GM saves money on ZEV mandates, and can actually sell some (and reduce the price Tesla can fetch). Thus, it minimizes the hit that its hugely profitable truck and SUV lines generate.For Tesla, there is the EV, and only the EV. What might have been (sensible hybrids, per Martin Eberhard) was killed by the Visionary One.",
"Tesla actually has proactively created a scale for customers of the EV market. The technology changes and engineering accomplishments are tremendous -as is their sharing and expanding the learning quote along with global brands. GM - with Mrs. Barra at the helm, envisioned the necessary forward guidance, leadership, and investment to move and redesign the future as Tesla’s  vision took hold. Both companies have done an incredible job. GM - a much larger ship to manage- is showing how  large companies can still lead into the future.",

Rayonmanl don’t  take me wrong. I'm   here just because I found a pretty interesting stuff  about Pluristem. I do not know who wins the competition PSTI or CBLI.

"http://bit.ly/2FDPV65Mar 16, 2016) - Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (NASDAQ: CBLI) today announced an update on the regulatory review of its pre-Emergency Use Authorization (pre-EUA) submission for entolimod as a radiation countermeasure following the receipt of minutes from a recent meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).As part of the company's response to pre-EUA review comments received from the FDA, a meeting was held with the Agency to discuss various aspects of entolimod manufacturing. At this meeting, and subsequently confirmed by the FDA's official minutes of the meeting, it was determined that an in vivo study will be necessary to establish bio-comparability between the entolimod drug formulation proposed for use under the pre-EUA and the drug formulation used in previously conducted preclinical and clinical studies. The FDA indicated that further review of the pre-EUA dossier would not proceed until these bio-comparability data have been evaluated by the Agency. The design of the bio-comparability study is currently in development and will need to be agreed upon with the FDA before the study is executed.Yakov Kogan, PhD, MBA, Chief Executive Officer of Cleveland BioLabs, commented, ""While this FDA request has temporarily slowed our progress, we remain fully committed to the pursuit of pre-EUA status and commercialization for entolimod. We will provide further updates regarding the estimated timing for performance and reporting of the study once the design is finalized. Our goals are to satisfy the FDA's request and facilitate continued regulatory review of the pre-EUA dossier for entolimod as soon as possible.""Apr 17, 2017) -  Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (NASDAQ: CBLI) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has completed its review of a side-by-side analytical comparison of two formulations of entolimod. The FDA agreed with CBLI that these data indicate the in vitro analytical comparability of the formulations. Based on the outcome of its review, the FDA has provided CBLI with its consent for initiation of an in vivo biocomparability study of these formulations in non-human primates (NHP).The objective of the in vivo biocomparability study is to compare the historical drug formulation used in prior nonclinical and clinical studies versus the to-be-marketed drug formulation of entolimod submitted for approval under CBLI's application for pre-Emergency Use Authorization (pre-EUA). Entolimod is a novel, broad-spectrum investigational drug being developed to mitigate the life-threatening consequences of a radiological or nuclear attack.""We are excited to have received agreement from the FDA to commence the in vivo biocomparability study,"" continued Yakov Kogan, PhD, MBA, Chief Executive Officer. ""Following completion of the in vivo study and discussion of the submitted study results with the FDA, we expect the agency to resume the review of our pre-EUA dossier.""The planned biocomparability study is funded in part by the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program (JWMRP) contract award number W81XWH-15-C-0101 to CBLI. The DoD JWMRP contract is valued at up to $9.2 million and supports further development of entolimod as a medical radiation countermeasure.Aug 14, 2017 Yakov Kogan, Ph.D., MBA, Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""The pursuit of approval by the EMA and FDA and commercialization for entolimod as a medical radiation countermeasure remains our top priority."" Nov 14, 2017  ""The pursuit of approval by the FDA and EMA and commercialization for entolimod as a medical radiation countermeasure (MRC) are continuing to be the company's most important priorities and goals. During this past quarter, we collated and submitted manufacturing information (Module 3) to the FDA. We also initiated the in vivo biocomparability study in non-human primates that had been previously requested by the Agency as part of their review of our pre-EUA application; this study is ongoing. Following completion of this study and discussion of the study results with the FDA, we expect the agency to resume review of our pre-EUA dossier.""

"Dear All, I am surprised to see that the article by PSTI lobbyist triggered such an engaged response on SA. The guy calls himself a ""Scientist of Fortune"", but this is just cheap talk. The companies covered by the author conducted experiments following the rules of toxicology and were apparently using doses consistent with 50% mortality (LD50) at a level above 7 Gy. Even though CBLI and PSTI drugs showed approximately equal survival rates under these experimental conditions, it is naive to think that the FDA will grant its approval on the basis of these results alone. Chronic experiments will be necessary to study the long-term effects of these drugs. This would involve examining mutagenesis and oncological consequences for animals subjected to acute radiation and treated with the drugs in question. The experience of radiology shows that strong radiation causes multiple mutations in animal and human cells and, in turn, frequently leads to fatal oncological consequences. God forbid to use stem cell under such conditions. This would most likely require the use of monoclonal antibodies against own stem cells – a practice already employed in a number of cancer treatments, such as PROVENGE. Moreover, drugs that involve stem cells have a poor history when it comes to the FDA approval.The only sensible way to protect against radiation damage is to use a drug that combines immunostimulating and anti-cancer properties (entolimode, for example, ticks the boxes on both of these criteria)",
Thanks for the answer Scientist I'll wait for your new article.,
"Thank you Scientist for your informative article. I'm long on PSTI and hope you are going to write an article completely dedicated to Pluristem.  Like any other company  Pluristem has positive and negative sides. One of the negatives is a  lack of a serious partnership. It's impossible IMO for such a small company  to be engaged in research, clinical studies etc for so many indications. Does it not seem to you that writing  ""higher effectiveness of entolimod"" is somewhat premature? I mean that the information on PLX-R18 we have today is the results of a pilot study which, according to the company's statement  ""was not powered to demonstrate statistical significance"" and we will get the full picture only after  pivotal trial and  DOD studies.I'm surprised that a company like CBLI that has a strong connection with Russia is involved in developing of countermeasure for ARS.I don't  want to say anything bad about these people but I am absolutely sure that in Russia there is complete information about this work.Russia is a country whose state television has threatened the US with a nuclear attack.

"Tetragrammation, Good comment, Is there a possibility that at some point it might be beneficial to administer both CBLI and PSTI?  I realize that more clinical studies would need to be done, but there may be significant life saving/restoring benefits in properly administrating both.",
"It should perhaps have been explained that entolimod works by reactivating the human gut's ability to process food to sustain life, after having been zapped.  Victims of radiation over-exposure die in a few days, typically, as a result of the bloodstream being denied sustenance, and effectively they are dying of starvation.  Obviously it is very difficult to arrange a large-scale clinical trial with human subjects, and this has been the stumbling-block to CBLI's financial viability.Even in the (hopeful) absence of a hostile event requiring immediate wide availability of entolimod, I think there is a chance of CBLI getting meaningful stockpile contracts without full availability of results for the bioavailability study.  Professor Gudkov is not only brilliant; he is also quite persuasive.  The caution of the FDA may be over-ridden by suitable contacts higher up in the current administration -- maybe at the top.  (I would consider the Professor to be Trump's kind of scientist guru).

"Excellent/Informative article, I was not completely aware of all of the advantages that PTSI may have in relation to ARS.  Also, even though it might lose out to CBLI in the US (if that occurs) it appears as if PTSI may have the advantage in Europe for similar purposes since PTSI seems to be better known there, has received large EURO funding for other indications and that PTSI seems to do all mfg in house and seems approved in Europe for quality mfg purposes and appears to have qualified under Good Mfg Practices in the US: (GMP).The fact that PTSI seems to have little or no known side effects, has other beneficial purposes for other medical indications and appears to have increased time limits for administration, as you indicated SOF, may also help tip odds in PTSI's favor? Note: However, I could see how CBLI with perhaps more political lobbying power and being a US company may have the US gov't advantage? Hope it plays out in the best interest of civilians if unfortunately it is ever needed for ARS use.Question: Who does the manufacturing for CBLI? Thanks",

"I agree with the author that we are carriers of subjective truth, if he agrees that he is also subjective. I'm not going to compare different drugs against radiation damage, but I express a strong doubt that they can compare with the entolimod. Why? The simple-entolimode activates the TLR response. This is an increase in natural immunity and this drug can have a great future not only in the field of radiation damage.",

"Thanks for the article.  I'll take the other side of the bet and see it remain cost prohibitive to drill off shore due to competition form increased land drilling, increased heavy weather due to global warming, rising aversion to off shore environmental and other risks and an increased application of alternative energy.

"Thanks for the good, informative article.  It's good to hear my own opinion of the market reinforced, I admit, but I am not wishful thinking, in my investments.  The Market does insane things more often than it behaves rationally, and critics like Henrick, who I respect, seem to become overly critical near bottoms than tops.  How many of the highest flyers in other industries can justify their stratospheric multiples?  I've seen that irrationality before, and with few offering caution advice. That's human nature and not shocking.Looking at the Market (charts), I see signs that it's time to buy.  Most analysts have downgraded, recently, which is my key indicator.  You can, IMO, safely do the opposite when they ""notice"" these stocks near highs and lows.  Confirmation for me will be one more big anal-yst going from Hold to any Sell recommendation.  They have to recommend Sell so that they can later change to Buy, when they're ready to unload.  Then, the charts have shown relatively steady sideways motion after leveling-off, with no small or large spikes and a big rise, on low volume.  In the past month, two of the OSD's I follow have doubled, again on low volume, which is how the big Banks and Institutions like to accumulate.  At these levels, any small, serious buying can cause a double, and then easily double again.I am not saying this is the bottom and we won't see another sell-off, just that the odds are against it, in my experience, and the supply/demand factor suggests growing demand, as the World economy follows a solid boom in the U.S.",

You all do realize I hope that these boards have been full of 'shorts' for years and they are very good but I sure hope you never let them in your head as you would have missed out on the greatest dollar war in history that by way of derivative effect sent these driller names down 90% and created a once in a life time opportunity for long term investors.

Long ESV thru options.. better company than NE that’s for sure,
Many thanks to the author for a great article on drilling companies.  I have already begun byinvesting in Enbridge. I will pick up a driller too. Keep them coming.,
Is there an OSD ETF?,
I have a son who owned a company that moved pumping equipment for Chevron to new well sites. He remarked when oil was cheap that it was funny that there was so much excess excess drilling and exploration equipment and men idle and no one was drilling while drilling was cheap. It has always been as far as I can tell a curiosity that expensive oil stretches drilling capacity and raises prices for exploration while it seems that the exact opposite approach for big oil would be the most logical   - drill when you can squeeze the drillers. Funny how the rise in oil prices always puts the drillers back to work when the exact opposite approach is the. OST logical for big oil. Long RIG. Hedged some and took some money off again. It’s been a profitable quarter.,
"The idea that offshore has never been in such a funk before is inaccurate. 1980-1985 was as bad. The author gives no reason for his repeated assertion that offshore oil and gas will voluntarily go out of business by never again ordering any new drilling ships, etc. when the current fleet ages out. As an assertion with no reasons to back it up, this sounds like more bear market fear than anything else. This cyclical industry will overshoot again on the upside in a few years by over-ordering new drilling equipment. It always has. As long as there is oil and gas to be found offshore, the offshore oil and gas industry will keep looking for it. The last bull market in offshore activity (2003-2008) lasted for five years. So far, this one has been developing for about five months. I believe the author is correct in suggesting that we are only at the beginning of a multi-year bull market in offshore. At the moment, buying any of the survivors who are not facing bankruptcy will probably work out extremely well.",
"The offshore drillers all have older assets on their books ( except fir Seadrill, and Vantage). These older assets will eee to b recycled/ scrapped at some future point. that will impact the value of the drillers as they write off these assets.  Not ready to accept that things will be rosy going forward. Although there are some contact signings, the day rates are at break even or close to break even. Too much enthusiasm because oil prices are going up a bit. Long RIg",
"Excellent article, and I am typically somewhat sparing in praise.  It demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of stock investing.  People who say things like it will be another 6-12 months before the stocks can be ""safely accumulated"" simply do not understand market dynamics.  The best time to buy stocks are at a point of maximum pessimism.  That point was August.  Had you bought then, you would have doubled your money by now.  The notion of safety as espoused by one commentator here is an amateurish assessment of safety.  Safety is not found when prices are high and there is a cheery consensus as to how good things are.  True safety is found when prices are low and everyone is throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  IMO, the issue to focus on is the Rystad chart on crude discoveries.  That is what made me buy a very large position in ESV.  Offshore is a long cycle business.  Shale is wonderful but it won't come anywhere close to offsetting even the annual decline in offshore.  (That said, buy shale completions companies with both fists--a much better investment for now than the offshore drillers.  I like TUSK and WTTR in particular, but also CJ.)",
"Some remarks:Putting the weakest (NE) of the Top 5 drillers on a level with the strongest (DO) looks odd here. Calling Noble a ""high quality company"" looks even more odd to me. The company still needs to refinance hundreds of millions of bond debt going forward.Being free cash flow positive on an operating is simply a function of legacy contracts still contributing high-margin dayrates but as these old contracts run off, the cash flow picture will deteriorate for all drillers. Moreover, Noble has meaningful near-term debt maturities which (without refinancing) will cause overall cash flows to be materially negative.Calling offshore drillers ""cheap"" just because they are still down meaningfully from their all-time highs seems equally odd. In fact, the gap between industry financials and valuations has extended to record levels now as investors hope for new contract awards and dayrate improvements in the not too distant future.Moreover, neither Noble nor Transocean have produced any free cash flow in 2017 - yes, they still generated cash from operations but debt service / management caused overall cash flows to be negative for both companies. Furthermore, cash flows from operations will deteriorate heavily going forward as more and more legacy contracts run off.Transocean is currently expected to use the majority of its cash until the end of the decade and has a large and expensive debt load.Next issue is the author's expectation "" that the assets these companies own today will remain in use for decades"" which, clearly, won't be the case as evidenced by the ongoing scrapping of rigs that are just past half of their expected useful life.Diamond Offshore has actually stated that the industry needs to develop better equipment for its customers and might soon announce a new drillship design.Lastly, the author doesn't even discuss Rowan and Ensco, two drillers that look far superior to particularly NE.",
but wait.... all the reports are that solar and wind are the future.... are you telling us that there is still a place for oil?  :-),
"Healthy Wealth Coach I enjoyed your article. Lets say for a moment everything you say is true then still as of today why no meaningful contracts? Sure we have seen some jobs here and there but nothing special.  Can it be because the same oil super majors have in recent years poured billions into shale projects?  Many on the OSD boards post often that no E&P has taken place but a look at the super majors earnings reports show they have spent heavily, just not on offshore. The OSD  have had an amazing run in the last few weeks and I am happy to say I have benefited from that but its really the cart before the horse here.  The contracts and earnings reports just dont support.  Now personally I am happy to ride the ship higher with oil and hope those contracts come but I have no illusions if they do not they will sink just as swiftly.",
Still too early....ANother 6-12 months before you can safely start accumulating..,
"I guess it would be wise to wait for a correction in drillers before going long, as RSI is at +70 at the moment and stocks will likely go down a bit IMO.Kind regards,Mchic",
its a good article but a year too early im thinking..we still havn't unleashed opec yet...lets see how much they and others can ramp up...the oil and gas is flowing right now..tuck your money in US onshore energy..get paid while you wait with Midstreams..then pounce...,

"I have been taking Mannatech products for over 25 years and they have definitely helped my memory. I bought the MTEX stock because I know the products work. The stock gets hammered  by folks like Kelly, and sets up a good buying opportunity. The products keep working and folks keep using the products and the company does well. The MLM part seems to make the stock price very volatile. Stay healthy my friends.",
"wait, was this article actually published as a Pro article? haha....",
"Interesting article, but too small of a company for me to follow. Keep digging Kelly, thanks!",
"I guess my second question, not to 2whls or Kelly ""Contrarian"" Stewart, but to the Seeking Alpha editors is - why would you allow a first-time poster (like Kelly) to publish an article asserting: (1) that a profitable, FCF positive company with $0, to slightly negative enterprise value is trading with ""rich valuation"", and (2) possible financial manipulation with absolutely zero supporting evidence?The former suggests a complete lack of credibility, and zero understanding of how companies/stocks are valued. Also given the fact this is the ""author's"" first article, Seeking Alpha should view it with more scrutiny than usual. The need for thorough review of this article (before publishing it) should have been very clear to the editors- is anyone with a high school degree taking this article seriously? Is this the type of rigorous, high-quality investment analysis we want published on Seeking Alpha?The latter is an extremely serious allegation with extremely serious implications for peoples' lives and financial well-being. If Seeking Alpha is to allow an author to allege that a company is engaging in financial manipulation, it should mandate the author include at least a single shred of supporting evidence that is packaged in a logical, coherent write-up. NOT just referring to the ""fascinating research"" Is anyone surprised by the absence of a response from the author to any of the thoughtful comments posted here? Haha...Kelly- you also wrote: ""There's litigation risk here given the lawsuit brought by the Texas Attorney General.""Which lawsuit specifically are you referring to? Are you making one up? Pls be specific. Editors- are we going to let Kelly make up imaginary lawsuits, and use them as an attempt to discredit the company?",
"Hi Peggy from Porcupine! Please let us know your experience with the products and the company. Let me remind everyone else that a lot of us (I don't know the number) have been taking Mannatech products for many years. (I and some friends have been taking them for over 25 years.) We have seen many companies come and go in that time, that have had inferior products. We know the Mannatech products have a positive effect on our lives and we will be taking them for as long as we breath. The only reason I have bought MTEX shares is because I have experienced beneficial results from the products and have faith in the leadership of the company. These products from time to time seemed to have performed miracles in peoples lives. This has made some of the associates over enthusiastic about the products. I know these products improve my cognitive abilities.This is the main reason I take these products. If you have not tried them, you could be missing out on positive life changing effects. Effects that many of us continue to experience. A person has six months to give these products a good test in their life. If they don't work for you, you can exercise the six month money back guarantee.",
"My question is this:  If this company is as unethical as you hint at (""Possible Manipulator"") why have not just vented here?  Why have you not taken your research to the proper authorities so this type of 'fraud' can be dealt with.  Anyone can vent.  Put your money where your mouth (pen) is.",
"The cash balance may seem high, but look at the A/P numbers - especially the Commissions Payable to the Associates, which are paid every 2 weeks.  With that, the cash is not as rosy as you may think.

Who's buying & selling? There is no I/R activity, and why are dividends now being paid against losses?",
"I'm glad others have already picked up on how incredibly superficial this analysis is. Kelly- FYI, that 50x P/E you mentioned is completely meaningless in the context of a net cash balance that exceeds market cap, not to mention $0.80/sh of adjusted EPS in the past two quarters alone. I will do the math for you... MTEX's peer group trades at an average 18x P/E, which implies MTEX is a $30 stock at peer avg multiples and perhaps upwards of $50 if you layer in the $15 net cash/sh currently on the balance sheet.My response here is only scratching the surface of the numerous fallacies/inaccuracies in your article, and I'm absolutely baffled that Seeking Alpha would even agree to publish it.",

If you are not taking Mannatech products, there is an excellent chance you are not living up to your full potential. You can take these products risk free for 6 months. Not everybody seems to be helped. But if you haven't given them a chance, you will never know. That old lawsuit has caused a lot of folks to miss out on great products.",
My big source of confusion with this company is why are they holding onto so much cash?,
"With all due respect, this article misses the mark on MTEX.Yes, the company has hair on it, and MLM companies are among those people love to hate.  Nevertheless, that doesn't make it a bad investment.  Just ask Bill Ackman how his short against Herbalife went.Worse still, the ""analysis"" that was done here is inch-deep and basically consists of a) reading a news article about the Texas AG looking into MTEX, b) a quick trip to the Mannatech website, and c) pulling a bunch of stats off Gurufocus.  Huh?  What about looking at the actual financial statements?  A cursory look at the latest 10-Q would show you that MTEX has a book value of $41mm.  MTEX has a market cap of $40mm; 1:1 Price-to-book - so far so good.  But the company has $35mm OF CASH ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND NO DEBT.  Suppose you figure that some of the cash has to stay on the balance sheet and therefore can't be subtracted against the market value.  Fine.  Let's use current assets less current liabilities then.  This figure is roughly $22mm, which means that for $40-22mm = $18mm, you're getting a business which in the first 9 months of 2017 generated $4mm of Net Income + D&A with very minimal capex.  Annualized, we're talking about a 4x P/FCF-type company.  Forget overvalued - MTEX might be one of the most UNDERVALUED companies out there.Finally, what action are you recommending here for would-be investors?  Sell the stock?  Short it?  A glance at the average daily volume on MTEX and the float would show you that the stock is very thinly traded, making it more difficult than your average stock to buy/sell without dealing with large bid/asks.  I am not going to tout the merits of the company - no one knows the future, and each person is entitled to an opinion.

Hopefully not an expensive learning curve.In most regard I agree with your wait and see approach.

"Najak, i highly suggest that you go back and re-read your prior post it will make you a better investor. Since we all can have revisionist history of reality especially after we've been consistently wrong so many times. Then eventually squeaked out a profit that was contrary to all our prior thinking (""better to be lucky than good""). Remember we both were long TEVA but for different thesis. I anticipated that my investment would take a 2 to 5-years to play out but it has recovered sooner. So it would be normal and healthy to have a 5 to 10% pull back short term. The calls was what I usually will sell if it runs up as it eventually did to help reduce my stock cost basis, Therefore, I know the odds are against me since I nor other investors can't trade the short term ups and downs of any stock consistently. Therefore, I will hold until it reaches my fair market value then I sell. All the best, SI1956",

"@jpluto - I realize that the Moody's downgrade isn't a huge deal, but it is material news -- it *actually* happened, where as before it was only believed to be likely.   So that makes it news.@BaldElon - I realize that 4% isn't a ""plummet"" in most people's books, but for traders, this makes a difference.  Remember that just gaining 3% monthly, compounds up to 42% annually, which more than doubles your money every 2 years.   4% change is more than an entire month's worth of budget on gains, for  a trading strategy like mine.Even on a stock like TEVA, where I'm bullish, I intend to trade in/out of it at the peaks and troughs.The Moody's Downgrade *combined* with the fact that TEVA just rose 18% this week without much new news, spell *this* to me -- ""the tide is about to shift back"".   I believe we're more likely to see TEVA hit $19 next week than for it to hit $25.  I could be wrong, but I think the odds are that I'm right, which is why I sold out.   I don't do many things halfway.... when I'm convinced that the stock is headed in a certain direction, I commit to my convictions and either buy a lot or sell a lot.   I don't see a good reason to ride the back trace down, when I can just hold cash, and add this to my virtual profits on TEVA.  I've done this a few times already with TEVA since August, and decreased my avg price from $18.85 down to $17.20 in doing so.And so I'll continue to do this; I play the odds.",
ALERT: For those who haven't seen it yet.  It was just announced publicly at 3:07pm that Moody's downgrade TEVA 2-notches to junk status for credit rating.    This is what caused the sharp plummet from $22.60 down to $21.82 in just 10 minutes.I forecast that more downside (short-term) is ahead due to this downgrade.  It's going to be a bumpy ride ahead.  (I'm counting on it.),
It seems odd that no one comments on the massive increase in interest expense that is coming.  TEVA's debt is so far below market that when it needs to be refinanced (They can't repay it) interest expense will soar thus reducing cash flow and earnings.,
"Wow... last I read you were pumping SP would run up due to the sand bagged CC, what happen?",
"FYI, for those following my profile -- today I sold COMPLETELY OUT of TEVA.   My portfolio is now all cash.   My concentrated strategy has gained for me 65% since March 2017 (9.5 months).   So far so good.   Although I wouldn't recommend most others taking the same levels of risk as I.I'm now waiting for a TEVA pullback, which I think might be fairly significant.  I'm still bullish on TEVA, but I'm a wave trader, not a long-term holder-only.  I think TEVA is likely to pull back to near $19 before it continues upwards, and so I await re-entry from the sidelines.  If I don't get the chance to re-enter, that's fine too, as I've made almost 25% gain on TEVA in 5 months, which exceeds my goal of 3%/month gains average.  So far, TEVA was a win for me, and if I don't re-enter, it's still a win, per my strategy.    I'm now 3 for 3 -- FSLR at $29.50, then GILD at $67, and now TEVA at $17.20 avg.",

"Michael, I am glad to see that you held on to your shares and came around to a very rational thesis on the future of TEVA, as laid out in your above article.  Well done.   And while the share price has changed since your last article, most of what you write was knowable or at least probable prior to the crash.  I think you make a very valid point about the Actavis acquisition, it was necessary but very rich.  What many bears failed to understand about their thesis is this:  The market discounted events that were not going to happen.  A mere ratings downgrade or a quarterly miss doesn't result in a 60% drop.  The market was discounting massive losses from the generic division (including further impairments of the Actavis goodwill), a complete eradication of copaxone and a highly dilutive equity raise.  These are no longer valid bear arguments and have therefore been taken out of the equation.  As a contrarian you have to be familiar with what the bear thesis is, and you have to act independently of sentiment.  The sentiment was so rotten at the bottom that valuation meant very little, and the bear case looked like a solid bet.  Now the stock is technically overbought so don't be surprised if we give back some of these gains, but make no mistake, TEVA and Kare should create value for shareholders over time.",

Everyone was flabbergasted by TEVA's ""inability to forecast"", yet, it's vital to realize that at the time, it was in TEVA's best interest to tank things, take out the trash, and set the bar super low for Kare.Mission accomplished.  They tanked it from $32 to $11 in just a few months, fueled mostly by surprisingly bad outlooks.   Were you not suspicious of this when TEVA announced immediately that they expected to lose ~40% of their Copaxone to MYL in the first quarter MYL released this generic?  Huh?!   As it turns out, MYL only captured about 5% of the market with the 40 mg treatment (note that they already had market share with their 20 mg treatment).It appears that very few people admit the ""real story"" of what happened in 2017, which is that TEVA's ulterior motives were two-fold:(a) set the bar low for Kare (probably meeting his own preconditions), and (b) set the stage to support drastic cuts (hard to do this if the perception isn't that ""the sky is falling"".Mission accomplished.  Too many investors take what companies say at ""face value"" instead of reading-between-the-lines and assessing their ulterior motives.  Even in the aftermath, the focus is not upon ""what really happened here""; instead it we talk as though all of this narrative that just played out was not in large part facilitated, as it works out to the best interest of TEVA stakeholders for the long haul.",
GE is in the same boat. Short term pain for long term gain,
"This stock is up around 100% since its low almost 2 months ago. That is pretty remarkable considering no turnaround has been proven, only talk. Obviously sentiment has definitely changed for this stock, hopefully the fundamentals will align with sentiment soon. I'll admit I was long the stock at $11, but did get out around $18 in fear of massive volatility like Valeant. Wall Street really made Valeant suffer but it appears Teva might get a pass. No question I think this will be a great long term play (years), however I still fear there might be a chance for massive volatility. Good luck longs!",
What happened to all those analysts and target prices at 7? And all shorts shorting at 11?,
I feel lucky to have started my position at 15 and add more at 14. If it dips back down below those levels again I will buy more.,
Selling 17 1/2 puts,
Long TEVA!,
"45-50  maybe IMO   in 2-3 years.. ill take it,..nice gain.. hopefully.. :)",
Teva was too great to miss at $11,
Your a little late to the party but welcome on board.  I think you may be able to squeeze out some gains as the easy money has been made.   Good luck and we welcome all teva newbies.,
What a crazy few months has this stock endured..,
Great article with a great title. No doubt. TEVA is the biggest generic drug company in the world and posed for big turn around and gains this year. Long loyal shareholder.,Teva: This Is Simply Too Great To Miss
Thoughts on the results?,
Are you still long into earnings tomorrow? Any expectations?,

"David,You won't regret it - we've been in since 1972...",
"Equitywonk,Thanks for the heads up that this cable/internet thing will be dead by 2019. And I’m glad you included a Forbes article backs your thesis up. Certainly you’ve even alerted us that valuations are not compelling.  Meanwhile CMCSA hits it’s all-time high (sarcasm mode now turned off)...",
"I fundamentally believe that cable companies will be at structural disadvantage to cellular operators, once 5g is in place (2019) no one will need nor want to pay for cable tv, you will be able to get everything you want via cellular/mobile. Q3 '17 saw a material deceleration in YoY HSI customer additions, the rate fell by some 36% from 288k (Q3'16 additions) to 182k, while voice customers actually fell by 94k customers and cable video saw a decline of 134k vs growth of 19k in Q3 '16. But even if I'm wrong, and I'm not foolish enough to assume that cant happen, the valuations are not, in my view, compelling. As to the issue of forward estimates, fair enough, but one must look forward to know if the rear view is of any relevance.ThxDecent article to read:http://bit.ly/2qW6gzv",
"Thank you for your note. But I felt it was highly rear view focused. Yes the returns and performance has been good, but this is a highly levered capital intensive company facing shrinking demand for its core product, cable TV, all the while they must continue to invest huge sums of capital to stay relevant as 5G rolls out, yet I fail to see how Universal, and their various TV properties would be able to compensate for cord cutting, higher rebroadcast and distribution fees. I have an eighteen year old son, who NEVER watches TV, this is what Comcast is facing.  As for the FCC saving the day, its still possible for congress to step in and legislate Net Neutrality over-riding the FCC, having the FCC save them would not be the basis upon which I would invest in Comcast.When I look at forward consensus estimates, from Y-Charts, and compare them to the companies own 5 year historic valuation metrics, its hard to see material undervaluation. EV/EBITDA forward 8.41 vs 8.18 (5 yr avg), EV/Rev 3.05 vs 2.72, PS 37.5 vs 27.4, PE 17.7 vs 18.4, only on PEG 1.3x vs 1.9 do the shares look substantially undervalued, on the rest the shares look over valued or slightly undervalued. Finally, according to Y-Charts there are 22 buy, 8 outperform and 4 hold recommendations without a single sell. Short interest stands at 61.22m vs its 5 yr average of 85.42, so to me, its hard to see how this is a contrarian bet?So here is where I will follow Warren Buffet, over the highly respected Steve Mandel, where I avoid highly levered capital intensive companies with difficult forward trends that are very hard to really quantify the future.Thanks much for your thoughts!",

"Why are the buybacks important? Cash is leaving the company, P/E decreases but P/B increases, isn't that the case? So after the buyback, the remaining shareholders have a bigger share of a smaller company and without the buyback they would have the same share of a bigger company because cash/share is then added to the stock price. So they are neutral.  There is inflation which slowly decreases the value of cash but if the money can be deployed on acquisitions it might generate a bigger return over time.",
"I hold shares of both DG and DLTR.  I agree that they're both really useful as hedges against more volatile portions of your portfolio - their revenues tend to be a lot more stable.  A few thoughts:1) You indicate customers at these stores aren't shopping online due to not being accustomed to technology.  I think it's more a matter of price point and convenience.  When I wanted to purchase a few envelopes to send a letter, I can get some inexpensive ones at a dollar store (for a dollar).  If I need to send a letter, I'm not going to check Amazon and order envelopes, especially since at that price point, they're an add-on item.2) 11% seems like a really high WACC if you're purchasing due to their relative safety in a (market) storm.  GuruFocus and other online sources (not that I'd just use theirs) put it at closer to 6%.3) Technical analysis misses the tax cut.  With falling tax rates, prices should properly rise.  Your silent partner just decided to take 21% instead of 35%.  That's more for the rest of us.",

"McDonald´s is making excellent progress, now imagine that they did come outwith a new magic health burger, and everything but you had to wait 2 hours to get it, wellif I am hungry just no time to wait, that is how it is.

"FT. just a further comment on Tesla and the electric vehicle. We discussed earlier the new developments of battery capacity, charge ups and so on but thebottom line is that even with a fast charge up system in place it is still very much non-competitive of simply driving up to the gas station and fill your tank.Because of this problem Tesla will never have what you call first mover advantage, ie. the first with the ballpoint pen could sell them for about 80 dollars a piece.So what will happen? My prediction is that Tesla will eventually declare bankruptcy, of course China and the other car manufacturers will continue to launch the electric vehicles, but Tesla is running fast out of money and it is just a time before, well just to help you out on this one, IMHO",
"What is happening right now???a. look at the price war per se in the wind sector, how wind today comes at a much lower costper unit of electricity than just a year ago.b. look at the cost to ship a container from Hamburg today to let say Singapore. c. look at the cost reductions of natural gasImagine the CEO of Vestas, saying, oh yea, these are tough times we will have 2016 prices back in 2 years times, he is saying we are behind a bit, yes, but we will catch up fast and now institute the changes needed to say profitable, maybe at a lower rate but still quite profitable.Business and business success is economic warfare - that is what next, the off-shore needsa much stronger profile of going to war and win economically with new management styles and new programs. Yes the ways and means of the new son.",
"My best prognosis is that yes, of course Shale has had a profound impact on the pricedevelopment of oil and to get it out of the ground, no one can argue against that, but if it was not for Shale it would be something else, that is how globalism and capitalism works, new ways and new ways to cut costs and new ways to get the stuff out of the ground. So we are back to the basics again, a Industry can complain and complain, yes, but give them one year of benefit of the doubt, second year, you must adapt, you must change to meet the new era of what is going on and when you write in your financial statements, "" we are well equipped towithstand these difficult times and we now have 2.3 billion in reserve"" wow, completely out of date, and that  has and is the problem at large with these off-shore. wow, are they ever slow in adapting to reality. Borr drilling seems to be the new man , the son, and I think we will see wonderful things out of them. How the rest will fare. Well?? give them a year or 2 more and yes, they will not disappear but management will be different.",
"Now what?? I come equipped with a bit more solid , expanding and forward looking piece of discourse than of the past. Actually, I have borrowed from the chairman of Borr drilling and I do agree with him and hopefully his words will translate into an actual and company action plan, vs. just using the right words.So far IMHO most of articles written on behalf of the off-shore, for this industry or against the industry to me, yes, very narrow in scope and we can take most of 2014 and forward to now, little change all in all, but this is what is really happening behind the scenes of some of the off-shore and hopefully it will gain more momentum.So what is next?  A rough example, I  grow apples - sell them 10 dollars a piece because I own 30% of apple country, and force people into buying them, why do they?? because they have no other choice, really. But here is then the 48 dollar question?+ Where is the alignment between my price and the need of the buyers??? best answer, none at all, I don´s really care, give me 10 dollars a piece and I will bring champagne to the owners - like this company and high dividends. but where does that end??? Crash and a big crash.So the upstart is where can we align ourselves the best way to our customers? what are their needs and how can we share in the value of our services??? Oh day rate of 450,000 oh yea, good good, and 30 million cancellation. oh. yea, like a shout from the wrestling arena, but how does that serve the customer???. completely out of whack and that is why we are seeing what we are seeing today, so yes, Borr drilling is saying, now how can we best align ourselves with the needs of ourcustomers??? yes, we can join forces other companies, joint ventures, how can we fill the need of Schlumberger, how can we Maersk fill the need of a joint venture agreement with Borr, and Borr is using a strategy of the son, not of the old man whose times is of the past, and yes, how can we as a low cost producer match prices of our competition? So this new alignment is ""what is next"" it is coming and it is throwing away the old management style of saying oh yea, we have this 1 billion dollars in standby credit and we will survive because 2013 will be back in 2019. Sorry it will not happen, and why the problems of the past??These companies have been extremely slow, very slow, out of touch with the basicbusiness concept of adaptability, and that I believe Borr is doing, we are changing into a new management style, a style of close alignment of customers needs,  let us see  what happens, but the old ones will not be the leaders. Let us hope they are already looking fornew leadership in all of the board rooms.or these articles oh no, this day rate of 130,000 per day is not profitable and this is the bottom line and no, we cannot do it, and so on, well, all we can do is really pray for that kind of business profile, like JF going into retirement believing that 700.000 million is still right for this rig and yes I can get a day rate of 500,000 next year. Well, what we we say really.",
"and of course on the electric vehicle the government of Norway can easily throw enough money into the industry and Tesla claim success but it is still a result made of sand because what happens when you dont have the large subsidies etc. and yes, China too can sport success to come but again only with billions investments to be made into its infrastructure but still a regional example.What is the problem with the EV. Well, all the experts and all the promotion can say this and that, but still, this vehicle must come with a charge up of energy that is just as fast as the fossil driven autos. Can you imagine the man saying to his wife, ""sorry dear we have to wait for the Thanksgiving turkey because my no. 3 needs the energy all day long"".sorry I have to get up, 2am I forget to start my recharge.my sons were up all night long with my 2 Teslas, home  and forgot to start the recharge,fleet of cars being stuck in Kirland lake minus 50 degrees and not a Tesla will start.just some basic things,But having said that the whole success has to be a process of bottom up change and culture, now we have a top heavy top, eg. government subsidies, etc. short term results but when other needs comes in, for the elderly, hospital etc. is it not much better to invest in those than force people to buy EV IMHO",
"Culture Definitions. A true story.At the bank we had this client, fairly large line of credit but somehow the company could not really generate real profits, but remember the manager at the time wrote pages and pages of reviews and everything, but all in all why was this company not really progressing what were the underlying factors??Manager of this Dept. really did respect him because he was able to detect things outside of the box, like when you visit a new company, split second impressions, how things are.Anyways, this is what he said about what troubled him. The owner was Harvard MBA, top of the line business acumen, as we all know, but the problem, the real problem was that when he came to work every day he still Dressed up like an MBA professor, white shirt and tie, while he business was at the ground level - let us say grow flowers, plants for resale.So when we look at companies we are not really looking at the backlog, balance sheet but really who are the executives, who are the board members and who are they and where do they really come from. Warren Buffett - Sam Walton - and many others good examples, lol, like this university professor who claimed that poor people here in Dk go to McDonalds, lol, did a study and saw many professors there so his perception did beg the question.And over the years many companies have seen amazing turnaround and how? top management locate their office in the midst of the production lines, per se, so everyone can see them, etc. while others bury themselves in glass ivory towers with their own dining and washrooms - and they dispatch 100 of memos of team work etc. but are really in a chain of constrictions because of a culture in themselves.",
"Thank you FT, Tesla had quite the show at Copenhagen airport, nice looking car really and thousands walked by, I did have the time and could have gone up there, 3 sales representatives, looked like the new upcoming brand of CEO, and I do have all this information from electric engineers and something about the new truck- have about 1000 kg. of battery etc. and when up in North Bay, Ontario. pretty cold minus 30, now -  all these ev with up to maybe78% reduction in el because of extreme cold, etc.but we can go on and on but what do we have really with Tesla??From the airport promotion investment, and so on, yes, all these drivers of EV today maybe they are all prototypes of test and research , ok. okbut Tesla is producing an dynamic environment, they are out there, strong promotion, strongmandate and yes, they are burning millions and yes, is the stock overvalued, yes, think so by about 50% but does not make any difference really.they are dynamic, creasing dynamic in the populations and they are promoting and paying for the promotion, and that iswhat we need with the New off-shore - a new dynamic way of presentation, a new profileand yes, like you say all the time we are in a new era, yes, but what are they really doingto make it happen it this new era??? Can the older generation do it, sorry, No we musthave the new generation of the digital world that is part of them, not something that the olderdo etc. because it is needed. It must be the lifeblood, that is why the younger generation are the leaders of tomorrow, and we must allow them to be an important part of our future.",
"FT. you recent article on Noble and your voice of ""disappointment"" and yes, all inall your voice is representative of the whole off-shore industry, currently and seeminglythe same pattern .. and this has nothing to do with the surge of shale or supply and demand fundamentals really, no, there is something else going on and what is it??And then we have these voices of stock prices are now up, dont buy, now they are low now buy and now yes sell and yes, opec and shale and demand and supply and EV will take over and still 30% comes from off-shore and we can be happy because this is just temporary and tomorrow, the light will not be at end of the tunnel, but we will have the sun there.Maersk recently joined forces with IBM - a specific program, -- why, to create a new image, a new dosis of enthusiasm, new ways and means, new investment, invest for today and tomorrow, new digital applications, like at the airports new ways to check in and out, and so on.That is what is missing from the off-shore - still, in a kind of paralysis because this cyclical is not working the Way it should. contracts are not working they way they should, oh. yea, we are strong we have 1.67 billion in reserve, so we can wait, for full recovery??? I meanwhat recovery??? what we have is WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.What to do??? 50% of all board members get out, get in new 50% who are recent graduates of todays business environments, we must have a new dynamic profile of these off-shore drillers. They are fading away, the old school never lasts, coming to an end, I am looking forward in seeing who will take over into the new era.

"FT: A Little off topic if I may: You were correct about Europe putting enough pressure on Trump to keep him from reinstating (nuclear deal) sanctions on Iran. Venezuela is the next biggest potential wild card. Hopefully, regular citizens can flee to a better place.",
I’m surprised that drillers (and oil) keep going up without a retracement yet...its been 3 days I’m waiting for a correction. Went short on ESV for a quick trade. Hope no contract is announced during the weekend! It wasnt a very smart move...,
So far for the past 3 years the Oil moves never had any staying power.. They always pulled back.. Is this time any different?.. We'll soon find out..,
"2 days after selling 50% almost did not change the price of 11 stocks I had and still hold 50% . Average ""gain"" (actually no loss) is 2% for not holding those stocks. Let's wait and see. As for OSV and OSD perception I agree in general but no entirely. A tide should bring up all ships. The thesis ""OSD especially translates to a ""sell-on-rally"" type and OSV ""hold-on-rally"" suggests in fact a short sale. If oil stays in 64-65 range OSD and OSV as the most undervalued part of oil-related stocks will probably go higher due to a simple fact - they depend rather on oil price STABILITY than on actual oil price.",
"FT,I tend to look at the broad picture of things. The OSD sector relies upon (new) drilling - shares prices are shooting up ATM but mainly because oil itself is up, while the reality is that the number of new contracts are limited and OSD finances remain stretched. OSVs on the other hand are in demand as long as an offshore platform is operating (ie. business is not reliant on new drilling only) - and there, of course, remain many platforms in operation. Does it not make sense that, fundamentally anyway, ATM the money should be in OSVs before OSDs? Of course one needs to consider matters such as current over-supply etc - but at least the market sector is actively functioning, unlike with the drilling sector? However this is not reflected in much of the market pricing (eg while the price of ESV or NE shoots up, TDW is increasing slowly).Or am I missing something?",
Sold some more of my ESV and sold some contracts against my Oil services ETF's to lock in a decent amount of profits.. I may miss out on the long term triple bagger but I'm not going to sit by idling and not take advantage of this Oil run.. I'm still long a few shares just in case.. GL Longs I hope this run continues..,

"The Canadian banking system with 5 large chartered banks are not the epitome of perfection but over the years they have proven very stable, the people that I have worked with have all been with it, in my estimation and what really paved their way for success is early recognition of problems and when seen, a kind of immediate action to correct, take the losses, write off bad debts so to speak. This oil language of things will be better tomorrow, etc. well, did not come across in the Banking world, we must do something of action right now, because when we let things slide, just gets worse and worse.So I know everything about stop loss, whether professional or naive investor everyone seems to be an expert on stop loss. and good stuff, have read multiple of books etc. on investments. So in the bank we had 22.3% of all deposits , now should they drop to 21.9% wow, hell broke lose, campaigns, offer for new accounts at that time, etc. we must correct this NOW, NOT TOMORROW.so with Off-shore their life-blood is backlog - new renewal contracts etc. and let us say starting out 13.bilion in backlog, now this goes down to 11 billion, unacceptable, this is our stop loss, we must do something now, fast and quickly, no stumbling around, we must make corrective action now, But no. deposits slide from 22% to 20% to 15%, oh well, go hone, have a beer, things are cyclical KSA will fix he problems tomorrow,so here we have it, really backlogs what were they on January 1, 2014 of all the off-shoreand how much were they as at January 1, 2018. I mean where is the stop loss on this developmebnt. Are they not MBA oil experts, have every expert at their hands and still, nojust let backlog slide and sorry ups. now chapter 11 and bankruptcy.So backlog is down 20% what to do?? everything is good except doing nothing, cuttiong costs will not solve the problem, merge with another company, sell assets, get rid of debt, get rid of personnel, cut down on office supplies, sell out to another company, sure maybe lose 59% of market share prices, but is that not better than losing 90%.or what about 98%.So there we have it, an ineffective industry, really, all in all, still in the old mode of old daysof where things will turn around, just watch riggs reduction etc. KSA cannot pay their workers, etc. and we will wait for better days. Sorry, all we can do is really pray and what is next a good dosis of prayers would help.The industry is not disappearing, of course not, but what we have today, all in all is noteffective, not really profitable and immediate action is necessary to pave the way for a profitable future.and of course, we are doing everything possible, well, that is not good enough, you mustreally make some drastic changes, macro changes and make macro decisions, because tomorrow oil prices will  not save you. the whole environment has changed.",
"Thank you FT, positive and direct, much appreciated.Ok, now let us step up our process of extreme critical thinking.""apples are in very extremely demand, supply has gone to whack, like a bit when Forrest Gumpmade his first millions on shrimp, all of the other shrimp boats were lost in the storm, he surviced because he stayed on the high sea"" I am a Forrest Gump not in shrimp but in apples and a bushel sells for multiply times more (just like the craze on bitcoins etc.) than 2 years. ago. I go and axpand as crazy and believe in ""cycles of the industry"" whatever.so I invest 500,000 million in production equipment, and low and behold I acquire 30% of the markets for applies in the world. But no, I need this heavy picker for 1 billion so I also pick it up, a lot of debt, but wow with these apple prices, (hmm. cyclical prices but I am good, really good)The other world growers during my success were able to sustain the other 70% of demand for apples.Now, this high tech Chinise student comes up with a new digital version of apple technique, investment community, wall street thow in their billions and wow, I still have 30% but the other 70% still met by the other growers, sales per bushes is just a miniscule of what it was when I had the advantage, and now my god I am stuck with this machinery for over 1.5 billionwhatever it took some of the other growers are bringing in 10000 Mexicans every year to pick their apples for a fraction of the cost of my heavy equipment.So can we not say in conclusion, really, that these oil prices whether cyclical or not, just a way of economic definition but when you have just me investing 1.5 billion , imagine that the 5 others also invest those billions in this heavy equipment and expensive equipment, how in the whole wide world can anything really pick up the costs and pay for it. So the whole industry got out of whack in 2013 and 2014, just like a Forrest Gump reaping in a one time ""lottery ticket"" because all the other ones really got lost in the mail,so all in all what we have today is not a consequence of high or low oil prices, really, all the CEO who proclaims, ""cyclical"" has nothing to do with it, really, so if the argument is true of oil cycles, ok, then how in the heck can anyone substantiate spending 20 billions on hardware in equipment, with a normal payout of let us say 15 years when decisions are made on the unreal scenario of current oil prices, like the above in apples.In other words, oil prices can stay at this level, day rates will not really increase that much really, becasuse it is wishful thinking that Forrest Gump thinking will ever return, nothing ever really get back to what it was because of these smart computer women and men of our new generation. So in other words, all of these assets of the high prices of 2013 and 2014, all in all no flow of funds really will ever be able to pay for them and also pay the stakeholders their due reward for their investments.Debt levels of today while everyone argues that they are manageable, ok they are but where is the real energy for real renewals, and investments and at the time substantial write-downs and write-offs. I dont accept the argument that for off-shore their cause of problem is because of ""cyclical matters"" not in this instance, it is a cause of too much debt incurred at a time whether or not oil prices were low or high, in the long run simply unsustainable and does not really reflectpoor management, no, but a kind of management that just is out of whack today and will be for some time yet, unless we have a true wake-up call in the board rooms all over.",
"Hi Fun, Thanks for your article/work. Great.Just a small point, In Point 3 - Net Debt, it would have been more useful if the debt was related to something.  (like EBITDA or backlog or something along those lines). Total debt in itself is meaningless.  I am looking into getting some exposure in the oil services field. The good thing about SDLP is that you do get paid, whilst you wait for a (possible) recovery. No other OSD do that, except SFL, which in itself is not a drilling company, but you do get exposure through the 4 rigs they own. The beauty of SFL is that you get diversification - should this recovery take longer then anticipated.Best regardsLasse",
"When you have a book value of assets belonging to any company or anywhere in the world and these assets at cost or with basic accounting principles total about 20 billion dollars and because of downturns etc. the market applies its own applications of market capitalization to these assets and come up with let us say 1.5 billion or even lesser than that, similarly today an up to date assets with digital formations off shore drill ship could easily cost 600 million dollars and just take 2 of them and you have a book value of about 1.2 billion and then suddenly the market says, things are bad here so capitalization is only 100 million dollars.so when we add up the book value of subject major off-shore driller - we can take Seadrill before it really got bad, about 20billion --together with  Transocean and the others and together the industry shows a book value of let us say, 57 billion vs. a capitalization of lessthan 9 billion - well, nothing to write home about but the emperor definitely has no clothes on here, Are we not really in a state of depression, and with all due respect when I read about the new CEO of Noble, I mean honestly and truly is that the best they can come up with. would have been much happier to have seen a kind of Bill Gates or Buffet or silicone valley step in but an old corporate secretary, my god give us a break and all we can do is pray.I am in lightly with all the off-shore because what will happen??? we just dont know, and I find the exercise worthwhile and really appreciate and enjoy FT and his views and being sucha hard working professional.  But no doubt about it this industry is in a major depression still even with higher oil prices and things will start to give in sooner or later. But status quo will prevail and bit longer but not for the next 2 years. IMHO",
"Thanks SO MUCH for this comparison  article Fun!!!I found it very informative to see all the companies side by side and the links to the more detailed articles so handy was very thoughtful as well.I've been watching with some disbelief as the oil price has been driven so high!  It does not seem to be supported by any kind of fundamentals.  When it turns downward, do you see it goig to 58?  Or is that the first drop before it goes back up to it's double top?  And then where do you think it lands?-srockaz",
"FT - in conclusion, when you have one serious downturn - they all say a cyclical business yes,but one serious and prolonged downturn which they have had to live with, I mean take the large energy companies yes, lot of bankruptcies, yes, part of the real business world but just imagine that all the others have suffered and gone down like the off-shore industry, I mean to have suffered so much and to have lost so much of their original high capitalization, I mean,that says everything, they are much too weak financially speaking, otherwise, sure lose 30%of your equity, maybe even 50% but when you go down 90% or more, wow, the wholefundamental structure, is much much too weak.",
"Shale in the US will eventually end up like the capital of Indonesia  Jakarta. The city is sinking  far below sea level and endangering some 15 million people.

So the shale of course will continue to ""prosper"" under the current administration but this will change in 2020 and the damage done by that time cannot be recovered, first the landscape of these drillers and wells will create a disaster magnified bychemicals in the drinking water and we have a man made catastrophe here.

"So now what? this is for macro- scopic purpose per se, not anything to do with feelings, personal investment losses, regurgitation of Seadrill management etc. but a way toclarify my position on what is next. My losses and billions of losses in the off-shore of the past where companies basically ""survival  in the short run by living off the fat of the past - backlogs""those for most of them these backlogs are gone, cannot be recovered. Thus I cannot recover my losses by saying oh yea, Transocean will give me 50,000 dollars back in profit and so on, just a matter of conjecture.a. what will happen now is basically ""nothing"" because with cost cutting and of course things done companies such as Diamond, Rowan, the new Seadrill have a management (from the old school) oil prices are up, and we are coming out with these fantastic and optimistic day rates etc.  Good old times will return, but sorry They will not because of the losses of the past and management procedures of the next 10 years no matter what anyone hopes for will not be the same. b. So nothing will happen in the immediate arena of changes but in time - management again must wake up and face the shareholders, investors, wall street and those who have the billions to invest and come with terms, wait a minute these oil prices are now high enough, have been high enough, but, hmm. our share price is not going up accordingly, we are hanging in there but there is no real dynamics going on, nothing exciting is going on andthis paralysis will continue. But enough pressure from the market and investment community#will force the smaller companies to throw in the towel, they will be taken over by larger companies, - not that they are not surviving, per se, but THEY are not competitive, not making any money, cannot pay dividends, in other words they cannot sustained in the market place.They will be taken over by larger and robust off shore drillers and other energy companies.These trend will continue for let say another 2 to 3 years and eventually we will have no morethan 2 or 3 large off-shore drillers with real financial muscle, fully digital intergrated and superior with costs and lower cost base than eg. shale. So right now, yes, stock prices will go up, yes, and for the smaller off shore drillers they will keep on struggling on until they do realize that they are not meeting the requirements of todays better environment, because why?? simply they are too small in this environment and while there were room for maybe 8 drillers in the past, there is no more room than for 3 today in my estimation. It will take time for further consolidations and mergers but they will come, because the old school is not profitable and hoping that things will be like the good old days is just wishful thinking. A new reality will set in, take time but it will come.",

"For a company to be successful, profitable and let us say pay out a dividend, and in the short run there is no excuse of not paying the stakeholders, the owners of a company, either profits are re-invested into a company and its share price goes up accordingly or profits are distributed to its owners. For all years I worked with major bank in Canada, policy was to pay out one third of profits to the shareholders, and do so consistently.

Now I have already spent some time in reviewing predictions and projections and there are so many sharp pencils out there of Seadrill and its demise and a kind of false celebration of being right, well, we need just a bit more than that then a celebration of too much debt and lack of income and the results of an equation solved,does not do very much really, in my estimation.So, Now what??Polls and so on from 2013 were nearly all wrong, every polster on the US election results were also wrong, and my start is that nearly all of the projections and forecasts so far from very talented writers here, sorry, my call is that those are also wrong, so can we come upwith something different.

I do not agree with taking a profit mood. It is easy to see that almost all oil-related stocks including DW drillers hugely UNDER PERFORMED vs. oil price rally. For example 11 months ago when crude oil was in 52-53 range RIG shares were traded for $16. Now they are below 12. Same for all others. Either the market anticipates a serious retracement in oil price or stocks will catch up. I consider it as 50:50. In the other words it would have been prudent to sell 30-50% of positions in a hope to re buy them cheaper and leave in play remaining 50-70%.,

jcgo: The way I see it....Blend and Extend by definition is good for oil prices because it increases utilization. When we get to 80-85% utilization - the smart $$ won't wait for day rate increases - OSD's go higher at that point on the assumption that increased day rates will follow. we've seen this movie before.,
Blend and extend may be a good strategy to lock in a good rig for a number of years at today’s rate before the oil price pushes the day rate higher.,

VZ - Thank you for the quick update.  Agree with Waltzy's comments here.  Don't you think the contract award cycle will take some time to play out?   Its not nearly as automatic as increased oil prices would be for an oil producer.  What is the typical strongest award season for OSD?  Is it 1Q of each year after capital budgets have been set for oil majors?  Appreciate you contribution.  GLTA,
"Maybe add a rig (at a much lower, almost break even, rate) as a way of blending+extending.",
"I am wondering why Total hasn't approached Ensco earlier in the cycle but still think this is a very special case as this particular rig is contracted at one of the highest dayrates ever on record and clearly is a thorn in the side of each Total executive looking at the company's contracted rig fleet. Lowering the dayrate by 50% in exchange for a contract extension would save Total more than $100 million in annual cash flows over the next two years.Terminating the contract would only save half of that amount annually BUT Total wouldn't incur any further spread costs on the rig which would actually lead to even higher overall savings.If Total indeed choses to terminate the contract for convenience instead of employing the rig further after 2020, this would be telling volumes about the true condition of the deepwater space and the intentions of supermajors.Paying for NOT DRILLING at current oil prices would be a huge negative surprise.",

I am with you I need to see more work but I do think the oil majors will move very cautiously back to drilling.,

"""While it can be argued Austedo may have a slight edge over Ingrezza with efficacy"". actually, Ingrezza is the more effective candidate for TD.

Although, at first glance, austedo may be ""slightly more effective"", it actually isn't. Let me explain, lets look at the Kinect 3 extension study, where we can compare the equivalent timeframe of 12 weeks. The reduction in AIMS for Ingrezza in the extension study is -4.3 which is a one whole point further reduction in involuntary movements than Austedo's -3.3. This clearly shows ingrezza as the more effective candidate. However, you can make a case for austedo when comparing the secondary endpoint, the CGI scale.. even so, thats not enough to say Austedo> ingrezza in efficacy.

"""This year, Valeant gave a preview of its upcoming presentation, which will feature this year's bombshell announcement of 7 key new products producing over $1 billion in expected combined annualized revenues at peak sales over the next 5 years from under $100 million in revenue today.""IMHO the key word is ""peak sales"".  I guess the abovementioned products need some time to ramp up, so on average you should rather expect half of that ($500m annually) or even less over the next five years. Nonetheless, as those products just hit the market and there apparently have been no looming patent issues yet, I don't expect sales to fall off a cliff after peak sales either.Maybe the only message management tried to deliver was that they are pretty confident that those products will be significant contributors over the next five years, but don't want to overcommit. Given the inherent uncertainties concerning marketing sucess and competition from potential generics and next generation products, they neither want to pinpoint precise revenue estimates or growth rates, nor project revenue growth for longer than five years.Barring any contribution from Xifaxan and B&L growth, I would rather expect $900m-$1b FCF, plus about $200m annual contribution from new products ($500m revenue * 40%  margin after-tax).",

The run rate of annual cash flow from operations is well under $2B.The rescheduled debt repayment over the next five years is $11.2B.

"I think Vyzulta and IDP118 will be the top 2 products of the 7. Xifaxan revenues alone will likely be up $250m+ YoY for 2018, because 2017 was a disaster and the sales force is gaining momentum, which makes up for most 2017 divestitures (-$200m EBITDA). I think the guidance will be $3.3bn or higher when factoring in -$300m max LOEs + 7 key products - $150m derm rev + Xifaxan + B&L.Retail investors on SA are factoring in a kitchen sink guidance. The CEO is not hinting at low expectations for 2018 guidance, last year the CEO and CFO both hinted low guidance. Therefore I am holding all shares for 2018 and I think the guidance will be street expectations of $3300 EBITDA or higher. This gives us a 10 EV/EBITDA for 2018. I probably won't sell for less than 13 EV/EBITDA when B&L is growing.",

They are still young and need money, to launch a customer service for example, or develop apps, buy ads, or even get in the theatre biz ;). AMC are being selfish, this is so win win even in the long term!  They should do math instead of being stubborn.",
"At this point, ask yourself this: name another subscription service that added 1.5 million subscribers so fast. They are going to be able to force partnerships with movie theatres. In the short run, AMC will benefit. In the long run, Moviepass will force AMC to partner up or lose their subscriber base, which by then will be 6 million.",
"Really don't like HMNY but I have a long position in it...I don't understand tech and see it a waste of my time to pursue something that will be antiquated by the time I understand it and 'everyone else' has moved on to another frivolous way of doing the same thing we've been doing for thousands of years without this crap, but I do have a grasp for how people flock to things and away from them, I see HMNY as a bullish position, oddly.The magic phrase Blockchain may be the reason HMNY jumped today but the sub numbers are the core measurement of this business model and they will continue to be compared to NFLX early days, which Moviepass is currently exceeding.  In a normal world this would mean HMNY would climb back up like a scalded cat and end of day volume would show institutional activity....which there isnt a lot of.  Other metrics currently do not have as much impact on the markets' mind as the subs and there is little reason to believe many will look beyond the sub numbers because this is not a stock that is being played with by savvy money....yetAMZN has always blown my mind and I will not buy it until I see it take a huge hit, but HMNY is the stock for all the people who missed NFLX, AMZN, etc etc etc.  The whole blockchain frenzy is because of the previous dot com successes and everyone looking for a repeat.  If such stupidity can occur again and again, you got to ask why it is happening indefinitely and that is because there isn't a much better game in town at the moment than stocks.  How many people really suffered since 2009? And I mean really hurt....not that many, so the idea of a market crash in many people's minds isn't fresh, it never really happened, they had their smart phones to comfort them the whole time, their facebook networks, etc....their wasn't enough pain to know what pain is at a collective level.The sidelined money that hasn't participated in the last 9 years and millenials whose only idea of investments are tech things like sharing services, rentals, and whatever....is a recipe for buying time for shaky Jakes like blockchain and Moviepass to only gain more traction.At this point I wouldn't short any of these things: valuation of blue chips isn't high enough, T-bills and bonds are no place to look for a return, energy and commodities haven't really taken off and the frenzy in blockchain is a bit ironic because its a massive unconscious appeal for a better currency.  In all that, productive assets are the most stable bet, or writing articles about the stock du jour.",
How can they get $10 per person per month for moviegoing data ?,
Multiple revenue streams  ... Ted said before he and Mitch started to chuckle and get giggly ... hmmm; now this comes out:   http://bit.ly/2Fp2CRR,
I did not care about the crypto mania craze surrounding this stock now.  I have been watching it for weeks and then bought based on the growth due to movie pass.  That is the stock attraction.  I could care less if the movie pass is paid for by bitcoin or rose peddles.  I bought  for the tangible product they offer - movie pass.,
"Mitch Lowe gave more ICO details today on Bloomberg TV. The idea of rewarding MoviePass subscribers with MoviePass coins for giving reviews, recommending films, etc. sounds like a great way of rewarding helpful customers. I'm guessing the MoviePass coins could be redeemed for subscription savings and perhaps other savings down the road. https://bloom.bg/2Fsxd1a",
"Why every new business focused on subscriber growth model and huge cash burn, wants itself to compare with nothing but AMZN? ONLY If you check ""unlisted stocks"" lists, i.e. tickers that came and went away from nasdaq/nyse since AMZN started trading, you will get better picture. Any way, I have my shorts at avg price $12 and will cover it at ZERO or when 3 weeks consistently hmny closes above $12. yes, the bar is that low.

I could understand someone taking a short position in this stock when it was trading at $30 or more after making a 10x move higher but certainly not at these prices.  The company may be losing money but the subscriber growth in Moviepass has been nothing short of amazing.  If the company can successfully turn those losses into positive cash and eventual profits the stock could be revisiting those highs.  In my opinion there are other stocks in this market that are much lower risk short candidates.The ICO and crypto news are just noise.  This company doesn't need that to be successful.  Management should focus on the golden opportunity they have in front of them.,
May I ask how do you know that Ted planned this PR stunt to allow the secondary buyers to sell shares?  Did they sell those shares today?  Did you watch the interview before you wrote this?  The interview was over and the interviewer was moving on to the next interview about digital coin and decided to ask Ted if they have ever considered an ICO.  You should probably retract some of what you said above.,

Farnsworth only mentioned crypto because the Jen specifically asked him “have you guys considered an ico amidst the crypto hype.” So transparently biased is your work it’s disgusting. How big is your short position, actually.",
"Can you please at least spend some more time researching the company before you post your article to mislead people? At least you should watch yesterday's entire interview video.

"During the time of the last offering the stock was trading in a range of 7 to 9 bucks. 6.50 per share to an insider round of investing isn't that crazy.

Yawn,
"These are my very rough calculations of MoviePass financials since the introduction of the $10 plan through December. I based them off the average nationwide ticket price ($9), the subscriber growth rate estimates provided by MoviePass (adding 250,000 subscribers per month after the initial 600,000 total in the first two months), and the average MoviePass subscriber attendance numbers provided by the HMNY CEO in an interview (three movies first month, two movies the second month, and about one movie each month after that).I don't know how many signed up for or switched to the November $90 yearly deal so I guessed 100,000. December saw a much larger than average number of sign-ups due to gift subscriptions and the Costco deal. I estimated an extra 300,000 subscribers added in the month of December on top of the normal 250,000 added per month because that would give them 1.4 million subscribers through December (they announced having 1.5 million subscribers on January 9th). I also don't know the December sign-up breakdown between new month-to-month subscribers, Costco yearly subscribers, and gift subscription subscribers so I guessed 200,000 month-to-month, 300,000 yearly Costco, and 50,000 yearly gift subscription subscribers (years worth purchased in some combination of 3, 6 or 12 months). I also don't know how much MoviePass pockets in that $90 Costco deal so I guessed $60. I also estimated 3 months of operating expenses to be about $5,000,000 based on the previous quarterly report operating expenses of about $3,000,000.End of September 300,000 monthly subscribers.300,000 seeing 3 movies in the month = $8,100,000Month Movie Cost = $8,100,000Month Subscriber Revenue = $3,000,000Month Loss = $5,100,000End of October 600,000 monthly subscribers.300,000 seeing 3 movies in the month = $8,100,000300,000 seeing 2 movies in the month = $5,400,000Month Movie Cost = $13,500,000Month Subscriber Revenue = $6,000,000Month Loss = $7,500,000Total Loss = $12,600,000End of November 750,000 monthly subscribers and 100,000 yearly ($90) subscribers.250,000 seeing 3 movies in the month = $6,750,000300,000 seeing 2 movies in the month = $5,400,000300,000 seeing 1 movie in the month = $2,700,000Month Movie Cost = $14,850,000Month Subscriber Revenue = $7,500,000 + $9,000,000 = $16,500,000Month Gain = $1,650,000Total Loss = $10,950,000End of December 950,000 monthly subscribers, 100,000 yearly ($90 already paid subscribers), 300,000 ($60) yearly subscribers, and 50,000 ($120) one-year gift subscription subscribers.550,000 seeing 3 movies in the month = $14,850,000250,000 seeing 2 movies in the month = $4,500,000600,000 seeing 1 movie in the month = $5,400,000Month Movie Cost = $24,750,000Month Subscriber Revenue = $9,500,000 + $18,000,000 + $6,000,000 = $33,500,000Month Gain= $8,750,0003 Months of Operating Expenses = $5,000,000Total Loss = $7,200,000",
Anyone who has questions about Moviepass's business model should simply read this interview with their CEO Mitch Lowe - http://bit.ly/2Fn5kaH.  He spells it all out. Once he gets enough subscribers he'll cut deals with the theater chains.  He's going to make a boatload off the studios since he can use targeted advertising to drive people to movies that they might normally miss.  He's even talking about having Moviepass exclusive showings.,

"XAMD - I do not have any data on mattress sales & I don't recall seeing those numbers being broke out in prior quarterly reports. I share your concerns & suspect these are very low-margin items that take up a lot of floor space. On the other side, they are high-dollar items compared to jeans and sweaters and high-dollar buys often induce the buyer to sign up for the JCP Card to spread out the payment. So there are positive aspects of driving revenue up & earning some card interest! However I again suspect the real key here is trying to win over the Sears customer that may have gone to Sears in past for appliances and mattress & now their Sears store has closed. Once JCP gets them in the door to look at the appliances & mattresses, they have a chance to make them regular customers - buying clothes, towels, toys, etc.!",
Actually I read that their real estate holdings are worth around $5B! However I'm sure they don't want to sell any more than they have to - since that would leave them with lease expenses long-term. I agree with MSM - much of their come-back could ride on the ability to take ownership of the Sears shoppers & they are trying everything possible! They have big sales going on right now for Appliances and Mattresses - going right after Sears's strengths! These  high-ticket items are great starting points with new customers even if the margins are low because many of those buyers get the JCP Credit Card & that buys a little loyalty!,

"Hi Matt, really appreciate your report and opinions shared. I follow your stories quite some time and they are helpful.What I am missing are hidden gem (lithium) from Europe barely known to North Americans. Of course you mentioned European Metals for example, but I am missing more details. So I would be happy to read your report also on that one:My current hidden gem is EUROPEAN LITHIUM (ASX:EUR) - http://bit.ly/2FYgGlF Unfortunately you never mentioned it in the past.Whats so special about it?Well, European Lithium as an Australian explorer who owns a mine in Europe/AUSTRIA. The Austrian mine was build and established by the Austrian Government in the 1980s because they were searching for Uranium for Nuclear Plants. Instead they found Lithium and shut down the mine as it was nothing worth to that time.What I like to emphasize here is, that the mine is very well established. You need to check out the photos. Everything like infrastructure is here. European Car Manufacturers are very close. Why will you take Lithium from South America when you can have it right in front of your door? From the European Lithium mine you literally just need a lorry driver to get the material out of the mountain because the mine goes deep into the mountain already. The infrastructure is ready and the funny thing is, all data is public! There is also historic data available about the content of the mountain since 1980. At the moment EUR is performing further drilling an is working on a PFS and DFS, as it needs to fulfill nowadays JORC reporting standards so big funds and investors are allowed to invest afterwards. So currently the market cap is a joke! Big Funds are not allowed to invest in a stock without a JORC.All data is available and can be verified. Its so transparent compared to most of other Exploreres. I mean, there are a lot of explorers in Canada or South America who do publish information and you can not verify it. Best example was Senator Minerals Inc. They published just nonsense, stock was flying high and then slumped totaly once everybody realized they published fiction.European Lithium instead was established by a f...... government! All infrastructure is available since 1980!  Come on?! Thats a no brainer, isnt it?Check out the Video and you will see how it looks from inside there. Its all transparent: http://bit.ly/2EUcPVtYou may check out also http://bit.ly/2FUMDv8Regarding European Metals:Well, the problem currently is the Czech Government as you stated correctly. They are incapable to form a coalition. A hardliner and nationalist was arguing around to nationalize the European Metals region as they dont like ""foreign companies"" to take advantage of the Lithium held there.Also they argue that European Metals is from Australia but has their jurisdiction at Virgin Islands for tax reasons and so they dont like this at all. Because of this chit-chat from the government the share price slumped. Matt, its correct that European Metals is perhaps one of the largest lithium deposits in the world! The area goes from Czech Republic and reaches out to parts of Germany. Thats enormous! Unfortunately this link is in german but you could use google translator. They estimate the value of the lithium inside the mountain of 87 BILLION US$!! just from the Czech area alone, not mentioned the part on the German side. Link: http://bit.ly/2EWeB8vCurrently the Market Cap is ~70 Mio US$ ... so what the f...? Whats wrong with these figures? I think the politicians are just trying to scare the hell out of the investors so they can participate at low cost.And why is nationlization a complete nonsense? Because Czech Republic is part of the European Union and there is a European Court of Law which absolutely will prevent nationalization of public held companies for no reason. So investors should relax long term.In the end, politicians will BUY in at a dumping price and start to be billionairs later. Thats called capitalism with insider knowledge - and thats even legal. nice.Once this is clarified in the media, just watch the market cap. BOOM!I hold positions in (ASX:EUR) and (ASX:EMH), and I am definitely LONG!",

"Matt,Have you looked at International Battery Metals before? Would appreciate your opinion on this company. Esp. on their accellerated selective Li recovery from brines.",
"Matt, I appreciate all your research confirming the strong position of lithium & cobalt stocks for the next 3-10 years which I only got onto five months ago. I sold SQM and LIT last month at their highs and will get back in when the problems with the Chilean government are clarified. Argentina seems stable for the moment. I'm holding onto 5 cobalt junior miners (ARRRF, CTEQF, ECSIF, FTSSF, and USCFF) non-DRC based which over an average investment period of 91 days have produced a return of 35% (135% annualized). They are limited to no more than 10% of my portfolio, but have already produced 16.5% of my profits. I don't understand Joe Lowry's concern with the exploring miners who are not yet producing. When they start producing, they will have off-take agreements, or get bought out by a major or will collapse because a new/cheaper technology will be found to replace cobalt (like Nano One above).. Yes, they are risky, but the upside potential is huge, and the price of cobalt has already gone from $25 to $37 per pound and will continue to increase especially if the DRC continues to raise the tax on Congo production (e.g. Katanga).",
Silver based batteries are much safer than lithium ones and have much greater energy density. Those chasing after lithium investments might later regret it.,
"Matt,Thanks for breaking these opportunities down relevant to their valuations. The lithium battery market, especially for cars, appears to me to have just as much potential as the beginning of the original combustion engine car market...a second industrial revolution of sorts. I've been a happy camper with LIT the last 6 months since I started following you. Game changing  technology is a major part of these events. So with that said, I would love to see more coverage from you with regards to NNOMF.....it's time. This company has produced just as much worthy news in the last 6 months as any miner and can potentially affect these companies in positive ways, as producing cathodes might be considerably cheaper in the not so very distant future. New markets for Lithium will emerge from this. NNOMF is really only a few steps away with ""due diligence""  being performed right now by certain players in the industry on Nano One's Lithium production process. The recent update on their ""cobalt free"" material is particularly noteworthy. That news woke up a few more people to this company, however, the lack of investor awareness of what is going on here is almost stunning, as well as the lack of understanding of what they really do by those who are aware of Nano One. The easy money on this stock will already have been made by the time contracts are signed by industrial interests to start using their Lithium production process. Nano One is going against the grain (in a positive way) in what you normally see with other micro caps that have great technologies not yet brought to market. They don't have huge debt, they have reasonable outstanding share position, they are well financed, enviable government grants, and have a great bench for a company of this size. More importantly, they are EXECUTING.I think many of the investors that follow you would be happy to see them show up in your monthly updates with regards to explaining what some of these advancements could mean to the overall Lithium battery market and who stands to benefit the most from this new process in producing Lithium batteries.",

"Investing is a matter of deliberation, decisions, and consequent actions; taking the absolute measure of this opportunity and then comparing it relative to the absolute opportunity of another investment possibility. Your commentaries, Bert, help me make my investing decisions; not merely buy, sell, or hold but sell this to buy that, or continue to hold this and avoid that, etc (in all its permutations).Consider, for example, your two commentaries re F5 Networks/FFIV (above) and Twilio/TWLO (last month). It is abundantly clear (to me) that the share prices of both companies will rise but the better opportunity of the two at this particular, peculiar moment is Twilio/TWLO. Oh sure, Twilio/TWLO shares linger at its lows but that behavior I argue (I know) is supine, not prone; its low is in (~$23) and its primary, long-term base now complete. They say they do not ring a bell at the bottom but the bell for TWLO shares is ringing loudly, screaming ""Buy me!"" In sum and in action, I am (have been) a buyer of Twilio/TWLO due in part to your insightful commentary last month. Based in part on your commentary above, I will stand aside on F5/FFIV, but will keep it on my 'watch & wait' list for its own actionable moment. (Which is coming.)Between the commentaries you offer on Seeking Alpha and your amazingly inexpensive Ticker Target subscription service, I am now and have been extraordinarily well-placed to identify alpha for my portfolios. Thank you.",
Terrific analysis... as always... much appreciated.,
"Bert,This is a solid, balanced piece on a company which seems to increasingly be a third rail for analysts and SA writers and commenters.  Although FFIV is not most people's idea of a buy and hold stock, it's been my longest holding, as well as my largest position, initially purchased in the wake of the 2000 tech wreck, and it's up 5-6x during that time, although as you point out correctly, it's gone all of nowhere net over the past several years (although I've done well buying and selling around the edges during that time).  FFIV has had steadily increasing revenues and earnings during my time as a shareholder, with a couple of brief blips down, particularly during the 2008-9 recession, albeit at a slowing pace recently, again noted by you.  This growth and steadiness contrasts to most of its peers in the larger networking group, many of which are nowhere near where they were in the dotcom era (CIEN, CSCO, AKAM, EXTR) or around the same level (CTXS).  While FFIV doesn't pay a dividend, it trades at a below market multiple and is debt free.  Within the overall framework of networking, the company's areas of concentration have shifted nimbly several times against tough competitors, and despite what one writer on SA has described as its ""hardware"" culture, I see no reason why it can't shift its emphasis in that regard more to software as well.If there's a reason for hesitancy at this point, IMO, other than the relative run-up in the past couple of months, it's the company's seeming shakiness at the top in the past couple of years.  Mr. McAdam, a very solid leader IMO, stepped down, hand-picked a successor, then had to come back when that successor committed a vaguely explained transgression.  More recently, Mr. McAdam has retired again, and numerous other members of the executive team have left, most troublingly, relatively young folks not departing for obviously better opportunities; this rarely seems to happen when a company is about to take off.  Further, the company announced about a year ago it was exploring sale opportunities, then nothing further seemed to happen on that despite the stock's undemanding p/e.  Netted out, this remains a buy for me, although I think that the risk may be greater than seems immediately obvious.Long FFIV, EXTR, CTXS, CSCO, ANET",F5 Networks: Is Resurrection Possible?
"Management is very comfortable with debt and they do not plan to pay it off. They have a debt target of 3.5 X EBITDA. If their debt falls below that range, they look to take on debt to invest in growing the business organically, in acquisitions or in stock buybacks.So, yes, refinancing is used to fuel buybacks and acquisitions.",
"Ok, sorry broken record here: the refinancing of the debt is also fuel for the buybacks and canopy venture?",
"Buy before the big guys do is what that proves...aka buy the rumor, sell the news...or at least hold. I don't chase stocks higher, especially ones in a questionable (according to Trump and Sessions) industry. A lot of shakeout to come and will people prefer a liquid, diluted, form?",
And lots of debt to make the acquisitions is factored in to your analysis how Please?Thanks as I have been invested in Stz as often as I could and am trying to decide again. Seems like a lot of debt.,

"Long STZ for its growth and steady returns.  At this price, it's a hold",
"Moreover, in October 2017 Constellation acquired 9.9% of Canopy, with an option to acquire another 9,9%.  Since then, the market price of Canopy (TWMJF) has more than tripled, from about $9.25 per share to over $33 today.",
"Premium branding supported by effective marketing, especially for its Mexican beers, resulted in increased inventory turnover, more shelf space and greater profit margins. Retailers are convinced that they make more money displaying STZ products than competitors' promotional priced beer so the advantage keeps building. Then there is long range planning expanding brewing capacity and glass bottling production, cutting costs and also raising profit margins substantially. A winning formula.Higher cash flow enables more stock buybacks because the stock still is cheap. Read the transcript of the latest earnings conference call. Then there's the investment of just under 10% in Canopy, forward looking to produce and market marijuana with non-alcoholic beverages in Canada, and perhaps elsewhere.",
"There's no reason STZ can't be at $250 by the end of this year barring a market reversal. The company got where it is by buying what it needed to progress. I see no signs that is about to stop. Due to moderating demand, alcohol as a category is going to go through consolidations, and that plays right into Constellation Brands' strong hand. Acquisition could almost be a synonym for Constellation. All it will take is just one announcement of a major acquisition and the stock will be off to the races again. Why is that? While William Darusmont seems to prefer to see what Constellation does as a bad thing for brands, it is a good thing for profits. Since he mentions it, let's talk Mondavi. Constellation took the floundering Mondavi enterprise, which from a business standpoint basically was a poorly run, slipshod organization mainly interested in its next party, and brought fiscal discipline to it. There is no way Robert Mondavi could in his wildest dreams have imagined selling the number of cases of wine with his name on it that Constellation does now. Likewise, there is no way Mondavi could have dreamed of the margins Constellation earns from those sales.It's a theme any investor can see repeated over any number of brand names the company has acquired over the years in the wine, beer and liquor segments. The brand is bought, some immediately throw their hands up and say it is a cheapening and the end of the brand, and then Constellation goes to work, controls costs and winds up pumping out more bottles of (name any of their acquisitions) than ever before and a higher profit margin than the brand ever had previously. You know, if you sell more, then somebody is buying it.That sounds to me like good capitalism. Been playing with this stock and the options on it since the $60 days. I can tell you everybody and their uncle has been singing the Constellation demise song for years. See ""Wine Wars: The Curse of the Blue Nun, The Miracle of Two Buck Chuck, and the Revenge of the Terroirists,"" by Mike Veseth, as just one example of the hand-wringing.So to recap:* Constellation has honed its business model to a keen edge and knows what it is doing;* It has long experience in successfully applying that model over lots of brands and segments;* It has available cash and credit to continue to acquire properties and do it some more. Some people - and especially wine purists - may not LIKE Constellation's business model, but it has plowed for years through a field of naysayers to be the success it is today. No need for the astute investor to worry about the soundness of the investment as long at those three points above remain valid. Hold, buy on the major dips, and collect your dividends. As long as the market stays stable, STZ's story is a good one ahead. And if we should get that major announcement, the sky's the limit.",
Mr. Darasmount -  You could have written the article with all your great background information.  I thought it interesting that Constellation recently took a position in a Canadian Company called Canopy Growth. TWMJF. A CANNABIS company.  With Canada relaxing their laws in June toward recreational useSTZ is exploring the idea of infusing a drink product with Canopy's product.,
"Nicely done on an industry and stock I am knowledgeable in. First, when STZ acquired Mondadvi it was unknown, certainly to me, and to almost everyone. So what did they do? Boost the output of Woodbridge (a brand Mondavi told his sons was his biggest mistake). Prior to the merger STZ had one and only one thing going for it (I don't even think it was publicly held but by acquiring RM they got the corporate shell and an imprimatur). That thing was ""My Wild Irish Rose"" a cheap whiskey, aka rotgut!. But then things changed and STZ took off.They increased production at Woodbridge so the quality was on cheaper but high margin wine. Then recently, they bought the Meomi name and winery from Joe Wagner, son of the owner of Caymus...a top premium wine. BUT the sale did NOT include the vineyards,,,and for $315million in 2015. Meiomi was a big seller at Costco...and I think still is, but it is not the same wine and definitely not from the same grapes.So is it fish or fowl? You decide...I did, long ago and like the author see little upside. Think Two Buck Chuck: if Fred Franzia sold it (the winery that is, Trader Joe's does the selling, over a million of bottles a year), could someone improve on it? No, and they couldn't raise the price by much if at all as TJ is very shrewd.That is not to say they haven't acquired some very good labels which included the vines, but count me out as an investor. I am constantly amazed at the way the stock has performed and wouldn't own it, although I have owned Treasury Wine (TSRYY) which is outperforming and has wide access to the huge growing market in China (or as DJT would say Chi-na),  quality winery(s). Just my not so humble opinion. The market sees it otherwise as any observer can tell...but does that work in the long run...hmmm, has STZ recently peaked?

I suspect part of the problem is the dominance of very smart engineers and scientists at MSFT. The mindset that makes one a great engineer/scientist does not usually lend itself to being a great marketer, which requires, in addition to the analysis of data, insights into more subjective elements in people.

There is a tradeoff between labor and capital. Tesla is, allegedly, trading capital for labor. How is that actually working out? Are they, in fact, in the lead?

The problem is the assumptions. In this case the most outrageous assumption is that 100% of all cars sold in 15 years will be battery/electric. This can only happen by government fiat which while possible is unlikely. Even if this were to occur there would not be enough electrical capacity in most states to charge that many cars.

If 500k still means Tesla loses money, then they will have to tap the markets for money. This is the crux of the bear thesis.

It does not mean, though, that Tesla will be forced into insolvency proceedings.

"I still question whether Tesa's accounting interpretation of gross margin is the same of the rest of the industry. I suspect that there are categories of cost that are not being represented as a COGS when they should be. COGS is primarly made up of costs that are variable in nature, they increase and decrease with production levels. If that were to be the case, Tesla's COGS is being understated causing Gross Margins to be overstated.  Indirect costs and manufacturing overhead costs are being overstated, which are primarily fixed costs in nature. Fixed costs normally do not increase or decrease with production levels. Although the bottom line does not change, the impact of such accounting irregularities can cause both investors and analyst's to misunderstand the company's future income producing abilities and directly impact the value of the company long term.The difference between a company being able to produce 25% gross margins and 15% margins on each automobile produced is huge, especially as production rates increase. Gross margins dictate the level of fixed costs that can be incurred by the company and still be operationally profitable at an acceptable level. If margins are being overstated, management may make capital spending or other fixed costs decisions that they otherwise would not make going forward.My concerns as to potential accounting irregularities primarly stems from ""hearsay"" evidence in the marketplace and not solid analysis of the financials. At this point it is just a concern.I would hope the independent auditors will keep an eye on the characterization of the costs as well as the amount of the costs.Food for thought....",

"Trent;90%  gross margin for the software?I must not understand the definition of gross margin.  That's very possible.  Not a financiaI guy.  I thought gross margin referred to the price of the item minus the variable costs of producing it.  Expressed as a percentage, you would then divide that by the selling price.  There is, for all intents and purposes, no marginal cost to a copy of software.  If Tesla is using the same software (aside from UI) for the Model 3 as for the S&X, that $5000 per car should be nearly pure profit, certainly a great deal higher than a 90% gross margin, unless I am misunderstanding the definition.  It likely costs Tesla pennies at most to load up and turn on the autopilot.  If it costs them as much as a dollar, that would make a gross margin of $4999, or 99.98%.

That's a fact.Now that other major auto manufacturers, internationally, are entering TSLA's business space, the competition is fierce.  All of the major manufacturers are backstopped financially by the sales of non-electric vehicles.  TSLA has no such backstop.  Solar panels and rocket ships can't compete dollar for dollar with these competitors to improve TSLA's competitive position in the EV market.TSLA's sales are going to be subjected to withering competition.

Right now there are around 57 reactors in some state of construction. China, India, and Korea account for roughly half that total.

I would also add that we are seeing a growth in both world population and the world economy. The only clean energy that has the capacity to deal with this growth is Nuclear. Green energies are not capable of matching the output to the growth. Also I am noticing a small but perceivable shift in public opinion on social media about Nuclear to the positive side along with some countries in Europe who had decided to move away from nuclear power changing their minds as costs and realities hit home. The importation of fuels to Japan at massive costs is what has sparked the reopening of nuclear facilities on the scale we are now seeing. They just can't afford not to have it.....and this is in the country where a Tsunami caused a serious Nuclear accident.,
"Good article. Fundamentally sound. So fart it's been a failure for my CCJ investment, except a few short term trades. Japan now depends on Oil and natural gas for most of their electricity (90%?), so it this really sustainable for them, especially given the upbeat trend of oil price? Not sure how all these are going to play out, but if there's any sudden up in oil price, Japan is in big trouble. It's hard to imagine a nation will not ensure its energy safety. Also, China is really building a lot of nuclear plants, and the total yields of these plants way over take those in Japan. So in short, good potential is really there, I think. But when, who knows? This is the enchanting part of investment, isn't it?",
There is a persistent theme in this article that CCJ has some special allure that protects it from malfeasance such as tax fraud.

I am very neutral right now (short term) on where to go with Uranium as the demand factors seem very mixed. I agree that the price is too low but don't see where clear demand has stacked up to change this in the near term. I do believe Uranium will be a big energy source as emerging markets, especially China, ramp up energy demand and production targets. I also believe the much longer term potential tightening in certain fossil fuel energy sources will boost the adoption of more advanced nuclear plants for grid power.

"Micah,I am not sure why you think Cameco is a low cost producer. The CEO has indicated that the current mines resources are being depleted and CCJ needs to invest. However they cannot think about investing without $70/lb uranium. If they need those prices they are not low cost. $32 cost of production is misleading. I think they bought on spot to lower it. And didn't they earn $48 /lb revenue and still earned a loss? So their all in costs had to be at least that much. And they were only earning those revenues due to long term contracts. So when those contracts expire their revenues will decline and losses will grow.Cameco is not a low cost mine.KazAtomProm has the lowest cost production. Berkeley is developing a low cost mine 4.4 mil lbs per annum at $16/lb cost.BHP's Olympic Dam expansion is forecasted to produce 19,000 tonnes per annum (not lbs) in the future as a byproduct (less than $10/lb).Greenland minerals has 593 mil lbs and would produce as a byproduct at $6/lb. Then there is Nexgen which is forecast to produce 28 mil lbs per annum at $10/ lb. There is a lot of production out there to meet demand at costs much lower than what Cameco says is sustainable. Or which could make money at today's spot. I believe there will be a newer lower sustainable price at $40'ish/lb spot to disincentivise new higher cost producers and only newer lower cost production will survive going forward. And that will not include Cameco unless they perhaps acquire the likes of Nexgen.",

"(1). Massive misunderstanding of litigation characterizes the CRA dispute.  The IRS probably settled its case on favorable terms with CCJ since the bill was not large and litigation costs would probably exceed any recoveries.  The CRA and CCJ went to trial and are awaiting a judgement and a sentence.  There will be no settlement.  CCJ can only defer an adverse decision through appeal.  The CCJ argument is weak.  A office in Zug for forwarding provided no economic benefit except avoiding taxes.  Tax authorities always void financial engineering that simply avoids taxes.Have you considered to whom CCJ will sell its uranium?  China and Russia will build all the new reactor builds with a one-stop-shop for all nuclear technology.  Both countries will seek sovereign sources for uranium.  With strong geopolitical influence they will control Kazakhstan’s reserves.

Excellent research and analysis.  I've been through the cycle high and low and I personally believe the spot will increase sooner than expected into the low $40's.  I'm invested in DEN UEC and URE and sold out of CCJ hoping for a lower price in the near future but would happily pick it up again if that doesn't work out.  I did very well in the last run up although it definitely could have been much better.  I think it will be similar this time but slower and more protracted. Thanks for the analysis!,

My advice is to stay away from CCJ.Surely a strong rebound in uranium prices will lift all boats, incl. CCJ, but by far the highest quality uranium play out there is Nexgen.

"The prices are low because there is clearly more supply than demand, for now. This will change if Japanese reactors are restarted and all new nukes come online AND the supply does not grow. There is no certainty in any of them. The utilities are not in rush to pay higher spot prices because there is plenty of cheap supply. Think oil in early 2016. Heck, they even think that blatantly breaking contracts (TEPCO) is worth it! Either TEPCO knows that they will not need all that uranium (reactors will not restart) or they are certain that the cheap spot supply will continue indefinitely. I am sure they know more than we do about those things.For me, the long term holder of CCO with a significant position, there are only two positives in This story:1) Cameco is the largest supplier of uranium from a stable, super low risk jurisdiction. When it comes to long term contracts, who do you want to bet your house on? (See India deal) Cameco is not going away because it is a strategically important producer for Canada and in general. That is also why I believe that CRA will not cripple it with a huge fine - who bankrupts a strategically important national champion? 2) Tepco cannot win this ridiculous dispute. You cannot break a high-value, high-visibility international contract just because you feel like it. They are angling for a settlement and trying to negotiate down the amount while Cameco is weak and the prospect of reactor restarts is on the horizon. Cameco should NOT settle because they can and should win the whole amount. It is ridiculous. Yes, TEPCO might be pissed and not willing to give them another long term supply contract afterwards but who would want to sign one with such a crappy customerLong Cameco, but not enjoying the ride. I am not expecting uranium to recover to 70 but it will eventually recover modestly to the level where Cameco, Kazakhs, and Areva can supply with a breakeven cash flow. Hopefully. This stock has a 20-30% upside from this level on CRA and Tepco catalysts. More than that? Who knows",

"Held CCJ years ago. Good summary article. But... my takeaway is that CCJ is still a lousy investment. While CCJ stock price will fluctuate based on expectations of reduced supply, I do not believe the price of uranium will go up for several years, and thus any investment will be dead money for a long time. Time will tell, but I'm not a buyer now.",

Tim I always enjoy your balanced informative interjections into this sort of debate.What I can't get my head around is people on here condemning an airline for buying Airbus but seem to think Boeing have the right to sell huge numbers to Europe with carriers such as Ryanair and Norwegian ordering a hundred or more at a time.Personally I fly a lot of 737's and 320's and I much prefer the flight experience I get with the latter.,
"American Airlines!  Don't fly them either, Tim.",
So where is POTUS while DELTA is giving jobs overseas? Just how many lost jobs must there be before outrage in the WHS gets in Delta's ears? This does not make America Great.,
The A321neo is a replacement for Delta's aging 757 fleet. Delta didn't want to order any more 737's. The 321neo is a much better aircraft in terms of economy and passenger comfort.,
"Mat,I'm not Irish or Norwegian so I don't care what those countries use as a basis for aircraft purchase.  And, I really don't care if Spirit Wings sneaks a couple of Airbuses into their fleet.  But, when an iconic mega carrier like Delta takes a position as it has it rubs me the wrong way as it should you too, assuming your from this country.Yes, the world is a copious economy; but if my wife owned a fruit stand and I walked across the street to buy fruit from Ms Smith I would rightly be in the dog house (at best).Joe In Georgia",
"Personally I fly both 737's and A320;s and without doubt prefer the Airbus.Some of the jingoistic bull on here is unbelievable because, if European airlines such as Ryanair and Norwegian were forced to buy Airbus because it is European like some of you on here are suggesting US airlines should only buy Boeing, shows to me a very low level of understanding what the world wide economics is about.",
"thank you, JBPJDIt never ceases to amaze me how honest business related discussions about the airline industry are reduced on SA to blinded loyalty, name-calling, and flat-out inability to quote facts.  Dheirin does have a great ability to write articles that generate lots of commentary which puts money in his pocket  - which is great for him.  Delta and no other airline discussed in this article is actively taking delivery of NEW 737-900ERs and A321s.  In Delta's configuration, the A321 most certainly has wider seats in coach - 18 inches on the A321 to 17.2 on the 737-900ER.  The seat pitch in all classes is the same and the first class seat size is the same on both aircraft types.  Further, the A321 accommodates 12 more passengers than the 737-900ER.  http://bit.ly/2FqEy1ghttp://bit.ly/2qQvnDLBoeing developed the 737-MAX10 with additional seats over the 737-MAX9 and -900ER to compete with the A321 but that option was clearly not available when Delta placed its first order for the A321.The 737-MAX10 was available when Airbus won the latest Delta A321 order but again, Airbus won the order because they offer Pratt and Whitney GTF engines for which Delta won a $10 billion maintenance contract - to overhaul engines from throughout the Americas at Delta's facilities in the USA.  I'm not sure how else one could describe US built engines built on a US assembly line being overhauled by a US company in the US. Delta also win engine maintenance contracts from Rolls-Royce for engines that power the A350 and A330NEO. Further, the notion that Boeing is a US company and should be supported makes sense ONLY if anyone who uses that argument 1.  doesn't own stock in any foreign companies that compete with any US company for any product the two jointly produce and 2. that party has NEVER purchased a foreign built product or even a US built product made by a foreign manufacturer.  I will ask once again, as I have before, for the people that argue that DAL should buy only Boeing to tell me the content of their entire home contents and automobile.    I can absolutely assure you that the people who make such statements won't tell us the percentage of US content in their homes and that it came only from US manufacturers because Delta and every other US airline - including JetBlue which operates only Airbus and Embraer aircraft have more US content on their aircraft than any American consumer has in their home.  And EVERY US commercial airline flies aircraft that have engines or airframes that were either built outside of the US or assembled in the US by a foreign company,  There simply is no such thing as a totally US built commercial aircraft.  As hard as it is for some people to understand or admit, large industrial purchases including commercial aircraft are not made by US companies based on anything other than maximizing profitabililty.  and nothing else.Airbus happens to do a better job of delivering profit maximization for Delta right now - and also happens to deliver better comfort to Delta passengers compared with what they could get on Boeing's comparable aircraft.Hopefully Boeing will sharpen its product development, supplier partnership, and pricing pencils and they might win orders from Delta in the future.",

"From its merger with Northwest Airlines, the profile of Delta Air Lines purchases is unrecognizable. On 4 September 2013, Delta Air Lines will order from the French-German-Spanish Airbus aircraft manufacturer of 10 A330-300s and 30 A321s, then the June 2, the carrier of Atlanta will acquire 25 Airbus A350-900 and 25 A330-900neo to replace respectively, on the one hand its 747-400 and 767-300ER on international lines and and, on November 27, 2016, Delta Air Lines will cancel Nortwest Airlines' order for 18 Boeing 787-8 aircraft after having, in 2010, postponed its own order of 787-8 to cancel in 2011. In exchange for this cancellation, Delta Air Line will have to buy 100 737-900ER.Finally, on December 14, 2017, Delta Air Lines placed a firm order for 100 Airbus A321neoLR, together with the taking of 100 options .As of 16 December 2017, Delta Air Lines aligns 852 airliners including 197 Airbus (A319s, A320s, A321s, A330s, A350s), 484 Boeing (717s, 737s, 757s, 767s, 777s) and 171 McDonnell Douglas (MD-88s, MDs). 90).",

I have read the news paper quotes from Fabrice stating Air Bus's goal was to ""Kill Boeing"" (1985ish).The whole European plan is open to everyone who wants to look. Just because the shooter did it 30 years ago, the subsidy bullets continue to fly. Oh and DB, placing a final assembly line in Alabama, providing a American destination to simply assemble your European designed and manufactured parts, does not clear the slate as to calling Airbus an American company or even an American job creator. It is merely a cheap cover-up to impress bought off politicians.Boeing has done quite well considering they have had to compete with 35 plus years of sales corruption, kick backs and state subsidies from Airbus. Yes I am very proud of Boeing.

"While the Exim Bank and C Series issues have certainly muddied the BA-DAL relationship, the reason why DAL has ordered heavily from Airbus and little from Boeing has to do with product and Airbus' ability to facilitate deals between DAL and engine manufacturers that have tipped the economics of DAL's orders in Airbus' favor.- DAL cancelled the 787 order acquired from NW because the 787-8 was too small, the 787 was delayed significantly and early deliveries underperformed.  The 787-8 has not sold many copies regardless of the customer once the 787-9 became available.  It isn't clear what kind of pricing BA gave DAL for the 787-9 but DL stated that the NW 787-8 orders were priced very low.DAL's order for A350s and A330-900s was largely driven by DAL's calculations that the 787 was too costly and an overengineered solution for the Atlantic where DAL is the largest airline and where the 787's technology doesn't pay for itself.  As a derivative, the A330NEO costs less from a capital standpoint and will deliver comparable operating costs to the 787-9.DAL specifically said that it could have gone with either the 787 or A350 over the Pacific but Airbus made a package deal for the A330NEO and A350.DAL probably did order 737-900ERs as part of the exit plan from the 787 orders but the A321 is a more capable, slightly larger aircraft than the 737-900ER. DAL won the engine maintenance contract from Rolls-Royce for new generation widebody engines just as it did for the Pratt and Whitney geared turbofan engines on the A320 family, C series, and Embraer E2jets. While it might be fashionable to talk about the issues that have divided BA and DAL, the evidence overwhelmingly says that DAL has chosen Airbus aircraft for the last 3 big orders because of product and dealmaking, specifically around engine contracts.   Someday, Boeing might create world-class products AND be able to facilitate deals and place large numbers of aircraft at DAL in the future.In the meantime, DAL still operates the world's largest 757 and 767 fleets and will be among the top 10 global 737 operators for years to come.",

"PEG's in Oil Are almost Meaningless: Recall 5-7 years ago!I have Chevron in a long term trust since 1977. Exxon the largest component of the 28 component trust (Chevron is #2) is a security investment whereas Chevron has more upside potential during long duration Bull Markets for Oil. The trouble has become, which way is the Energy sector being pointed towards and which of the Super-Majors is best suited, through assets and business models to harvest the most potential CAGR in coming years.As Writer Stated ""CVX Has Lowest PEG""!This is absolutely true, but depending on a ""PEG"" <.5 where commodity prices and demand plays such a massive role makes 5 year projected CAGR in P/E rather meaningless. Recall the PEGs that were being solidly supported in 2012 and 2013? They were similar to today's yet in reality turned ""Negative"" with Chevron going multiple quarters with little or NO Earnings, after posting record Earnings 5-7 years ago.We  Live on Present & Future Dividends: Oil Isn't as Promising as it Was!For decades, both the share prices and dividends for Chevron and Exxon provided a ""Total Shareholder Return"", on an annualized basis, superior to the broader market and ~15+or- would be fair for Exxon and ~22% for Chevron, until 1998. That's conservative and based on actual returns made on investments since 1961. I had to combine Texaco with Chevron and Mobil with Exxon having bought all 4 for the trust. 1998 represents the last Trust purchases made for either company.Recent Outside of Trust Shares are NOT Performing as Well!Since 2014, I have been free to set-up DSPPs and Discretionary Diversification Funds. Naturally, though I intended to Diversify, in investments outside of our 'Energy Overweight' trust circumstances, it didn't happen that way. Both Exxon and Chevron took turns, since 2014, being our largest Discretionary Diversification Securities Account. First, it didn't work with Chevron, and we exited after 16-19 months with a 'Total Shareholder Return' of 2%. Admittedly, had I kept the position until this article was written, @~$128, I could have been ahead by about 18%, including dividends. However, today, a few weeks later, Chevron has fallen by $20, and I am now barely back to 5%, had I held for 3+ years, including the rebound in crude oil from $26 to over $70.  Currently, Brent is ~$62-64.Exxon Hasn't Done Much Better But I Managed To Sell Right!I started Exxon in the Discretionary Account and a DSPP in the 1st Qtr of 2017, but made the largest buys in both when Exxon was at or near multi-year lows. So my Discretionary accounts ""Cost Basis"" without dividends was ~$78.88 (according to our Accountant). I sold it entirely for ~$85 in the 3rd quarter to buy Next Era Energy, for ~$145. I gained ~6% on the sale, without 2 quarters of dividends. Today Exxon is trading for ~$10 per share less, and Next Era Energy has gone up ~$11 per share. Equally important, NEE raised their dividend from 98.75 Cents to $1.11 and issued a statement that the rate of increase ~13-14% was projected to continue at that rate for at least the Next 5 years. Meanwhile, Exxon a Dividend Champion with 43 years of consecutive increases hasn't announced an increase, but optimistically I expect an increase to 80 cents, to be announced within the next quarter.What Happened To The DSPP for Exxon?When Exxon's share price passed $81, after making several ""1 time buys"" at or under  $80, I stopped buying and let it DRIP for 1 Quarter, gaining a few shares at a little more than $80. When shares rose to ~$90 in January, I reckoned that Exxon buys were going to be DRIP only for a protracted period. However, when the price fell back toward 'Multi-Year Lows', I placed a fair size ""1-Time Electronic Buy"" via Transfer Agent, Wells Fargo, without any fees, and within several days it showed up for $74.68 per share. After I post this comment I plan to repeat the buy. At $75 there isn't as much downside for Exxon than there is for Chevron, even at $109! Why Isn't Chevron As Secure With As Large A Share Price Discount?1)- Crude Oil is trading at the highest prices for longer, since 2014!2)- Chevron relies more on Upstream Segment than Exxon which is more vulnerable to Crude Oil Price downturns.3)- A Saudi Aramco IPO is anticipated and has likely been the impetus behind the KSA's restraint in production.4)- Chevron is, as the author correctly pointed out, almost 5/8 in Oil versus ~56% for Exxon, and the KSA has mostly ""Associated Gas Reserves"" which is 'Sour' and needed for domestic Electric generation, currently being generated with Crude Oil. This past summer they wasted as much as 1.47 Million barrels daily where Natural Gas is better suited. This issue will intensify over time and prevent the KSA from ever becoming a leading Natural Gas exporter.5)- Even when crude oil traded for as little as $26, during the 1st quarter of 2016, Exxon showed overall Earnings on the strength of its International 'Chemical' and 'Downstream' segments. Chevron had a number of losing quarters. Until this past quarter Chevron relied on Asset sales, including its Geothermal Segment, and Offshore Gulf Drilling (both in 2017) to continue paying its dividend. Chevron also went the maximum number of quarters without raising its dividend, possible, without losing its Dividend Aristocrat status. Another typical downturn in the price of crude would leave Chevron without enough ""FCF"" to pay their generous dividend without additional asset sales and Debt.6)- Exxon has managed to maintain a AA+ Credit Rating and a relatively low debt level compared to Chevron. With rising interest rates, carrying more debt will be more expensive than in the recent past.h",
CVX stock price already reflects the improvement. I don't expect a big move with earnings announcement. We will get a clearer view of FCF with big LNG projects winding down.  The FCF per share is a bit high and dividend coverage is weak. So I don't expect much dividend growth.  Could see some one time bump with the deferred tax balance being revised to reflect lower tax rate,
"Chevron's 4th quarter will likely be a pleasant surprise and more than cover its dividends for the first time in 3 years. I would like to see Oil remain in the sustainable price range, $60-75 for average light/medium crude. Trouble is, whenever this has occurred since 2014, a severe and unforeseen downturn has followed. We've had Chevron shares since the 1970s, but it tends to react more to severe conditions than Exxon. It tends to rise more in bull markets and dip more during 🐻 markets making both Exxon and Chevron a nice pair to permanently hold as core holdings. That's what my dad has done. Though he is more enthusiastic about Chevron's upside potential, he has acquired significantly more Exxon shares. He says it takes away a large portion of the overall risk, having both rather than just one or the other. They are his #1 and #2 Trust holdings since the last century. Southern Company was #2, but its dip which coincided with Chevron's surge caused the switch in positions.",

"Thanks for your writeup.  While I appreciate your analysis of assets, earnings, operations, etc. by far the most important reason for the answer to your question in the title is found in the changing industry dynamics.  The US airline industry is basically an oligopoly with very limited foreign competition for intra-US flights.  Now that the CEO's of the remaining 4 major carriers have decided to optimize profitability, the industry should be run in a fairly sensible way which benefits the incumbent carriers (if not the passengers).   Yes, the ultra discount airlines will nip at the heels of the major carriers but they won't ever build networks the size of the majors.  This administration will not allow foreign carriers to seriously compete in domestic US travel so there is  no threat from foreign completion.  High speed trains and other alternative long distance transport alternatives are a long way off.  For the next decade or so, as long as management behaves sensibly, you are probably safe buying any of the major carriers.  That said, the history of the industry sends a warning that management can pursue irrational behaviors at any time.  And, critically, the airline industry treats its customers incredibly poorly.  That will lead it ripe for disruption if a new user friendly competitor arises.",What Does Buffett See In United Continental And The Airline Industry?
"jackc77, there is a reason it is called the 'defense' industry. True we could spread death and destruction starting with the 'boomers' in the subs (offensive weapons) but LM is heavily involved in defensive weapons and satellites for defense. Until world peace breaks out I'm afraid you are stuck with us. Given the current world we live in today I for one am not ready to believe that we should pretend a threat does not exist and that we should not be prepared for it. Costly yes but you may not have any rotting infrastructure to worry about if we turn a blind eye.I know you have probably heard that before but If you work in this industry you would probably be a little more concerned then you are. If you are morally opposed then don't buy LM or sell what you have. Otherwise I would recommend just the opposite.",
"Good idea to buy the stock of companies who sell to the US government. The government never runs out of money, pays any price , and loves to bend over , especially when juicy kickbacks are involved on all those defense contracts.

The rural store concept is not something AMZN or WMT could not copy with their access to capital though. For now it seems that they are not pursuing it.The same store sales growth is impressive for another reason.

I am not saying Ctrip will lose its market share, but the competition will still erode its margin ahead. In addtion, if we look at its R&D expenses, the amount is astonishing. It spent billions of dollar while priceline only spent a small fraction of it. I have no idea why it spent so much. Even technology-intensive Baidu only spent 50% more.

Excellent article!I am reading it after CELG has announced an agreement to acquire JUNO for $9 bil.The financial side of me sees CELG building up huge ongoing expenses with dozens of drug candidates in each focus area. Is that better than focusing on just a few best drug candidates or is it wasteful? Time will tell. Historically an absence of expense management doesnt end well. Yet I am unsure if that is truly what is occurring. Also the ends may justify the means in oncology.On the positive side CELG continues to capture the high ground in the war on Cancer. I must give them credit for a relentless persuit on cancer survival. I do believe in the quality of their research and their commitment to achieving success.As a long term investor in CELG I remain willing to buy additional shares under $100 and sell some shares for a reasonable profit. To keep a solid position at all times and ride the waves.,
"Another very well written article, thank you. Are you concerned with debt with acquisitions and possibly Juno. Saw maybe 400m to AGIO offering.",

DoctoRx - Solid view and thesis.  Enjoyed the read very much.Long term slow and steady investors (5 - 10 years) in CELG have been well rewarded.  More than willing to continue to hold my position and add to it each time CELG consolidates below $100.  Writing OTM covered calls anytime the stock touches $120 has worked well too.  I'll continue with this two prong approach until I see one of the collaborations or acquisitions start to deliver an acceleration in the company revenues and margins.Keep an eye on the AGIO and BLUE collaboration/relation...  Both should deliver a significant amount of long term value over the coming years.My two cents!  Slow and steady!  Good luck to you with your position!,
"Doctoro: Excellent article as usual. We miss you Johnny !  You as a trained MD Cardiologist should continue to focus on what you know best, Medicine-Biotechnology ! JMO . CELG is definitely not suffering from the GILD disease, nor is its “parent cliff “ in any way similar to GILD. They had 2 patent cliffs ,  2010-13, when HIV was their main drug with patent expiry until the acquisition of Pharmaset and record revenues. earnings and FCF, The recent patent cliff due to declining HepC sales was remediated by the KITE transaction . In both cases GILD had a very small product portfolio as opposed to CELG with a large number of products and great pipeline. To my way of thinking a very different story. CELG is suffering from the Fouseless Syndrome. Jackie as CFO always low balled guidance, and then beat consensus by large numbers. That and her direct connection to the Buy and Sell Side, created huge shareholder value. Alles and team took a different approach to guidance and made a huge error by overstating guidance, missing consensus and setting up a $45 loss in share price just in October. Your reference to Revlimid revenues until 2021, is an admission of my long held thesis that a settlement with Dr Reddy is in the cards. In conclusion the Receptos and JUNO deals will replace Revlimid revenues, and the pipeline is quite robust. I agree with you whole heartedly that CELG is very cheap by any metric. One last thought, I sense Peter Kellog may just be the person to reinsert the lost Fouse’ Factor. Jackie Fouse' always stated that CELLMod's are the future.",

"Very interesting analysis, DoctoRx. I agree with your overall optimism about the deal and Celgene's future. I think they'll identify some interesting possibilities to overcome the patent cliff, although no one can see the future clearly! In my recent piece on the matter, I figured this could be a huge driver for them, given the success of ruxolitinib. That has major caveats, of course, as you lay out here.Regarding the potential for a fedratinib competitor coming in and beating them up, this is a possibility, but I'm moved a bit by the observation that there are tons of JAK inhibitors being developed, it seems, and none has emerged as a bona fide competitor to ruxolitinib.

"Interesting concept (bitcoin mining with spare solar). I would be interested in the assumptions behind the numbers you have presented to understand better. eg is the ASP price of $100 the price of the BM1385 and whatever is needed to integrate it with the Enphase microinverter, or is that the price for enphase micro inverter with integrated BM1385? In your $23 / year, does that assume you are mining 24/7, or only when there is spare solar power?I am no expert in any of this, but have I suspect your returns might be overly optimistic at the numbers outlined??? I assume the $23/year return on the $100 BM1385 is if you run the BM1385 24x7, and I assume the assumption is the electricity is free?If my assumptions are correct, the following are some of my calculations and assumptions (happy to be corrected on the assumptions I have made and got wrong) :-1. at today's rate, electricity would need to be below 26.2c/kWh ($23 / 365 days / 24h / 0.010kW)  before it would be worth running the miner because if electricity is more, it will be costing you most in electricity than the miner could return in bitcoin. I assume any price of above zero for electricity would reduce your ROI.2. I assume your 4 year return on investment for the BM1385 is based on mining 24/7. If you are counting on cheap/free/spare electricity from solar, it is likely it is only going to be economic to run it limited number of hours a day. If it is targeted at only times when end user has excess electricity that would be exported, that might be closer to 4 hours a day than 24 hours a day. Which might only be $4 a year rather than $23. If this is the case, it is going to take a long time to payback.3. From my limited understanding, bitcoin mining is dependent on having the latest most efficient ASICs. Complexity of bitcoin mining goes up over time, and is driven by competition. So hardware that might be able to generate a return today, might not be worth running in a years time because costs of running is less than the return. Putting an ASIC in a micro inverters with a 25 year lifespan, that is likely to need upgrades in MUCH shorter timeframes than this to remain competitive seems like a bad plan. It might be better for Enphase to build an interface (software and hardware) that will allow other things to switch on and off based on spare solar (ie hot water heaters, AC units, car battery chargers......or dedicated bitcoin mining rigs, or battery banks etc etc), rather than trying to integrate application into the micro inverters that might be obsolete in a short period of time. As a case in point, while I am no expert in bitcoin mining, I believe the state of the art 2015 BM1385 is now obsoleted by more modern chips (eg BM1387 which is both more powerful, and power efficient).4. 10W of power is going to translate into 10W of heat. All that needs to be dissipated as heat is the enemy of all electronics in terms of efficiency and longevity. Sure enphase seem to be doing amazing things in this regard, and they do seem to have made a reliable and reasonably efficient device that needs to operate in hot environments. But I am not sure adding another 10W of heat to that equation is a good idea on a hot roof for either the existing inverter circuitry, or the BM138X chip and supporting circuitry. 5. Putting in hardware in Enphase inverters that is effectively betting on the ever increasing prices in bitcoin looks like a risky business approach for Enphase to use to take their business forward.Gees, I hope Enphase has a better business plan than betting on something like bitcoin or even blockchain. Bitcoin explores some very cool and interesting technological and monetary principles. But at the end of the day it has zero intrinsic value, and is not backed by anyone or anything that has any intrinsic value. Sure, ""if"" technology is free from security flaws, some would argue it inherently has limited supply which is important for something that is a store of currency (and there are some major ""ifs"" in that statement). That is .....except for the fact that anyone can start a competing crypto currency, so on that level they are not limited in supply at all. If any of these competing crypto currency has advantages that make it perceived as better all around than bitcoin, what do you think will happen to the bitcoin price? If the bitcoin price collapses, what do you think are the chances in the market having faith in a competing bitcoin crypto currency that is not backed by something or someone of intrinsic value??? I do not pretend to be expert in any of this, and might be missing something simple.To me, bitcoin looks like latest version of Tulip Mania, with elements of a Ponzi scheme at the prices it is current trading. As for using blockchain technology to allow peer to peer trading of power, I struggle to see how this adds value over competing approaches. Electricity can't traded over thin air or the internet, it needs polls and wires. For most of us the easiest way to trade power will be via the existing grid, or a grid built by a third party, both of which have a 3rd party which will enable far simpler and easier trading than any blockchain technology. So I struggle to see where blockchain adds value in this model.But my crystal ball is often wrong, so who knows what the future holds. And as always interested to hear from people smarter than me who can point out what i am missing.",

Article is nonsense. Hippies growing marijuana in 1970’s was catalyst for solar. Give me a break.,
"There is an economic fallacy in this article, this fallacy is aside from the fact that it's not true that the existing microinverter enclosures could support an additional fanless 10W of dissipation and that power line communication could reliably push mining problems to each microinverter every 10 minutes. But  let's say these things can be fixed with even more expense on the micros thereby further increasing $/W. The fallacy is that solar customers will only pay the same $/W as that of other solar equipment OEMs. One can't sell nameplate wattage, and keep a fraction of it for mining and expect to keep selling at the same price point. One would have to discount the customer's lost mining power from the equipment ASP. Therefore the 'free' power is lost to the OEM from the time of sale through the required discounted ASP.",

I can't say I understand blockchain and cryptocurrencies  but I have more understanding of them after reading your article.  However I do like the idea of value added.Long ENPH,
"TJ,There are a lot of people looking at combining Solar and Cryptomining.  Are you saying that Enphase is actively designing a micro inverter with Cryptomining built in?  or is this just an Idea that you are throwing out to see if people make a connection between anaphase and crypto mining and bite?I am long Enphase, but I am also long tesla and Solar Edge.  I would hate to combine technology that generates electricity with one that mines cryptocurrency.  The Cryptomining part of the design will go obsolete in a year or two as faster and faster cryptomining computers come out.  I don't want to pay any extra for a micro inverter that is supposed to last 25 years.  If it has to dissipate an additional 10 watts of power, it will be be less reliable on the hot roof than a similar one that converts that power and sends it into the electricity grid.Also, since crypto mining rigs give off heat, the waste heat can be used to heat water for domestic consumption or even for aquaponic green houses. http://bit.ly/2FkCTu1my 2 cents.",

"Hello Ted,Since the articles you wrote on S.A. are now mostly blocked, I thought I would use this thread to ask about DMG Blockchain.  You had recommended it and would like to have an update.

"SNN is well financed, has a pay or lose deal with Canopy for a bunch of their production, is leasing space in their huge facility to smaller pot growers, thus hedging their costs until demand meets what they intend to supply.   I believe one of their 2 monster facilities is completely funded and maybe the other one too, (maybe someone else can comment on that here).Price action is price action and may or may not mean anything to the long term investor. I don't see how lack of price action at this stage of their development is a concern.  Only wish I hadn't bought my full allocation months ago.  Should have known better but still, I""m not worried since this would need two meteors to crash into both large construction sites to go bad.

"Hello everyone, I found this article that should help calm those of you who are nervous about the recent dips (you shouldn't be). Here is the link to the original article https://tgam.ca/2uJLIMJ (keep in mind it is locked but i managed to copy it for you guys to read it without having to subscribe) Beacon Securities analyst Vahan Ajamian said Sunniva Inc. (SNN-CN) presents investors with rare exposure to two of the world’s largest cannabis markets – Canada and California. He initiated coverage of Vancouver-based producer with a “speculative buy” rating. “While there is no shortage of ‘we will grow weed and sell it’ stories out there, in our opinion, Sunniva clearly gains tremendous credibility and differentiates itself from the pack due to the following two main factors,” said Mr. Ajamian.“First, ‘they have literally done this before.’ Dr. Anthony Holler, Sunniva’s CEO, was previously the Founder and CEO of ID Biomedical. ID Biomedical built the world’s largest flu vaccine manufacturing facility, presold its production, and sold the company to GlaxoSmithKline for $1.7-billion in 2005. Second, in February 2018, Sunniva announced a definitive take or pay supply agreement with Canopy Growth Corp. (WEED-T), to supply it with 45,000 kilograms of production from its B.C. facility a year for an initial term of two years – by far the largest transaction in legal cannabis history.”Mr. Ajamian noted the pricing realized from the Canopy agreement will be governed by a revenue share, thus Sunniva’s take remains uncertain. However, he said he cannot envision a scenario where it would receive less than $3 per gram from sales.“This would thus generate a minimum of $135-million of sales for Sunniva in each of the two years,” he said. “A group of U.S. cannabis operators currently trade at an enterprise value-to-calendar 2019 estimated sales multiple of 2.0 times. Applying this multiple on the aforementioned $135-million of sales (even though these are entirely Canadian sales for Sunniva, and no U.S. operator has anywhere near such committed volumes – never mind to Canopy, which we consider to have extremely low credit risk) results in an implied EV of $270-million versus an EV of $266-million or all of Sunniva. Accordingly, we argue that investors are essentially paying for the value of Sunniva’s contract with Canopy and thus getting the other three businesses for free (i.e., California greenhouse, NHS and VC – plus whatever else the company can produce and sell from its B.C. greenhouse).”“While we anticipate that there will initially be shortages of low cost, high quality and pesticide free legal product, we believe the industry could eventually see a surplus,” the analyst said. “We believe Sunniva stands to benefit under such a scenario from its focus on low cost production at scale – as well as the diversification of the markets it serves (i.e., both Canada and California).Sunniva has been trading for less than three months – during a period largely marked by a pullback in the sector (average stock is down 33 per cent). Until today Sunniva had no analyst coverage and, fresh off its $28-million oversubscribed financing, we believe investors will quickly and increasingly take note of this name. We recommend investors acquire shares aggressively at current levels.”",

It's all in the latest (March 20) prospectus:Upon completion of the Offering, the Company intends to allocate and use the net proceeds in the following manner:• It is intended that approximately $15,000,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering will be used to fund deposits with construction vendors for the Sunniva Canada Campus.• It is intended that approximately $1,200,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering will be used to purchase equipment for the initiation of oils and extracts manufacturing at the APL Facility.• It is intended that approximately $1,000,000 of the net proceeds of the Offering will be used for the continued development of the SPARK enterprise platform to support continued NHS patient expansion.• It is intended that the remainder of the net proceeds of the Offering will be used by the Company for working capital purposes of a nature typical for a company engaged in the cultivation and sale of marijuana and related products.",
"Thanks Ted, for your feedback. Do you know what the bought deal money will be funding mostly? What is your take on that?",
"Ted, I as well as many others have never lost faith in you, nor will we. However there is a slight feeling of anxiety which I am not usually prone to have over the dramatic drop in Sunniva. Yes you mentioned that they have a pending deal which is about to be concluded and yes there would be a stall out period but, this is relatively dramatic as you cannot find one source that is not negative on this stock. Could it be they are not understanding the new model or perhaps the word California is scaring them. Some reason regardless of how emotion based or funtionally not viable or whatever? Any pearls of wisdom, life preserver or just a plain kick in the ass!!!!!",

"It's funny, Ted, we all have different thought patterns. Remember when you where trying to help me understand. ""Take some off the table"" and explained it several different ways till I got it as to how it ""worked for me"". The thing I enjoy about cannabis investing. NOBODY IS AN EXPERT!!! New investors as well as long term investors are pretty much on the same page. I see more new investors seeking your advice but am glad ""the old boys"" are looking for answers too. In a way, us newbies might be better off, we take direction well and may not understand a lot of the terminology but also don't have cast in stone mindsets. Thanks.",
"That does help and again, thanks so much.m",
"Hi Ted,Maybe you misunderstood my comments about Alcalibar. I too have lots of confidence in Canopy (but not Aurora) and was only using that potential acquisition to compare it to Aurora's purchase of CanMed.  I'm expecting the CanMed acquisition will not be accretive.  It looks like you believe should Canopy acquire Alcalibar that deal would be accretive, (though no one knows until the deed is done).But I have a general question that I believe you can answer for me.  When a CEO makes the decision to acquire another company and begins to look for ways to finance that purchase, he must calculate what his cost of equity is as well as the cost of debt.   Isn't equity always cheaper than debt and if that's so, what stops a company from overpaying via share dilution? I'm having trouble understanding what is too much dilution in an industry where dilution is almost necessary to keep up, since too much debt would ruin the company's credit but too much dilution....?  At this point it appears that too much dilution goes unpunished in the pricing of shares, at least in this industry, whereas too much debt would be a big red flag.  Is that fair to say?Can you shed more light?Always appreciative of your efforts,m",
"By that standard, should Canopy win the Alcalibar bidding contest, I hope it's accretive. At least Alcalibar is a going business in a mature industry and a market leader so I assume it would have a better chance at being accretive than Aurora's purchase.  Much to gain for Canopy.",
"Thanks Ted and I guess, right or wrong, that's just what prompted me to sell Aurora and keep Canopy.Interesting times.",
"Hi all,Anyone care to educate me on how to deal with the dilution aspect of investing in a rapidly growing arena like MJ?  I understand companies want to use their lowest cost of capital to acquire others, but at what point does dilution become over bearing?  Any guidelines?  I  just sold out my Aurora stock due to this issue. Canopy has probably a similar issue/valuation but I fear that Aurora is too aggressive at this stage and if I'm wrong, I can always buy back in.So how do you professionals deal with dilution?  When it is too much? When does it cross the line (I assume there is one) that would make it a bad stock to invest in and that in an environment such as this, where normal valuations are out the window?Thanks in advance,m",
80% on sunniva,
10 times more shares of dmggf traded than snnvf yesterday,
"For those who have invested in Sunniva. I believe there is an article on SA (my apology if Im mistaken as I browse thru few other discussion boards and might have seen it somewhere else) with the calculations of the potential price of Sunniva's shares in the near future. I might be off a bit with the precise dollar values but here it goes...The normal/conservative scenario calculations were claiming a share would be around 30$ late 2018, going to $100+ in 2019/2020. So back to investors vs traders. As someone already mentioned the times of easy money are gone. Now, the patience, and me personally, beleiving that we all would be rewarded. Just not as soon as some of us are wishing. PS, dont remember the currency of the above calculations as I would be happy either way :)",
"Ted,as you have been a mentor to many of us who have never really invested, ONE thing stands out clearly. Everyone has a different perspective.  I envy the traders that have done this in the old days and have made a killing. I wish I had been there. I started about a year ago as I was flat on my back for over a month. Found pot to be a real money making opportunity and and took some money and began to play. It sounds easier than it was but until our little downturn was 3 times my initial investment.  As i did not need this to secure my retirement other then SHOP. Canada  and Sunniva  cannabis have been my game. I do not plan to stay in long so 2-3 years is my outlook. At such time it becomes a commodity, I may hold some stable positions. Bottom line is thats why they have so many flavors of ice cream atBaskin Robbins.....",
"Ted - thanks for your hard work !!!!I was 50% POT during the run up and took profits. I am now 12% with a 20K paper loss in SNNVF as I bought way before this latest ""bought deal"".33% cash50% dividends (Senior retired)12% pot5% gold/silverWill increase marijuana as we get closer to July.",
"In other words, sell the news. A bit of disappointment on Sunniva but it’s only been a month. Always do your own DD as it comes back and haunt you. Too many variables that are still unknown. High risk. High reward. High downfall. Wait and see. If you wait long enough, turbulent waters become more clear.",
"Understanding that allocation is the first line of defense in risk management, does anyone want to throw out what percentage of a fine, growth portfolio should be invested in this company as well as in the MJ sector?  I'll kick off the discussion with my allocation:  For the MJ Sector as % of total portfolio:      10%  (this was 20% but I have been culling profits since my entry in November, total portfolio has gone up, etc...)For SNNVF as % of total sector investment:    19.2%  (Pretty much this is what I put into it as it hasn't moved since I bought it)As a % of total portfolio:1.9%I think any discussion about price and when to buy should be tied to an allocation discussion, in order to keep an appropriate focus on risk.  Having said that, I'm 76 and since I don't own any bonds, am 100% equities in my portfolio (plus I have a very large options component in that same portofolio), allocation is much more important to me than to younger investors. Just thought I'd open up the subject for conversation since many times, risk management gets pushed to the back in the heat of the exciting growth/potential story.mykie",

"Vanguard charged me for DOJA, Sunniva, Canopy.  I called them three times complaining.  They don’t care.  I transferred all of my stocks to Ameritrade because I made phone calls and asked for the international trading desk to find out if they charge 50 bucks.  Ameritrade doesn’t.  I got 500 free trades and 100 bucks for depositing more than 25 grand.  I also transferred my Roth, got 200 bucks, the next level,  which also came with 500 free trades for 60 days because I plan on buying any future stocks from my Roth, which is tax free.  I did a lot of inquiring to figure this out.  Once my 60 day free trades expire, I’m going to use Ameritrade trading platform and purchase any new stocks on Robin Hood, free trades on the major exchanges, but don’t use Robin Hood for pot stocks because you can’t, from my research.",
"Hey Mykie,I wrote Fidelity about this. Please consider writing them. if we continue to write them they should change... they know exactly what they're doing...",
"Hey Umpire,If I were you I'd call Fidelity and tell them they are NOW  out of sync with the rest of the industry and they should drop their punishing fee to what the competition is doing.  I've read that the above are trading it for $4.95 to free.  I jumped in early, paid the $50 but intend to beat up on Fidelity when I'm ready to sell, if they still hold out for $50.",
"even though sunniva trades on a different exchange now fidelity adds a $50 settlement fee to buy, i am guessing also to sell, can people use some other trading company and not have to pay the settlement fee",
"Yes, great news and timely.  I've wondered why SNNVF doesn't get more press, considering the amount of money and expansion plans they have, spanning two countries.  Maybe this will put them on more radar screens.  How does this fit in with SNN's latest strategy to rent spots to other growers?  Will some of these product sales to Canopy have to be shared with the independent growers that are renting space from SNN and if so, is that considered in their calculation of future profit margins?I'd also be interested in hearing how SNN has structured the contracts with these independent growers.  I am expecting an oversupply at some point (that could be a wrong assumption) and if so, would the independent growers renting space from SNN become competitors and/or become a limiting factor on the high profit margin of product SNN is able to grow themselves?  In this instance, the contracts that are signed by the independent growers/SNN loom up to be important in duration, obligation, etc.",

Cool video for those who have not seen it.http://bit.ly/2BBp8rq,
@User 16760062I would say a high tech green house... based on the dutch model....would definitely give them a competitive advantage. The demand for tomatoes isn't the same as Cannabis. NHS could be crucial to locking in pre-sell contracts due to insurance companies finally getting on board and covering medical marijuana products for patients.,
Also the NHS question is valid.  I think at some point the government will have to distinguish between medical and recreational marijuana via THC %.  The requirement should not change for medical,
Great questions Oak all of them.  In my opinion the market is too saturated to build a high tech greenhouse.  They don’t mass produce tomatoes in a high tech greenhouse.  The whole idea is questionable at best.  The pesticide free is important.  I would compare it to tobacco more or less and they do t have high tech greenhouses for tobacco but I may be wrong.,

Sold all my pot stocks at the end of last year. Bought SNN at the beginning of the year. Now back to where I started with that one.

"Ted, just throwing bread on the water.. This weeks meltdown ? It is across the board, WHY.1. US higher than usual political confusion would have a small influence.2. Profit taking? Pretty big decline for that ?3. Large investments shifting positions. Why is that not showing up in any particular stock?Now theory or strategy time. Everyone is aware that an extended hold up in the legalization timeline would have some real effect. How real?Next, many people buying a company hoping for a buyout. This area I think is shrinking?Next, The only the big will survive and flourish mentality seems a little dramatic but it definitely holds true for the flourish part as global connections are going to be the key in long term performance once the music stops and it's time to grab a chair...It's hard to see that new Porsche or Condo go down the tubes in last weeks drop , not to mention the abuse from friends that are blue chip only but any of us that have been on this daily for at least a year realize this is part of the game.

Existing MJ in Calif is contaminated by pesticides. Almost 80% of it. Sunniva will produce pesticide free MJ at high quality, low cost7.

Calif population is more adaptive to MJ than any other state in the US (my guess is much more than Canada). It's just the culture of Calif (hippie/liberal/Hollyw... women)14. Proximity to Nevada (most in Nevada can drive over to buy better quality MJ and more variety of edibles)15.

"Hello Ted,In your newsletter sent yesterday, you mentioned that Emerald Health is a good stock to own when raising cash in your portfolio but not to purchase it at these levels.I'm not fully understanding what you meant by that comment.You have also mentioned that they have ""got ahead of themselves"" in terms of the recent rally of their stock.You also mentioned that Namaste is not worth purchasing at these levels, I own a lot of those shares, do you suggest ""lightining the load"" at this point or should I wait until the approval for their license is granted and sell on that news?I own Emerald and purchased it at $1.44, are you suggesting I sell at this point and buy back when it corrects?  I do have the freedom to check my stocks throughout the day but don't like to trade, for fear of selling too early (again as you mentioned in your newsletter).  I don't have a large position (about 1500 shares).  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.Thanks as always for your wonderful insight! :)",

"Hello, Ted's assistant here again. I have done some research into the share structure and I present to you some pleasant surprises:It has been commonly thought that the float is 17 million shares, however, here are more accurate numbers.Total shares outstanding = 26,636,070  (not fully diluted number)Shares in escrow = 8,940,395Of these, 10% were released from escrow on 1/10/2018, the date of the listing on CSESo shares currently in escrow = 8,046,356So the float as of today = 18,589,714But if you take the shares owned by the two principal officers, namely CEO Tony Holler and COO Leith Pedersen:Tony Holler - 2,882,612 (10.86% of shares outstanding)Leith Pedersen - 4,678,251 (17.63% of shares outstanding)So both these guys own a combined 28.49% of the shares outstanding.I don't think these two guys are dumping any shares now or in the next 6 months - just an assumption.So the ""realistic"" float is18,589,714 - 7,560,863 = 11,028,851I view the realistic float NOW as just a tad over 11 million sharesPS: No wonder shares are hard to buy. I wonder how the sp reacts when the company gets out in front of more eyes.",
"Ted, I just wanted to confirm that you still consider Sunniva to be a long term hold given the current increase in stock price.  It is very tempting to take some profits at this point.",
"Over the past month, Abcann stock has shot up from $1.30 to $3.14 on increasing volume. Seems like someone is accumulating a lot of their shares and there has been no news to drive this stock. I would not be surprised to hear that Abcann is being acquired in the near future by a bigger player.",
"Gentlemen, my sincere gratitude. I have never invested as I made my money in land development and sometimes dealing was not always polite. I guess my slipped showed and glad to see I am the company of GENTLEMEN..",
"Well I am glad to see some of you boys are extremely weathered and knowledgeable. It is somewhat like ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"". After following all of Ted's posts I have found a majority of the reply's thank him for his ADVICE. Now if complementing him on his guidance, which was meant as a true honor is mistaken as ""holding him totally accountable, then I believe your scope to be narrow. No person offering FREE advice is liable for your actions. The responsibility issue come into play from the standpoint of all the research he has to do to make his ""ASSUMPTIONS"". This is true for any contributor. Now as far as ""old friend"" . Mannerisms differ from area to area. Southern hospitality is a cultural thing. Any offense I am sure would have been addressed by Ted privately. I thought these posts were an informal informative vehicle , not a critique of personality traits. This may not be posted as it may be deemed offensive or CRITICAL but I feel it is important to keep any forum on track.",
"Ted, now that you have been able to digest the Aurora and CanniMed deal, what are your thoughts on buying or selling either of these?  I am thinking that Aurora is way overpaying for this but is obviously moving forward for strategic reasons.  However, perhaps the Aurora stock price may go down for overpaying.CanniMed shares seem to be undervalued right now for this deal, so maybe they are now a buy?Also, who do you think may be the next acquisition targets to make money on?  CanniMed shareholders almost tripled their money from November with this acquisition.Thank you greatly for all of your valuable work!",
Lexaria will probably pop on news,
"Hey Ted,Thanks for your great insight.Were you able to find out about Nanosphere?",
"I feel like Ted's assistant here :-)For those concerned about share dilution, rest easy because Sunniva will be doing debt financing for construction of their Canadian facility. For the California facility,  Ted already pointed out that Baker Pacific Group is building it at their own expense and Sunniva will be leasing it from Baker Pacific Group.So, no share dilution as far as construction costs go.Listen to CEO Tony Holler from the 1:50 mark below:http://tinyurl.com/y79...",

"Hi All,For me this stock is a hold until either Sessions clearly has the ruling hand over congress and  the President and overrules all the present activity in government at state and federal level to lighten up.  I don't think that 's going to happen and actually think the opposite will happen, so I'm in this stock until something changes with the original premise,  (which has been related to us by Ted), something changes in their mission or the environment they operate in (Canada and USA legistlative arenas) or all of a sudden USA states and foreign countries stop making efforts to change their laws to accomodate the product.Let the market dictate the next move, not daily price movements.That's my story and I'm sticking to it.m",
the thing is... another thorough analysis at research pool is pricing them at fair value at 47$ / share. They could still be potentially undervalued but there are so many variables involved...one thing is for sure... the California positioning is ideal.. for this industry,
"all i can say is obviously Dun MyDD seems very bullish on this stock with his comments thus far. I had over 10000 shares of SNN at one point and sold on the way up. I am looking for a reentry point but considering some of my other top holdings were down i took some of the Sunniva money and reallocated it those stocks at a cheaper price. (abattis, namaste, lexaria and future farm) I agree with Ted on his comments above not to chase. Primarily because he knows way more than me and secondly because no matter how good a company is they will never fly higher and higher forever. At one point SNN will drop a bit and that will be my entry point. There is so much nonsense around the marijuana and cryptocurrency space these days that it is hard to look through it and find people you can trust. Ted has singlehandedly proven himself as non biased and has helped me and so many other people recognize the reality of the industry through his experience and honesty. cheers and GLTA",
"With the share price going up like this, SNN market cap will soon break $500M (Currently sitting at $438M - data from tmx). So it could be excluded from the new Horizon ETF that's coming out in Mid Feb.",

"Ted,Just a thought - since Sunniva says it's working on deals, it just occurred to me that Tony Holler, CEO owns a winery in Canada and is said to be a big wine lover.It would not surprise me if Sunniva strikes a cannabis based deal with a California brewer.Just trying to connect the dots. What do you think?",

"SNNVF is experiencing it's highest daily volume so far, and we are not even at mid-day yet... This is going to run as word gets out - and I am sure it will be put on everyone's radar by EOD today.On a side note, does anyone have any thoughts or insight on Maricann Group?",
Ted Is there any concern that both the facilities will be late to the game in Canada and California.  Won’t that make it hard to catch up to all the other LPs.  I think there is a lot of risk of such a late start.,
Dang!! I dont think even the most optimistic buyer of snn expected this so fast!! Thank you Tom for all your hard work. You are officially on my Chridtmas list.,
"Hi Ted, why is Sunniva going crazy up the past 3 days??  BTW, thanks, we followed your advice!!",
"Everyone: If you are looking to buy SNNVF (on the US side), it is trading on the OTC. Since it is still not the grey market, you cannot see the bid/ask. But you can see the last trade price. But remember, that since the float is only around 17 million shares and the demand seems to be really high, you will have to play it by your own risk tolerance. Buying shares will not be cheap.I don't think even Ted expected the share price to be this high this soon.Personally, and this is just my opinion, the share price will be high but what you have to consider is the market cap is still peanuts compared to the other MJ players (Canopy, Aphria, Aurora etc.). So yes, psychologically it seems like it is a high priced stock, looking at the share price now, but when you look at the market cap, it is still cheap, in my own opinion.I also believe that Sunniva's real potential is in the California market. They are already building the Cathedral City facility (you can see the progress on their live webcam on their website) and they will start selling in California in 3rd Q this year. That is only 6 months away.Here is something else to keep in mind. Insiders own about 9 million shares but these are in escrow, meaning management cannot see them for 3 years. So that means a very limited share supply.No wonder the share price moves on low volume.The other thing is that in their news release from January 3, 2018, they talk about ""finalizing wholesale supply agreements"". The word ""finalizing"" to me, means they must have some on going discussions that have reached late stages. So this is huge news. Here are the actual words from that news release ""finalizing wholesale supply agreements related to the production capacity from each of those facilities"". Each facility meaning Canada and California facilities.None of what I am saying is investment advice, so please take my words as just my opinion.",
"Ted, after the new news about aurora paying 1.1B for cannimed which one do you suggest buying?  If you could get under the cap of 43 assuming Canadian dollars for cannimed would that be the way to go.  Thanks",

If I wanted to invest in about the 10 best companies that are active in the US, who should I invest in?Are there four or five top ones and then the best of the high potential smaller ones?For example, my current investments are about 70% in the five large Canadian companies (Canopy, Aphria, Aurora, MedRelief and Cronos), about 10% in Sunniva based on Ted and US involvement, and the remaining 20% divided between stocks that I see may have high growth potential (Cann Wheaton, Emblem, Phivida, GrowLife, Evio, Lexaria and Namaste, I would like to put together about the same list for the US.Any help anyone can give or sources for this information would be greatly appreciated.Thank you.",
Thanks for all your research/insight. Thoughts on Nuuvera?,
"How confident are you that Sunniva will receive some increased attention in the future, and why do you think people will trust Sunniva's future growth and execution over the more proven and solid top choices (IE Aphria, ACB, WEED).

Ted and Bloggers!Was looking for the latest report on Lexaria. Don't see it posted any where here. What was news  and/or where can we go to view it?.....WFIM,
"It looks to me like the market underestimated the volatility from a US administration hell bent on putting the brakes on legal cannabis transactions. or at least putting as many roadblocks in front of them for as long as they can. I know i underestimated this to some degree as well. It's clear with Sunniva's lack of traction this week that buyers just don't like what they see south of the border. at all.the question for me, as an aggressive cannabis investor is this: are global opportunities such that companies can overcome US uncertainty to still carve out huge growth?can the world leader in consumption essentially be left out of the equation, and we still see massive gains for companies like namaste technologies, Radient technologies, and Sunniva?I for one am looking forward the US elections later this year to provide us a shot in the arm in terms of a new guard stepping to educe the current administrations power over the industry. If you hold cannabis stocks, its clear to me now, no matter which side of the border you are on, Sessions has to be viewed as a threat to profits period. he planted a pretty massive roadblock in our way here.The good news is that this takes the air out of the bubble, and in a pretty controlled fashion. without so much hype, at least our gains are on slightly more stable ground. as an aside, DOJA is looking very strong right now. as a retail cultural shopping play, they can grow on both sides of the border with more impunity, selling the lifestyle, without selling the actual product. That is a very compelling investment indeed.",

The volume at which this trades is so low that in case of negative news, it would be extremely difficult to exit - you will be stuck for a while trying to have the trade go thru and the stock could plummet before it gets filled on the sell side4.

"Good Day Ted; Read and as usual really enjoyed your newsletter. As usual your time lines for correction I believe to be correct. I do have a question. ACBFF was one of my original and profitable positions, HOWEVER I am beginning to get this feeling that all is not right in Candy Land. I have decided to trim the vines but not aggressively with the exception of possibly dumping all of my ACBFF for greener pastures. SNNVF being one of them. I have weighted all the arguments of the bigger will survive and I realize we have no idea what legislation and beyond will bring but if I did cut, I have decided it would be ACBFF , not because of the merger as I think that will take place. Looking at your time line on the meeting at ACBFF I see a vote coming up on the 23rd of January. Assuming no great loss will occur or at least at the rate it is  going should I wait until after the meeting.? Can't check stocks today so have to wait till .Tuesday anyway. Any thoughts. Thanks,",
"Ted, thank you for all the great work.  Not only does your work shine above the rest, but I also measure a person’s work by the quality of followers that they have.  I think that the quality of followers that you have here is also above all the rest.  Congratulations.You say that if the CSA aligns with the TSE listing policy that the potential impact on cannabis stocks could be far reaching.  What specifically would happen to hurt our investments?  Wouldn’t the CSA allow an orderly removal of the listing.  Those that can meet the US ridiculous requirements could list on a US exchange.  There is great incentive for a cannabis company to spend the money to list on a US exchange.  Otherwise, is there still a Canadian listing that they could do?  Certainly if these companies would be devastated the CSA would take that into account, right?  Also, I would think that the CSA would not want to lose their listings.In Alan Brochstein’s list he includes Phivida.  My understanding is that Phivida uses CBD from legal hemp farms in the US and would therefore not be impacted by the CSE’s ruling.  Stupidly, my understanding is that CBD from US-approved hemp is legal to transport across state lines and sell anywhere in the US but MJ-based CBD is not.  One of the top knee surgeons in the US recommended CBD for me and I was surprised that it was readily available since it was derived from hemp.",
"Fantastic work as always Ted! Another detailed and well-researched article on a rising cannabis player.My main question that I was hoping that you would address is: How is Sunniva allowed to be listed on the Canadian Exchange when it has operations in the US? How is Sunniva permitted to sell in California, which is federally illegal, while Aphria was not permitted to conduct similar operations in Florida? The only difference that I can detect is that Sunniva is listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange while Aphria is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which was the main party opposed to listed companies operating in the US. If this is in fact the case, then it seems to me that Sunniva is highly exposed to the same backlash that Aphria experienced. Or perhaps the difference is structurally, which then begs the question as to why Aphria did not structure itself to be able to have operations in both the US and Canada.As always, I appreciate your great insight. And I apologize if you already answered this question in the comments above and I missed it",

"Hi Ted, Today I visited the Lift Cannabis Expo in Vancouver https://liftexpo.ca and I was blown away! If this is an indicator, I think people who cap the demand are not seeing this!Here are some indicators:1. While the younger group was clearly the predominant one, there were people who must have been in their 70's as well. 2, The ethnic make up was fascinating as well - no bars.3. The phenomenon has spawned so many ancillary businesses it will impact positively from growing to control systems, packaging etc. 4. One of the most fascinating booths was one where you could grow your 4 plants at home. It was a grow op in a box. For $999 Cdn, you get a box, the lights, the temperature controls and the exhaust fan along with an enclosed tent like structure. The recreation pot law allows individuals to grow up to four plants for their own consumption. The team will also guide you getting plants, soil etc. Four plants mature in 3 months. Value $2,000 Cdn. This I believe will be a big hit in smaller communities and rural areas.  Conclusion: I believe the market will explode. Canada will benefit over US because of the growth of allied industries.",

"Hi Ted, What do you think of the following? Thanks.However, with Sessions' latest move, Louisiana is uncertain about the future of its program. The governor's letter asked President Trump to protect state's rights by renewing the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, which prevents the Department of Justice from using federal funds to prosecute legal cannabis users and business owners. It expires in less than two weeks if not renewed, on January 19th.The governor notes that an effort is underway at the Department of Justice to eliminate the amendment.""If this were to take place, it would be devastating to so many men, women and children who are anxiously awaiting access to this treatment option,"" Governor Edwards wrote.If the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment expires, Sessions could have the power and resources to federally prosecute cannabis business owners and consumers operating under state law. It's up to Congress to renew the amendment as part of their 2018 omnibus spending package, or take things even further by ending cannabis prohibition once and for all.",

Ugh.I'm trying to limit my stocks to the main companies mentioned here, but I have others I've bought and want your advice Ted, or others, as far as what to jettison and put elsewhere. In SNN for example. I got a good position yesterday after opening a Fidelity account and am looking forward to the future with that company. Thank you Ted!Here are some stocks I could sell if advisable. Recommendations are appreciated as to keep or dump. Notis, Bayport, Fusion, MJNA, CBIS, CANN, CNNRF, MCOA, BUDZ, GLDFF, CRWG. Not a ton of money in there but I think it would be well spent elsewhere. I keep buying on the dips and always see by the end of the day I could have bought it lower. That's life.  Though I got into this just 3 weeks ago, I've broke even and look forward to positive things ahead.I still remember the college days when pot was 15-20/oz, though 1/5th the potency.

"Ok Ted, back to the ""gambling game"" guess it's in my blood.  Surely I have not lost any money on ACBFF, APHQF, EMERALD, EMBLEM, or CANOPY, which are my main plays. However SUNNIA is darn interesting. Put in a small play yesterday and realize Canada cannabis stocks in a correction mode BUT.... If it were you, would you be willing to trade your shares of ACBFF or APHQF for equal shares of SNNVF? I am going to guess this is a tough call and your safe answer is trade half??  I am not holding your feet to the fire just want your TRUE GUT feeling..",
"Blood on the street, profit taking, I love it, good chance to buy more. Have covered all my costs, now I can sit back and relax. What a ride!",

"Ted, do you have any insight on maricann? They seem to be the few who are profitable, with eps of .08 last quarters. Revenue went down but they were also holding back inventory to prepare for retail deals with local pharmacies and also for shipment of dry bud to Germany. Looks like Germany is a green light now and market cap seems small still. They do not currently have a lot of grow space but it looks like a good amount is coming online in 2018 like everyone else. I just can’t tell how many Canadian companies are shipping to Germany or how big the Germany market is.",
"They are considering SNN to be in the junior ETF! “While we are still at the preliminary prospectus stage, should it go forward as planned, share prices and liquidity of U.S. operators could be disproportionately impacted by the new buying power of an ETF. Examples of such stocks include CannaRoyalty (CSE:CRZ), iAnthus Capital Holdings (CSE:IAN), MPX Bioceutical (CSE:MPX), Marapharm Ventures (CSE:MDM), Friday Night (CSE:TGIF) and Sunniva (CSE:SNN). Smaller purely Canadian operators such as Delta 9 Cannabis (TSXV:NINE) could also benefit from the increased attention/liquidity. For reference, the top five holdings in HMMJ represent 59% of its assets – and its sixth and seventh largest holdings are not marijuana growers or retailers.”",
Thanks Ted. I am long term on your recommendations.,
I purchased SNN.CN for the long term. I have a feeling cannabis is going to be an election issue in 3 years time. I'm getting in early.,
"Ted. Your buy limit is 10. Is that, 10 CAD and $8 USD, correct. Not 10 USD",
Schwab is 40 day wait. Fidelity fee $50. E*TRADE fee $5. US OTC. Ted- my concern. The top 4 companies cumm market cap is about $20B. Add all other LPs and company mkt cap is nuts. I get momentum plays. However 2019 Canadian market value is $4B. I see a huge correction a reasonable event. I am cashing 30% out and then buy back in after correction. Reality check- At $30/share canopy is about $6B on its own. We need some upside. At $60 that would be $12B. Need a market that size before 2025. That said. I like what you wrote about SNNVF. a limited # if o/s shares. Upside here and organigram. But most of the rest have unsupportable caps. For me- Buying snnvf but taking profit on most others. Ted- I agree with others. Thank you for all the great advise. I invest in your recommendations. And thank you. But what is your feeling on correction in near term.,

"Hi Ted, what are your thoughts on IMLFF? The stock has seen a run up in recent weeks up to a high of $1.90 USD... but has seemingly come crashing and burning back down to the $1 range.  Do you think this is due to just the normal pullback following a big jump combined with pullback that's happening in the entire sector this week? Or is there something more/less. Thanks, Jeff",

"Love your articles!.In my investment portofolio i have a junior licensed producer, that shares an almost similar buisness model. they are based in Ontario, and looking at Sunniva, with their NHS clinics and them eventually wanting to expand to Ontario, I cant resist the feeling that this pickering producer might get a knock on their door in the forseable future. That junior LP is named Canada House Wellness CHV and consist of three companies. Abba medix, Knalysis technologies and Marijuana for Trauma clinics. there clinics is expected to hit 8k patients by year end. Although it isnt much to compare with Sunniva's patients. Just my personal opinion, I couldnt resist to mention it and see, if time permit, what your thoughts would be on this correlation.",
"Ted,What happens when a couple of Session's guys shut down firms in the US?  I think the reaction of cannabis investors will be a panic, and the cannabis stocks could take a real hit.  It's one thing to say we are eliminating the memo (a slight downturn) and another when businesses are shut down (panic).  I own SNN, but wonder if they could be targeted because they will be the biggest grower in the US with a brand new facility.  I think it is a time for caution.",

"Ted, This is an excellent overview of the company and you have presented the growth avenues very well.  What kind of valuation would be reasonable for the company given the aforementioned assumptions?  You say <10 $ is great value - where could it go and how does that compare to peers?",
Also a bonus question for Ted (or anyone else who's already done the calculation): what is the (back-of-the-envelope) price to sales ratio?  I'm having trouble finding financial information on the company since it's only just been listed.,
"Ted, you say that they have an early movers advantage in California and a chance to really establish themselves there, which would be fantastic given the size of the market.  I just have one question regarding that however - isn't recreational use already legal there, and so from where are people buying their legal cannabis?  Are there no really established players there, or is it just a hodgepodge of small companies at the moment?",

"Fidelity was very helpful this morning when I called FYI. It took a while to figure it out premarket but they were on top of it.  They did caution me about the rise of cannabis stocks over the last month for those of you that care.  Great timing by SA on the article release and even better work by you Ted to get it in for review in time. Like others have said, Ted is the only MJ voice I would have followed on a wild goose chase like that at 6 AM.  Now lets hope Trump dumps Sessions and we might actually make some money!",
"Thank you, Ted, for your industry and for keeping us informed.I managed to open a Fidelity account online. It took about a half hour, and their computer says it will take until Jan. 18 for funding to show up via transfer from a U.S. account. That's better than 40 days and the week's trading should give a good perspective.I have not yet found the Fidelity site symbol for Sunniva, but in searching for it I found a report of how a small Canadian exchange has  demanded within days information from Canadian companies with business connections to the U.S. The report gives a nice list of such Canadian companies, which I copy below:""The exchange has contacted 17 cannabis companies with U.S. exposure whose shares it lists, asking for public statements on how the policy announced by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions could impact their businesses, Carleton said.Those companies include CannaRoyalty Corp ( CNNRF ) and Liberty Health Sciences Inc ( LHSIF )The others are: Alternate Health Corp ( AHGIF ), MPX Bioceutical Corp ( MPXEF ), Nutritional High International Inc ( SPLIF ), Golden Leaf Holdings Ltd ( GLDFF ), iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc ( ITHUF ), Marapharm Ventures Inc ( MRPHF ), Friday Night Inc ( TGIFF ), Vodis Pharmaceuticals Inc ( VDQSF ), International Cannabrands Inc, CannTrust Holdings Inc ( CNTTF ), NanoSphere Health Sciences Inc ( RMZFF ), Body and Mind Inc ( BMMJ ) , High Hampton Holdings Corp ( HHPHF ), Wildflower Marijuana Inc ( WLDFF ), and Tinley Beverage Company Inc.

"Thank you Ted for this article. I have to ask why my paid broker seemed to not know anything about this stock. I just purchased through my TD account (I am in Canada) and paid $7.90 CDN plus the $9.99 commission. I sold some Canopy Growth the other day.  You mention that Sunnia is looking to begin production in Oliver BC. Good location as it sits close to the US border but the cost of living there is far less than the lower mainland of BC and I presume capital costs will be much lower e.g. property taxes, building costs and a very stable population base with a stable work force, all of which bodes well for future production/growth. From a quality of life point of view Oliver has wonderful weather and yet is close to some great winter skiing so if this company does grow and increase in size this location is very good for attracting employees.  My one concern is the 'land leased from the Osoyoos Indian Band' I hope that lease is renewable and for a reasonable period of time.  i would be more comfortable if this company actually had deeded land rather than a lease. And I would be interested to know if the Band is a shareholder and if so what stake does the Band have in this company.",
"Fidelity quoted me 32.95 to initiate the trade, however you must ask for the international trading department as mentioned by Dirt Farmer...JFYI...",
"I'd like to vouch strongly for Ted's insight. Based on earlier article, I purchased Canopy Growth at <$7 USD which has yielded me >4x in less than a year's time.I regret that I didn't act on his advice regarding Namaste. He wrote an email on that stock specifically when it was hovering between $.12-$.15 USD. It subsequently skyrocketed past $3.00 and sits at $2.56 as of this writing. I'd pulled $10k USD to purchase Namaste, but at the last moment purchased more Canopy on a dip from $19 to $14. Still made money, but that $10k would have been flirting with 30x. Ironically, his article was called something like ""Namaste Overweight, Don't Over Wait.""Long way to say he knows what he's doing. There are a lot of voices out there, but this one's earned my trust.",
I was told by Ameritrade that the ticker is SNN:CN for Sunniva Inc.   He was very confused at first.https://bloom.bg/2qMprMk,
"Ted,Great find!  I bought it through Fidelity this AM.  Price was really moving and it took a while to settle the trade.  Price went from $8C to $9C then dropped to $7.01C.  The trade costs was $42 but is dependent upon how many shares you buy.  I will buy more when it hits the OTC.",

What is the current price left side Maybe it will possibly come down,
Easy to trade on Questrade if you live in Canada - the order is even accepted in registered accounts. It’s quite volatile today tho.,
"Right behind you Leftside. Bought in at $9 canadian through Fidelity. Had to call in the order and have it placed through the CSX. Ted, Appreciate your hard work. Your articles are so much more informative and helpful than all the new Cannabis writers on SA.  You were the first author here to give real time advice to MJ investors in my mind.Others interested should call the international trading department at Fidelity800-544-2976. A nice guy Trevor helped me to buy it cheaper than normal.",

"Hello Elliot:There are a lot of things happening at once that would put downward pressure on IMPAC common stock prices:  1)  Interest Rates are suddenly rising - this will affect refinancing activity2)  Mortgage Bankers Association recently forecast that 2018 would see another 26% drop in refi business for the industry as a whole.  IMPAC dropped by almost 50% last year!  3)  The frequently promised securitization of Non-QM loans has not been executed4)  The judge's decision in favor of the Preferred B holders (TIMM lawsuit) is becoming widely known - but the final cost to IMPAC is still unknown until after the Relief Hearing5)  There has been a very long period of silence since 3Q2017 report on Nov 56)  IMPAC lost the President who was instrumental in guiding/saving the company during Great Recession period7) 2017 was a terrible year - with originations down 50% and profits down to about $1 per share (on GAAP basis)8) Cash Call does not seem to function well as an originator of Purchase Money mortgages, or Non-QM mortgages.  This weakness does not bode well in a shrinking market of rising interest rates.9)  No one on Seeking Alpha has been able to explain what the strategy is going to be for 2018 and exactly how the company rebounds this year.  Consequently, investor sentiment is turning sour. Why is IMH falling every day?  Probably because of Items 1 - 9!The two bigger questions are:1) Can IMPAC turn the business around and return to the explosive growth we saw in 2016?2) At what price do you want to catch the falling knife in anticipation of the next rally?   *In a previous post, I responded to Darren with the suggestion the stock could fall to $8.60.

Any update on the preferred share lawsuit?,
"LOL, thx. CMYour spot on re: strengthening balance sheet further to boost value. Impac could re-fi/restructure preferred in a nearly cash-less way, if they do it right. Why not do it? Significantly improves investor marketability for their equity and may even lower borrowing costs for the company. All classes can do very well here and ultimately the company too.Maybe I'll see you at the next shareholders meeting...I'll be in the audience :-)",
"JW,I would like you to run for the Board.  You have my vote.  But I think the Preferred will be more than a sideshow this year.  These securities must be dealt with in a way that strengthens the balance sheet and makes IMPAC attractive to future investors - of both common and preferred types.",
"I think turmoil is the nature of the origination business. Business has large quarterly and yearly swings in volume.Impac has weathered well vs many other originators. I don't think pre-great recession pps are near-term, but I still think the upside value here is good (for all). The balance sheet clean-up continues to progress (see last year's Capital Trust exchange to common). Cash Call earn-out is over and Impac has a good amount of tax-loss carry forwards to utilize.Impac has been making leadership moves. Two were made at the end of the year. Mr. Ashmore and hiring Mr. Furey from loandepot to head the retail expansion.The pref. legal sideshow was attempt to extract value at a point when Impac was not on solid footing. Now, the company is in a VERY different place vs 2011 (when lawsuit was filed).These values rise as i-rates increase:- Servicing rights 3Q value ~$159 million- servicing portfolio continues to grow, soon will be nearing almost $10 million per quarter in servicing income in 2018- September 30, 2017, increased servicing portfolio from the end of the second quarter by 7%, bringing the portfolio to approximately $15.7 billionThese further strengthen the balance sheet:- Beginning in 2018, the contingent consideration will no longer be on Impacs balance sheetNext steps the company should undertake IMO-- Need to complete non-agency securitization when return to company is best.- expand into areas the are easy to originate (highest returns)- Need to re-structure o/s prefs so all future value flows to commonOnce the retained portfolio is generating sufficient revenue to cover operating costs+, the company should resume dividends.",
"JW,You are repeating the same old ""promises"" that management makes every quarter.  There is always talk about more Non-QM production, amazing New Technology, and the Securitization which was originally scheduled for third quarter of 2017.  And don't forget the great ""national marketing"" effort we were supposed to get with the expanded licensing of Cash Call.  (IMPAC still gets 85% of its business from the West Coast.)If the company could execute on these initiatives, it would certainly result in greater origination volume and higher profits.  But they consistently fail to follow-through on this talk. For the first nine months of 2017 - total origination volume was down 33%, which is worse than the total overall market which was down 10%.  IMPAC keeps talking big, raising expectations, and failing to deliver the goods.  I believe the company has great potential, but the current executive/board team seems unable to get things done.  The Mortgage Bankers Association is forecasting another 27% decline in Refinance volume for 2018.  Unless IMPAC does something dramatic, to increase its market share, origination volume will drop by another third this year.  With profit hovering around 25 cents per share (per quarter) we are very close to revisiting the losing ways of 2006-2014.  And if Judge Pierson is not reading the legal arguments being presented on Seeking Alpha by Keubiko - it's possible that Preferred Shareholders will come roaring back  into the picture and throw a lot of cold water on us Common Shareholders.  We had two wonderful years of explosive growth from 2015-2016.  2017 was a huge disappointment, with a 50% decline in volume and a 90% decline in profits.  Here is my prediction:  2018 WILL BE A YEAR OF TURMOIL FOR IMPACT MORTGAGE.",

Now this compares to 12% of the total originations for the same product in the third quarter of 2016. During the third quarter of 2017, the origination volume of the non-agency loans remain consistent with the second quarter at somewhere around $239.4 million. So for the first 9 months of the year, the non-agency loan production was $656 million, and this compares to $203 million for the same period of time in 2016. Despite the growth over the last year's volume, we expect our non-agency volumes to continue to grow. As yet, we have not reached the potential levels of the non-agency production and, that we expect to achieve.""""As of September 30, 2017, we increased the size of our servicing portfolio from the end of the second quarter by 7%, bringing the portfolio to approximately $15.7 billion. Our retained servicing rights increased in value to $159 million at the end of the third quarter as compared to a value of $152 million at the second quarter. That's a pickup of $7 million.""""It is our expectation that in the first quarter, most likely somewhere around January, we will be in position to complete our first non-agency securitization in the neighborhood of $350 million to $400 million""""Over the next 2 months, we will complete the testing and the beta testing of this technology with the rollout to our first customers in January of 2018. This will improve, would move us much closer to transforming into the company, to a more user-friendly lender for both our retail customers and the wholesale community. The servicing portfolio, as I mentioned, continues to grow, and soon will be nearing almost $10 million a quarter in servicing income, which will help to offset most of the fixed corporate expenses, corporate overhead expenses. These are all things that we have been anticipating in setting up for 2018.In closing, I'd like to again remind everyone at year-end, our CashCall Mortgage earnout will have concluded. Beginning in 2018, the contingent consideration will no longer be on our balance sheet and, most importantly, we will retain 100% of the CashCall Mortgage earnings with no further earn-out payments. Additionally, given our significant net loss carry-forwards, we expect to be very tax efficient into the future.""",

"The common equity has a market capitalization of $212MM this morning.  If IMH remains on the hook for $52MM of preferred, does that mean that the equity should go lower?Reason for question: Market consensus seems to be that there is a reasonable likelihood -- as seen in the active debate on Seeking Alpha -- that the consents did indeed strip economic value from the preferred issues.  The trading price of the preferred issues also suggests consensus does not embrace full value for the preferreds.To me, your argument -- that the preferred are worth more than the market is pricing in -- conversely suggests that the common stock price incorporates less than full sharing of economic value with the preferreds.

Forget the US, Canopy is in South America, Australia, and the EU laying foundation and seizing market share internationally.

"I apologize, I skipped all comments and came right to the comment box. I had to check the date of this article, I could not believe my eyes. Right up front, I found a major error in this article. Canada WILL have recreational marijuana use by July 1. PERIOD. There is no voting about it. Trudeau has intimated that he'd like to see it happen even sooner, if possible. Read this to catch up: http://nyti.ms/2qT8RudCanopy Growth (TWMJF) is solid to capitalize on this as a legacy producer with a 9% stake held by Constellation Brands (STZ). It is the #1 pot stock to own, for those two reasons and also for its heft. Canopy Growth is also working with Constellation to develop a cannabis drink that will be marketed by Constellation in Canada. It will sell well, if Constellation's business model works for it like it has for every other brand STZ has ever been involved in. I'd rank Aurora Cannabis Inc. (ACBFF) as #2 (news here: http://bbc.in/2FnRgxr) and Aphria Inc. (APHQF) as #3. Other stocks of interest to me that have U.S. medical pot exposure are, Medrelief Corp. (MEDFF) and Americann Inc. (ACAN). I own positions in all these stocks, as well as other higher-risk stocks that I won't mention. Pot-related stocks are a bit less than 10% of my portfolio.Before someone mentions it, I am not pumping them at all. These are just the ones I have found where there is a ""there"" there to invest in. I encourage every investor to do his or her own due diligence. There are a lot of marijuana stocks (something like 259 pot-related companies have OTC stocks) that represent mere shell companies. (The one being pumped here and across SA at the moment, HYYDF, I would avoid.) The ones I list above are not in that bunch.For a fairly conservative investor looking to put a toe in the water, I'd say TWMJF is the stock to own right now. Your mileage may vary. Please understand that if you do invest, you will be climbing a wall of naysayers and worry-worts. But it is the rare opportunity to be in on the ground floor of an entire new industry. It may deserve 5% or 10% of your portfolio. See what you think.",

I'm sure marijuana is a multibillion dollar industry and I do believe Canopy will take a good chunk of that market. But I highly doubt its anywhere near 6.9 billion.",
"As with every industry, there will be winners and losers. So instead of a ""basket"" of some winners and a lot of losers like HMMJ or MJX. Why not make you own basket of 5 ""winners""?  IMO #1 is TWMJF even if it overvalued here. The next four? Help me out. I also like ACBFF and APGQF, but will these be in the top 5 winners 2,5,10 years from now? Give me some ""winners"" you like so I can do more research on them. Thanks!!!! Remember only ""winners"" :):) Thanks again!",

"So a new board member announced in the sec filing today, Mark William Lane Richards, who used to be at Barclays, chairman of the board at Exotix, Ceo of IGPL. Coincidence that GCAP jumped 5 percent at exactly noon EST? Does this portend another M&A or something else? Or nothing?",
"This entire space, of course, smells fishy to a casual observer.  While there just has to be substance behind this, the many inconsistencies and anomalies in the space create loads of doubt and lack of confidence.  Take RIOT, for example.  How did this entity go from $3 to $25 in a year - actually less than a year - in a matter of a quarter or two?  I won't delve into the story - anyone can research it - but suffice it to say this is a company that was operating out of a mailbox shop location in a shopping center last year and had a strange history in pharma. More amazing is RIOT is holding above the 20 level  Then you have what appears to be an actual financial services company, with dozens of offices globally, an established institutional clientele, and the best they have been able to manage of their version of the crypto pump is a move from a multi-year average price of around $7 to $8.50 now after a wild ride up to the 20's and back in a day or two. What is going on here?  Is RIOT holding up because they have a cache of millions of bitcoins?  Well, as of September of last year they had no appreciable revenues and cash/equivalents of about $13MM and not much of anything else in terms of assets - or liabilities for that matter.  Assuming that $13MM was mostly Bitcoin, then it is now worth about $40MM.  The company now has a market cap of $250MM and something like 25% of that market cap trades on an average day.  This has all the earmarks of something that makes absolutely no sense - but I'm willing to learn.  The one thing that does make sense is the 26% of float that is reportedly short the  stock.So here's the question - how is it that GAIN, a legitimate financial services company with a legitimate entre into the crypto space to serve a legitimate institutional need is earning relatively mild enthusiasm while this RIOT deal, with a Post Office USA address, dubious at best, a sham at worst, is holding a 9X after several months?Call me stupid, an anachronism, whatever, but it just seems to me, assuming I was kookoo over crypto-puffs, and had to have a piece of it - any piece, I would pick GAIN over RIOT any day of the week - or maybe I'd split it between the two - but that's not even close to what is happening.  Keep in mind, GAIN has a longstanding track record of many profitable years including 2016 revenues of over $450MM - when crypto mania was still just a wet dream in the creative minds of the whales.It seems like with GAIN I'm getting what is basically a cheap option on crypto.  Granted, GAIN does have negative tangible equity - but somehow someone has loaned them money on those intangibles, so who am I to judge that?  It smells a little bad but not anywhere near as bad as the Postal USA guys over at RIOT.  Besides, if the crypto thing implodes on GAIN I still own a company that generates substantial operating cash flow from their trading services.",

"Having looked into Gain Capital a bit, I find it interesting that no one seems to mention much about all the M and A it has done over the years. The Management must be fairly shrewd given the volatility of the futures market. Something else I find interesting is that the new COO, Alastair Hine, based in London, was Chief Innovation Officer for IG. Then there is what I mentioned in a previous posting, where Sunil Hirani said in november that he was going to work on bringing ethereum futures to the market with a CFTC regulated exchange. With Blythe Masters as CEO of Digital Assets Holding, a company which just brought blockchain technology to the Australian stock exchange, what if Masters and Hirani are backing Gain Capital with blockchain tech for the ethereum rollout? Things could change very rapidly for Gain Capital, just like they have for Kodak.",
Very good article which balances risks and chances around the company's new crytocurrency offerings.The company just issed its December update which actually looks disappointing. But it will take more time to assess the impact of the new offerings as correctly stated by the author.,

"For once Cramer is absolutely right about  Albemarle; there is plenty of lithium around, in the ground, in brine under salt flats, even in the sea, but getting it and processing it is another matter. For example, turning brine into lithium carbonate takes a two year evaporation process.Albemarle are in a position in Chile to increase their production by a factor of five, once the Chilean government gives the go ahead, but this is for increased brine evaporation. This is one of the many reasons that the price of lithium is going to keep rising in the short term; even if you up production there is a lag before product comes to the market.As a further example, there is as yet, no lithium production at all in Europe.",Marvell Technology Can Go To $30 - Cramer's Lightning Round (1/9/18)

Based on my prior reading I'd say this concept care likely is using the DRIVE PX Parker AutoChauffeur hardware (two SoC DRIVE PX 2 variant -- i.e. more powerful version than Tesla is using) in conjunction with a Toyota adaptation of DRIVE IX software, but I'm presuming any ultimate production model would use Xavier.https://yhoo.it/2FSwd6G",

"The idea there will be 10,000,000 autonomous or even semi-autonomous cars on the road in 2 years is smoking something.   The projections must have been created 10 years.  Only the wealthy, Uber, Lyft, or another driving service will be able to afford them when they first come out.  The vast majority of roads are not built for them.  Infrastructure improvements will be a serious hindrance to rapid adoption.  In the US we are already a couple trillion behind in infrastructure spending without trying to accommodate for this upgrade.  So it’s going to take longer than people think for the sales ramp to happen.  The numbers are probably true but those numbers are for 2025/2030 not 2020.

">there could be ten million driverless cars on the road by 2020. I clicked on your link attached to this phrase and you are accurately reporting what they say, but I think they might be sloppy in their wording when they say ""driverless,"" what I think they really should have said is ""autonomous.""It's important to keep expectations in check.  I think there's a reaonable chance tfor 10m autonomous cars on the roads in 2020.  But they will be autonomous in the sense that they are L2/L3 (replace some human driving responsibilities but not all), passive safety features (like Toyota Guardian Angel), and/or geo-restricted (like the Cadillac CTS SuperCruise that just came out).  None of these applications removes the driver completely from the equation.The first true ""driverless"" cars we see on public roads might be robotaxis and/or long-haul trucking, it may not be until after 2020, and the numbers there will be nowhere near 10m for a long time.",

"Look folks, many of your concerns are valid, and vexing for my clients. I have spent a fair amount of time and intellectual capital helping some very large and smaller tech and biotech companies traverse the issue of IP ownership, control, remuneration, and predictable ""rules of the road"". It takes patience, tenacity, a significant amount of creativity, but the impediments can be successfully overcome. Having some history and relationship with government and party officials can help open doors. However, it is a very unequal negotiating environment to match a sovereign nation against a public or private company. Additionally, motivations are disproportionate. With few exceptions, most companies need access to the China market more than China wants them. Their government and regulators are very adept at playing one company against another, to obtain maximal concessions. Until recently the US government has acknowledged the problem, but been reluctant to actively help. The prospect of the US reciprocally applying the same rules and requirements to Chinese based companies that China enforces on foreign firms could be a potent negotiating balancer.China has some requirements that are inviolate. #1 is maintenance of social stability, read this controlling any irredentist movements, or party threatening dissent. EG: Greater independence for Tibet, ethnic Uyghur's in Xinjiang province, Taiwan, or any group seeking autonomy. Controlling social media is paramount. That is why GOOGL, FB, NFLX and others are not welcome unless they totally submit to government regulation. #2 security...software and code embedded in products that are networked or used in vital infrastructure. Foreign cars,trucks, and public transport products are permissible until they are self driving and networked with each other. The party and state security apparatus aspire to track movements of the population. They also view artificial or enhanced intelligence as a powerful tool to monitor threats to social stability.Promoting indigenous Chinese technology and products are a high priority, but there is some room for creative legal negotiation.China will be the first major economy to legalize autonomous driving vehicles. However, with little doubt the US market will also be going by the way of driverless vehicles - it just make take longer for US regulators to  come round.  But it is coming ...

"It's often hard to see the forest for the trees, and any mention of Tesla results in a major distraction. Your article does not talk about government subsidies, the point being is that the economics of renewable energy is approaching unsubsidized fossil fuel, and in some applications is lower (Hawaii).  Large scale, economic energy storage is a potential enabler of additional renewable generation.  Micro-grids and distributed power generation will continue to gain traction based on economics. The investments by all the big, global auto manufacturers seem to suggest that is where they think the market is going.  Bottom line? Follow the money. Economic returns are now the primary driver of renewable power generation with costs continuing to decline based technological innovation and scale. I am long AES primarily for other reasons than renewable, but their energy storage business is a nice kicker that investors get for free. Thanks for putting together the article which attracted many fine insights.",
"Generac is another one to consider in the mix. They are modernizing a line of generators to work then way most home hook ups actually exist, hooked into the grid providing power back; and mostly without a home battery just yet. It's true... The solar for a home or biz is set up for 24/7 metering $ calculations providing the grid with the excess generation in exchange for a reduced consumer electric bill at negotiated rates. The client is on a lease, purchase plan, few actually finance the systems and if they do it's a headache in a few ways. Depends on the state and the plans. The power generation is typically 6am-6pm for anticipated  out/savings calculations. This is the business TESLA got into trouble with, misrepresentation and unethical sales practices to shoddy set ups. There are still unscrupulous operators; Musk is turning it around for Solar City, they are using a storefront model and more ethical sales methods. But it is still a Wild West business, early on and growing very fast. As long as Trump does not tariff panels. Clean energy also needs talent form more established industries, better disciplined sales structures. Think talent from more regulated industry, like finance. The nature of the sales rules would help sales tremendously for solar, providing structure. Clean Grid is gaining a lot of traction and it is getting better.... The older & somewhat shady sales mentality, door to door & cold calling, the way resellers operate is The Wild West. This attitude all comes from greed; needlesssly. The desire and monies for killing carbon via 'killing watts for CECs' - Kill a traditional power plant watt for a clean = spread = CECs profiting from 20 year leases. The newly negotiated rates provides excesses of money in order to share the 'savings' (make a huge spread) which saves consumers approx 60-70%, not 100% in the end. This is for a 'free' system, not a home that buys and installs on loans;,which is very expensive. Who uses the reimbursement $$ to pay off that loan- it's single digits!! They buy a car or use it for a vacation or expenses every year instead. And in those cases complications like selling a home arise (buyer must assume the obligation). That's the brutal truth on the ground in most states now. The money is good enough for firms like VIVINT - and more eye opening to all; CMCSA now plays in the game. EV stations are a different market; the newer charging batteries and 4kwh systems are going to be huge.What most people don't understand is traditional generators do not work as one would think esp if it's with solar. Why? Well, if a generator is turned during an outage with a solar set up metered to the grid, it would electrocute people. Down wires would be live - and not detectable from a central location. So, the new ones are being built for solar set ups and will prevent this. Best;,it looks to finally power the house as consumers thought generators already worked! (for most systems in an outage). Utilities are fined every day they don't meet set % of clean grid power sources. CECs are crucial; and big oil/ utility firms want the market to grow. Big oil will eventually benefit more from the clean grid transition, I don't think that's a bad thing it's natural progress for the energy sector overall; refining and crude by products like ethylene are big in this too..  thanks for the article there aren't enough on the matter; much to look into further, JB",
