"""The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender the growth, and then earns little or no money.""  -Warren BuffettThe problem for NFLX is it can't stop spending money on new content without losing subscribers.  The only path to real profitability is to raise prices.  But there in-lies the problem, consumers subscribe to NFLX due to the  perceived value.It's really a catch-22 with only obvious answer being continued hefty spending on new content (leaving minimal earnings/FCF to return to investors).  Raise prices too far and value to consumer decreases resulting in fewer subscribers.  Cut spending on new production and lose subscribers due to stale content.  Doesn't strike me as a great business model...",

"I agree. Netflix is a ""household name"" now and that's its moat. When people think streaming, they think Netflix. I usually use Google = search as the parallel metaphor, but Salesforce is a good metaphor too.Disney, Amazon and Apple can carve out a part of the market without harming Netflix (or each other) because unlike Salesforce, one subscription does not preclude subscribing to another.

NFLX dropping to $300 isn't a crazy prediction as its more than possible if the market drops a bit . Seems like a pretty standard correction (10% off the highs) and i'm assuming they would close their short at $300. Pretty tame to me and certainly possible regardless of NFLX performance given larger market factors.,
"The prospects are strong for the future of NFLX, but come on, we've reached the irrational exuberance phase here.Stock is up 70% this year, and a 5% drop is a good opportunity to buy?

Noise folks BUT the next earnings report in mid April could go either way.  It may pull back simply because the expectations will be set very high.  With that said I would add on any pull back but leading up to the next earnings I think it will continue to keep going up so hang on for the ride.,
"Left is a hack and a tool.  Still waiting on his supposed follow up research to all the fraud he accused SHOP of engaging in by cooking sub #'s.

"Good report, good model. Not a blindly bullish crypto nut however, there are a lot of nuances not explained in this report. It would take a report that's even longer to explain the nuances which I agree sounds dicey. HIVE is a highly risky endeavor, and one has to believe that the price of crypto skyrockets in the yrs to come to believe in HIVE. For HIVE to skyrocket the following needs to happen (plain and simple):- ETH/Crypto continues rising steadily (obviously)- HIVE hoards inventories and sells at much higher prices in futureHIVE is essentially a long (out of the money) call option on crypto. One would probably conclude that if you are a crypto believer, you should just buy the coins however, there is meaningful demand for ppl to gain exposure within their brokerage accounts without the custody concerns of holding the coins (and for tax purposes).A comparison to gold miners is a stretch, imo. Historically, commodities tend to revert back to a price that is reflective of the costs to mine/extract them; which (inflation adjusted) remains relatively static over time. What's different about crypto mining, is that as the mining/hashrate/diffic... grows, so too does the cost to mine. That being the case, prices of crypto that are much higher than when they were mined, can more reasonably be sustained over the long term, unlike most commodities. This is the key point/difference.  So for HIVE to make a lot of money, crypto needs to keep rising, and HIVE needs to hoard inventory and sell at significantly higher prices than when the coins were mined. This model can be brutal at times and extremely profitable at others. Case in point, the largest Bitcoin miner in the world (BITMAIN - a private co), made more money in 2017 than NVDA, the darling of the Nasdaq. Because BITMAIN mined coins at low margins for yrs, hoarded them, and sold at significantly higher prices. Large crypto currencies cannot realistically expect to be viable starting off w/ a PoS consensus algorithm as they will be too centralized (PoS can be a safeguard against mining centralization however, only once coins are widely distributed). If a crypto starts off w/ PoS, that is a hugely centralized network. As ETH pivots to PoS slowly over a long period of time, the price of ETH may skyrocket as supply will become more visible and begin to taper. Additionally, if HIVE is sitting on a mountain of ETH when this happens, their steak can be quite profitable (and stable) should they decide to continue holding inventory if price keeps rising, or they can sell at what may be very high prices. BTC and other cryptos trying to be the digital gold, will have to use a PoW model and miners will need to be mining PoW cryptos for a long time. Bitcoin can theoretically switch to PoS when (and only when) the 21 millionth coin is mined. Again, I am not a crypto nut however, this analysis misses a lot of key nuances specific to crypto mining, and comparing it to gold mining isn't very meaningful (for many more reasons than I have cited above). HIVE is hugely risky and buying crypto is probably a better bet (imo) however, for those that want exposure to crypto in their brokerage account w/out the custody concerns and believe much higher prices are on the horizon; this isn't a bad way to participate. If the author of this article would ever like to debate this I would be hugely interested.",
"Block chain doesn't depend on crypto to exist.Cryptosporidium are FIAT $$ too but the 'say so comes people with no real authority Slow & expensive transactions and with it taking wild swings up & down who wants to take it or use it? Or hold it?If just used like many companies do now to be 'hip' Lamborghini dealers for example, they convert to $ immediately and if it has fallen in meantime you make up difference If it is just a middleman currency that will lose interest and hipness after awhile",
Here's another article related to both Blockchain and ETH (and why a company like HIVE is so much a part of the foundational infrastructure of IoE). None of the analysts (including CFA's like Ed) have been able to understand that this is all one of the areas that P0S will lead towards (and although P0S is anywhere up to 2 years down the road this is a perfect example of an opportunity for HIVE).,

"""Cryptocurrency miner like Hive can also be compared to producing gold miners for valuation purposes.""Perhaps this is true in the case of granddad/grandkids mining operation but it is definitely wrong in the case of Hive, Hut, Dash and the other large scale miners/master node operators.  Hut/Hive/Dash all have strategies of hording the coins they've mined. I don't know of a single gold miner that hordes gold produced, only selling what is required to maintain operations (looking at retained earnings. It seems most in recent days need to sell every once mined to stay in business. Other major differences of course is available ""oz"". With high enough gold prices, a lot of North America's copper/gold deposits become economical and available reserves and resources jump hugely. Not the case for cryptominers - BTC, ETH, DASH, etc. coins all have fixed cap counts.Its the NPV of future coin production (in coin being mined) that provides a reasonable basis for valuing Hive, Hut and Dash. My evolving models suggest that Hive and Dash are correctly valued today based on mining futures (I discount Hive BTC mining until they report actual coin production numbers). Similarly its hard to say if Hut is correctly valued since there is very limited data to date - I like actual production numbers and coins horded counts rather than hand waving around MW of power. Data improve in coming quarters.Thx for a great and timely article.",
"OK…I’ll try to keep it simple…too many things to comment on … I believe you are fundamentally incorrect and clearly don’t see HIVE, Blockchain, or the opportunities offered the way I do...However, how great to comment on so many different stocks in one hit piece...clearly you pick up on bits and pieces that help you...onward....1. You finally are able to admit HIVE truly doesn't fit the pseudo-cryptocurrency label you shouted at readers in your first missive, yet as of this date, and this writing, you still fail to point out that as a company, HIVE has really only been in existence since Sept. 17th, 2017 - and that this last quarter makes it truly the 1st quarter that its been operating - that is unless you wish to misrepresent the 12 days in Sept. as a full quarter. HIVE has only shown operational efficiencies in their last report but hey, you have to paint the truth somehow to support your short.2. Your explanation as to how HIVE as a miner projects their revenues, found in the paragraph starting with ""Cryptocurrency miners such as Hive and MGT project their revenue based on these main factors” with the comment ""larger miners like Genesis/Hive … have higher hash rate speeds, but lead to higher electricity costs”, fails to address and account for the strategy created by HIVE’s management (with GENESIS’ participation) regarding energy and their costs (by the way, the term computational power covers hashrates, GPU’s,rigs, electricity).3. When you state “while these revenue projections can be met or even exceeded, the most likely scenario is that these figures are too optimistic” I’d like to point out that you were wrong the last time you wrote here on SA…and we’ll see what happens with year end. What I can tell you is that HIVE is about to announce that they’re on schedule/possibly ahead of with their buildout.... and you do realize that pricing is pretty much manipulated entirely by WS (and its global brethren) these days, right?4. You comment that the ""revenue projections based on ETH or BTC future prices must be taken with a grain of salt”. This is kind of accurate; but then again, you must be looking into your Quan/Con Magic 8-Ball? Last time I checked there is a litany of geo-political uncertainty that could lead to a market meltdown ... and you also don’t mention that WS is primarily the culprit to hold accountable for the price fluctuations - Arb, Options, GREED. Moreover, that’s why a “hoard” for crypto is interesting (potatoe, pohtahtoe). See the last part of 3 for amplification.5. Your comments related to ""mining difficulty” show something….that you don’t know that you don’t know… or do you know that you don’t know? Because you post 2 very useful sites that definitely understand what they’re talking but fail to correlate the data that they show to actual earnings or projections - in fact you fail to correlate any of the data to HIVE. Moreover, at a very basic level (and what I find interesting), you demonstrate the inability to understand that Casper (P0S) addresses functionality of the network as well as fail to identify the attendant earning opportunities - and that’s why you’re not getting what’s going on with HIVE. For me, you talk about HIVE like you’re only used to the Missionary position….and while being/laying on your back may work for you, it really isn’t that exciting and misses a whole lot of everything else…and again, you fail to mention that the fluctuations in pricing for crypto has more to do with WS creating and trading on volatility rather than the underlying technology - and in doing so, fail to address core possibilities in an economy of function.So, for all of us here, please explain how the ETH difficulty chart and graph correlates to HIVE’s objectives and please also explain their correlation and importance related to Casper (or the effect Casper will have and what the data will then read) and HIVE’s earning potential with the possible switch to P0S? Please explain how you could fail to discuss forging in this piece; is that because you don’t understand? Wait, that’s one of the reasons why you needed to have me lay it out for you. It is. That’s why you asked me and that's why you couldn't write about it.6. Regarding the “difficulty bomb”…. oooh…. sooo scary…..but It all comes down to this simple point - either ethereum will persuade the majority of its users to upgrade to the new proof-of-stake-powered blockchain or ethereum will run the risk of creating another blockchain.There will be bumps on the road either way. BTW, that’s still a few years away.7. ... and to discuss Hut 8 which just started trading on March 6th…seriously, How about a big WTF? I clearly can see that you use bits and pieces of information to patch together your information. Newsflash Flash, they have not yet acquired 60 megawatts and I can tell you about their datacenter(s)…8. For P0W and P0S, try this: http://bit.ly/2FOJiO1. 9. Now for the b*tch slap you've got coming.... get to the section on Capital Lock up Costs. Since you're challenged it's put simply: In a Proof-of-Stake system, the coin holders get paid transaction fees for validating transactions. Therefore, Proof-of-Stake creates a clear and unambiguous economic incentive to hold coins for the long term. I did not stutter.10. You don’t have any revenue models to address a P0S system.I'm sure you'll find a talking point to counter this absent item.11. Furthermore, the future price of ETH (in a P0S system) can and will be analyzed based on the expected future cash flows, which are generated in the form of network transaction fees. I mean think about it, essentially, a P0S blockchain can be thought of as a decentralized Visa/Mastercard with all the additional distributed ledger functionality supported by the specific implementations... and that's important, because a Proof-of-Stake coin value can be supported by traditional value arbitrage investing. 12.  The bottom line for P0S is if Casper is a successful P0S upgrade, Ethereum and other competing POS chains (in the long run) become stores of value and as payment networks/ledgers.13. Why is IBM of the belief there’s at least $3T of opportunity in the near future with Blockchain? Why has AMEX now developed their own blockchain?14. The best comment you made in your entire piece was ""Investors would be getting a lot more value if Genesis and Hive were one entity”. That would be called one hell of an opportunity wouldn’t it. I guess that could make HIVE a takeover target. So maybe there’s a bit more of a reason why Fidelity is involved. Who would want to have a large miner as a validator/ forger for transactions? What would that kind of roll up cost…let’s say for an Insurance Company? Hmm, let’s see….15. Unfortunately,  in an effort to try and simplify my writing, most everything else you’ve based your commentary related to the ""financial assumptions made by Hive are 1) not predictable in terms of ETH and BTC pricing, and 2) not sustainable in terms of mining difficulty and costs” etc. are boring and incorrect because you just don’t understand the importance of what’s occurring in Blockchain and HIVE and why its positioned the way it is - and being incorrect at a foundational level makes everything else askew. Disclosure: I am long HIVE.",

"""One reason may be that Longfin has maintained the highest annual borrow rate (105% to 130%) during the last two months, which is a clear sign that lenders are very nervous about this stock.""@author, I get the impression that extremely high borrow rate is more due to the demand to borrow LFIN stock.  I'm sure brokers set that rate to try to pull in the maximum amount from short sellers.  I don't know how many shares are lent directly by the owners and how many are lent out by the brokers but I suspect it's skewed toward the brokers who loan out their clients' shares, either because their clients have a margin balance or through a direct agreement.Unfortunately, everyone already knows that Longfin's stock is grossly overvalued so the borrow rates and the option prices reflect that.  I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that Longfin's $3B market cap is vapor.  Short sellers who think they have a lock on the stock eventually dropping are almost certainly correct, but they might go broke being short in the interim.  There may only be about 1.5M shares in Longfin's float and that makes the stock extremely volatile which can also hurt short sellers.",

"Yep, always a good sign to see someone come out of pocket with after tax cash like we do.  It might be constructive to talk with her but I have spoken to the old CEO and liked him very much.  He owns stock too, but that didn't help the business turn around.  I was just curious if you had an operational or other thesis on what actually changes to fix the business so it can consistently make money.  It sounds like you do not but you have faith in the new CEO and know the equity is very cheap if they can manage to turn it around and i agree with you on that.  I'm just struggling to see what lever they need to pull to fix it and it seems they are too.",

Losing $2.3mm a quarter just means you have 10 more quarters before they are forced to file and your equity is worthless.  I want to believe but it looks like they are doing more of the same and expecting a different answer, really hard to tell what is going to change the money losing path they have been on.  The old CEO was a great guy and doing all he could and  it just didn't matter.   What do you think will change?",
"What now?  If you owned the whole thing what would you be doing different?  You can't dividend cash because you have lease liabilities.  Throw it into bankruptcy or give it a few more quarters of blood letting and see if things change.  It is amazing the new CEO wants to review everything, I thought the old one was the activist guy and doing all the right things and she just needed to come in and follow his path.  I guess not.",

March data shows women's clothing had its best month in 2 years.   Easy comps for CBK too.   HQ building sold for a decent price.  EV close to zero.   Can CBK report a good quarter with high single digit SSS comps and a positive outlook next week?,
"Head office sale and leaseback done , as expected they just waited for the new CEO to join.  Decent price , seems to be low lease cost although we don’t know the exact amount on the lease rate.   Good to have another 13mn+ in cash and an EV below 10!",
"Why are revenues going to be lower in 2018 ?    Stores closures this year are quite small, in fact net closures I think might be close to zero from the conference call guidance.  SSS were +5 in q4 with positive trends like in q1 and q2 especially from easy comps.   Capex isn’t 7mn, management said it would be 3-4mn going forward as the IT investment is already complete.",
That was subjective (aka emotional). What am I missing than?,
"I wan't to love this company. This is so much to love. But I don't see a path to profitability. Assuming revenue stays the same over the next year (when we know it will likely decrease with store closures leading to decreased economies of scale and margins), even if operating margins are 4% and the firm hits is Capex reduction guidance of $7M, you're still at nearly break even free cash flow. Sorry for the run on sentence. Thanks for the write up. What am I missing?",
"The cash ""bleed"" has actually fallen a lot already - the full year results included a poor first half under the old CEO and clearing inventory at low prices.  And the last few years they've also been investing in IT which has inflated capex.   The capex outlook is stated as 3-4mn $ annually going forward, substantially below depreciation and recent years capex.   Q4 is always the seasonally weakest quarter and they generated over $5mn in free cash, although this was inflated by improved working capital which isn't sustainable.   If as they communicated on the conference call there are still big gains in gross margin to come, like they started to achieve in Q4 as old inventory has been cleared and mark downs much reduced, this would allow them to generate positive EBITDA again in 2018.  I think CCI's point is very well made - nothing is certain in investing, but a lot is about what price you pay for the situation and opportunity.  If CBK was trading at $2.5+ i wouldn't buy it, given the current situation.  But at $1 it's a completely different bet.    If the new CEO ends up being decent, and they monetize the building, and see positive SSS and GM improvement through 2018, this stock is very cheap at $1.   The 42 days to cover short interest would also help move things along if there is more positive news.   I expect we will only have to wait 3 months or so to find out what the new CEO's strategy will be, and for some news on the HQ building.",
"So, what makes you think CBK can be profitable again? I get it that the inventory is looking better, and the new CEO looks promising and the comps might be at a better place. For the share to rise, the company should really turn around. If the buyers return to the store due to the new/old design in CATO and its huge cash hoard, it makes sense.What's your take for this? Ok, they might sell their real estate for 15M and total cash will be at 38M which is roughly their mkt cap. BUT, without a real positive outlook and a bleed that stops, the share might not recover...",
I think the timing of the new CEO's arrival may explain why there might be a delay in some people's minds on the HQ building and follow-on cost cutting or store rationalisation at the recent Q4 results.  It would be strange for them not to wait for her to review and discuss these major strategic and financing topics with the Board before they make decisions and announce to investors.  3-4 months from her arrival date sounds realistic timing to me on all of this.,

"Nice write up.    42 days to cover for shorts, if this starts to move on better news or a building disposal and it will be a bloodbath for shorts and most holders aren’t going to sell below 3 given their in price.   I’d also point out the big improvement in gross margin alongside the positive SSS number.  Management have clearly stated they are not focused just in SSS , they stopped discounting merchandise a lot through Black Friday and since, and recognize the need to get the gross margin back up and it was a big improvement in q4.  The CFO said this was just the start in margin and he was excited about the potential improvement on this for 2018.  They need it up another 300bp or more from here with positive SSS and you will see a major profit turnaround.  Cato is still printing negative SSS although I think the stock is interesting.  It is early days for both Cato and CBK turnaround efforts so need to be patient , and both stocks have plenty of cash.",
"The fourth quarter did not show a same store sales improvement versus third quarter if you use a 2 year stacked sss percentage.  I just see bleeding at this point.  The new CEO definately provides hope though.  I'll keep watching.  I like Cato better in this space.  Lot more cash, still profitable and they are going back to their old business model that worked well.",

"Good job, already purchased some CBK after the third quarter conference call but things did not play out as expected. There was nothing really wrong with Q4 results but investors, clearly, expected more progress after the company already reported mid-single digit SSS increases for the month of October and saw the trends accelerating further into Q4 at the time of the Q3 earnings call at the end of November.Obviously, the acceleration didn't take hold given the 5.7% SSS increase reported for Q4 against a very easy comparison. Sold my position at a small loss in pre-market last week after digesting the press release.That said, I like your thesis but I would like to see more tangible evidence for a recovery in the business to re-enter the stock.

What happens if they no longer grant credit, but demand DVP or even worse pre-paid?4) 30% of their leases expire between now and Feb 2019. If they want to liquidate this could be a plus, but if they want to continue as a going concern, this is a negative.5) Very often a  ""buying interest"" of a building never closes.

Neimans!,
"I have been saying since the day of the IPO this company can not survive. Saks,Newman’s, and 20 other companies all do the same thing. The problem with stitch is they are stuck with tons of returned inventory. At least saks, Neimans etc already owns the inventory , they send you stuff that’s on the floor. If it’s returned it goes back on the floor or maybe off fifth at the end of the season. SFIX has to order merchandise to fill the orders than stuck with the items in a warehouse when they are returned. They simply can not make money and walmart, lord and Taylor, Amazon all have their own online systems and will NEVER buy stitch fix . Zappos was BRILLIANT, shop bop is brilliant, but the problem is you need to be the FIRST, the BEST or the ONLY to ever succeed in retail and they are NONE of those.",

"Ms Harding, thx for your well thought research. You may, in the future, want to do write ups on companies that do not have such bitter anti bias. I have rarely seen hate for a company like I have this one. As a multi yr holder, every time this stock takes a dip, the howls surface about bubbles bursting. It’s one of those things where, hey I missed it, I continue to miss it, and gosh darn it, until it makes valuation sense, I will not buy! When people use pe as an end all to investing, one is 100% guaranteed to miss opportunities like this one. The enhancing of the hatred comes from Amazon now being everywhere. It serves as a near constant reminder of just how far off some investors were in sizing up this company. Trust me, if your mad in 2018, your gonna be inconsolable in 2028",
"As a stitch fix customer, when I receive my FIX, I immediately go to Amazon to see if the item is available.  1/3 of the time it is not.  1/3 of the time it is the same price.  1/3 of the time the price on Amazon is 50% less.While i like the the convenience and basically no charge (if you purchase 1 item) I don't believe this will last.

"700HK is a fascinating variation on ""too big to fail.""  If the CCP does anything to hose the Western owners of the Tencent VIE ADRs, it will destroy future confidence in would-be Western equity investors and debt investors, in Tencent and in the other Chinese tech companies.  Westerners have short attention spans (behold Equifax), but Asians have long perspectives, and, as most people do, they assume everyone else (us included) is like them.  Thus the CCP, of which Pony Ma is an official, and the Western Tencent investors' interests are aligned.  The CCP is not stupid enough to do anything to cut off Western funding of their tech industry or of the One Belt, One Road initiative generally, because they know that would cut off Western money, at least in the short-term and maybe the medium-ish term, and maybe longer.  And hosing Western investors would cut off continued deals with our US tech companies, run by naïve Millennials, which the CCP relies on to facilitate intellectual property ""sharing"" with US companies.  I hold TCEHY as way less than 1% of the total, as a potential multi-bagger, but definite source of fascination.  GLTA.",

Could you show how you calculate Beta? Thanks!,
"Excellent article and follow-up discussion. One thing that struck me was the similarity of the graphs. I was getting the feeling that these must be the same company.

"These companies do not move with the market, they move the market. That's why high beta. Causation is the other way around here. Here's what I'm saying, the very composition of SPX (the ""Market"") and the arithmetic of beta works such that the highest weighted stocks move the lowest weighted ones. So when you say that the market moves these companies, it's not exactly the case. What do you think, a move in AAPL (highest weighted in SPX) will move NWS (lowest weighted on SPX) or the other way around?...and from this follows my hypothesis. Overvalue has more probability to be found at the lower end of SPX than at the upper end. Of course, not that you cannot find stocks like AMZN, NFLX etc. which are overvalued despite being at the higher end of SPX. That's why the qualifier ""probability"".",
"Buying FAANMG at these levels is just pure stupidity, but if or when they fall is anyone's guess.

"Thank you for the article. Some observations of the behaviour of FANG led me down a similar path of thinking. As someone else mentioned, the difficulty here is that FANG make up a large part of NASDAQ so computing their beta vis-à-vis this index can result in a distorted view.  What I did instead was to compare the relationship in the returns of FANG against S&P or the DJII.  In addition I focused only on extreme up and down days (+/- 1.50%) because I was most concerned with the resilience of the stock during extreme events.  I observed that for some of these companies, when the market really went down, these stocks suffered more than others. At the same time, when the overall market goes up these same stocks didn't go up nearly as much. This relationship has changed over the past year.",

"Oleh,Very good article, interesting perspective. I enjoyed the fresh perspective and agree to some extent with your conclusions. Thanks for sharing.One question though. You use a 1 yr rolling beta based on the previous 270 days. I wonder how sensitive the result would be to shortening the timeframe ... say to past 100 days.",
"I think what is truly scary is that everyone owns these stocks in individual portfolios and redundant ETF's or indices and that they have had a disproportionate impact on overall market returns, meaning they represent a large portion of total returns. If you look at the simple earnings multiples of these companies you get a different take; AMZN  257, MSFT 75, AAPL 18, FB 32, google 63. They are clearly some differences. Its also true that the more a company grows the harder it becomes for that company to maintain or  improve its EPS growth rate. In the end the PE ratio simply tells us that if we invest 1 $ today at current valuation say in AMZN if will take us 257 years to get that 1$ back assuming the company can maintain that rate of growth for the next 257 years. Now I know that AMZN has gone up a lot and might continue to do so simply because of fund flowing into the stock, or ETF's owning the stock, but the valuation at which the stock trades is indeed scary... Well at the high of the technology bubble I think Qualcomm at a 2000 PE so go figure,  on March 1st 2000 the stock traded at 74 USD...and 17 years later the stock trades at 59 and todays analyst average price target is 71.44 still below where it traded in March of 2000. At some point EPS much catch up with the stock price or the opposite will occur. I think the author is using a different metric to illustrate the idea.",
"But, but, but...it's different this time. Many of the current retailers in the FANG stocks have NEVER experienced a bear market. They will learn just as others have learned. Just another reason 9beta) that this market is way over bought and facing a ton of head winds in the next year or two.",
"A simpler way to manage your risk is to limit your position size. I own AMZN, GOOG, FB and AAPL. The only one that is over weighted is AAPL - for obvious reasons. Currently weighs in at about 18% of direct ownership of stocks. If we take into account indirect ownership through funds in 401k's that figure is probably closer to 25%. However, our initial investment probably is closer to a 4% figure, so we are playing with house money.We got into the other other 3 companies much later. Always thought they were over valued. But when we pulled the trigger, our position size was small (<2%).This method of mitigating your risk, IMHO, is much simpler to implement and much easier to understand.Just my two cents.",
"Well ,that’s why for every seller ,there is a buyer! We might not always get the price we want but we buy and sell. One man’s ceiling is another man’s floor. I’m pretty sure that 5 years from now all the faang stocks will continue to rule the roost because they will be buying the new gamechanging technology because they can! These CEOs live , breathe and sleep technology. They didn’t get into this position by chance. I don’t believe in coincidences........",
I think you should short them all. Seems logical based on your study. Good luck.,
"I think the author needs to learn from his mistakes. The quickest way for him to learn is to start short positions on Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft.  He can then get back to us and let us know what he did wrong here. Here's historical perspective: 20 years ago, Amazon was going for about $2 per share and now it's going for a tiny bit more than that  (about $1,600 per share). So, guys, this may be the mistake of a lifetime but I think I will hold on to my ridiculously over-valued Amazon shares. One of the comments above points to the only thing that could stop the likes of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, and that would be excessive government intervention. The referee, if you will, would have to interject himself into the game and cheat on behalf of their competition.

"The author gives off an initial impression that he's a really smart guy (and I'm sure he is). But he lost me with this little line:""And probably we can predict the moment when the cycle will change.""I do not claim to be all that smart but Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook will just keep outperforming pretty much most stocks out there. They will just keep making billions and billions of dollars from the cloud (microsoft and amazon)  and from online advertising (facebook and amazon). The rate of growth will be very high and these companies just own the field of play. If Buffett thought it was a good idea to own the Washington Post or Capital Cities ABC back in the prehistoric times (because everybody needing to advertise has to pay the newspaper and the tv stations)...imagine the sheer and total dominance of companies like amazon, google, and facebook today. The squiggly lines on a graph cannot show you that. Historical graphs will not show that companies will be spending tens of billions more in online advertising with each passing year and the companies that will benefit will be google, facebook and amazon. Couple that with Amazon and Microsoft's dominance in the cloud and you start to get a clue that maybe the stock prices of these companies will keep going up.",
Beta=risk is one of the true mistakes of financial academia. I’m with Buffett and Graham that risk=losing money. Obviously these stocks will have a high beta now as they have outperformed a consistent prolonged bull market. Not saying some of these stocks are not overvalued but there are better measures of value and the risk of a loss in value for investors who live in reality instead of academia.,
"It all comes back to the essential question if you believe in the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) or not. What has always intrigued me is the fact that Beta is dependent on the time frame which means that you get different messages depending on the time frame you apply, the same is true for correlations. Results differ depending if you calculate them on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. This usually overlooked aspect let me doubt about the concept of Beta and I prefer multi factor based quantitative models because they better reflect the reality of the stock market.",
Past performance is not indicative of future results ...,
Beta is not used by Charlie munger or Buffett. NEXT!!!,
"All indices show a way oversold situation, he is right for his reasons and many others are right because of their stance on a grossly oversold market.Time to take some cash off the table , there will be many buys maybe sooner than we all think",

Over the last decade, those are the companies with highest growth rate and every day, their beta increased because their market weights grew.Why do you think it's an extraordinary event? It doesn't make sense to compare the current beta to historical values for this sector and conclude that they are at risk...",

"Is the HAIR technology proven? The machine certainly looks like something out of a Star Trek movie. Mazor has a stellar track record concerning the surgeries outcome + number of surgeries, which one can easily find documented on the internet. Would be interesting to know how many successful surgeries have been done until today with the Artas robotic system if one can obtain such information. Why is HAIR's COO (still) bald????",
"The author asks for information about other medical robotics stocks.  I would like to suggest that we expand the definition a little to include nonrobotic companies that are planning to enter this market as ISRG patents expire.  Examples include Metronic, Johnson & Johnson, and Google.Further afield, there are a number of Chinese companies entering the field, see :   http://bit.ly/2GwcTNn",
Why will HAIR not “make it”? I think you spoke with out thinking or knowing. They have previous members of ISRG. If anyone knows how to grow a robotics company it’s him. Did you not see their latest earnings report and that growth? They will own the whole market with their ARTAS system.,
Mazor is a great stock and will do well with the MDT buy in / Sales agreement to sell the product.  I have owned since $34.00  Great company with a lot of future potential.

"Hmmm... thought I had lost access to the article.The Investment Doctor:  To answer your question more fully.....I use EV/BOED, EV/CF, ND/CF and EV/EBITDA to get a rough idea. Typically I use trailing, annualized FFO for cash flow and fully-diluted share counts.After-tax NAV@10% based on 2P reserves per fully-diluted share count is a key metric. In the case of GeoPark, I adjust the measure by subtracting IGI's share of Colombian and Chilean reserves, by applying zero to reserves in Peru and by applying zero to P2 reserves in Brazil and Chile. Probably should apply zero to all of GeoPark's Chilean reserves.  After all those adjustments, the shares still trade at a healthy discount to NAV@10.In the case of Parex Resources I subtract the net working capital surplus from market cap to get enterprise value.  Still trades at a 10% discount to NAV@10 which is an indicator of how leery the overall market is with respect to o&g e&ps.  In a context of greater market enthusiasm, a company like Parex should trade at a healthy premium to NAV@10.  As Brent Crude edges towards US$70/bbl, maybe the mood of the market will change?",
Wonderful.,
"Parex's assets are for the most part distant from the guerilla hotspots in Colombia, found mostly along the borders with Ecuador and Venezuela.Production was temporarily halted in the Capachos block after the ceasefire with the ELN ended  but recently production was resumed after extensive consultations with contractors, employees, local communities, police and army.  This is a very well managed e&p.",

"From DNBLPG SHIPPING SECTOR Zero US export growth in 2018 Since 27 October 2017, our LPG peer group is up 5% compared 6% for the Oslo Stock Exchange. Although US LPG production grows according to forecast (up 8% YTD YOY), a surprisingly strong US domestic LPG demand (up 15% YTD YOY) and lower US LPG inventories YOY has led us to forecast zero US LPG export growth for 2018, for the first time in seven years. This puts both utilisation and rates under pressure to an extent where the peer group’s liquidity could become a concern. Thus, we have reduced our sector view to neutral. Lower rates on lower utilisation. We have lowered our rate forecast for 2018e to ~USD12k/day (down from USD21k/day), 2019e to ~USD18k/day (down from USD31k/day), and 2020e to ~USD28k/day (USD36k/day). 2018e tonne-mile set to decline 1%, while fleet growth set to grow by 3%. We forecast LPG tonne-mile demand growth of -1% for 2018e (down from our previous forecast of 8%), while we have raised 2019e to 13% (from 5%) and 2020e to 6% (from 3%). We have increased our 2018e fleet growth forecast to 2.8% (from 2.5%), 4.0% for 2019e (from 3.0%), and reduced our estimated fleet growth for 2020e to 0.4% (from 1.7%) due to higher scrapping assumption. US production materialised, but surprising demand growth hampered shipping. In our October sector report entitled “It’s coming, but with a slight time lag” we said US LPG production was set to catch up with US oil production growth and accelerate through the year, which it did as Q4 2017 posted 9% YOY growth in US LPG production and YTD is up 8%, in line with forecasts. Still, US propane/propylene stocks are below last year, while net exports YTD are down 22% YOY. Unlike last winter, when US exports led to excessive stock draws, this winter has seen a sudden rise in US consumption of 7% YTD versus the five-year average and 15% YOY after 0% average growth in the last 20 years. We believe cold weather and rising US petrochemical demand are to blame, prompting reductions in our 2018 forecasts, in fact leading to negative growth in US exports YOY, before an improving US balance in 2019–2020e. Last time liquidity was a concern, our peer group was trading at 0.3x NAV. With our LPG peer group priced at an average 0.67x P/NAV, just slightly below its four-year 0.74x average, we see more downside than upside risk with our new 2018–2019e rate forecast below cash break-even, which is set to challenge all three companies’ liquidity. During autumn of 2016 (the last time liquidity was a concern), our LPG peer group was trading at 0.30x NAV, suggesting 55% downside potential for the group. We have downgraded BW LPG to HOLD (from BUY) with target price of NOK31 (down from NOK45), Avance Gas to HOLD (from BUY) with target price of NOK22 (down from NOK28) while we have kept our HOLD and USD8.2 target on Dorian LPG.",

Long Player good article and interesting discussion.,
"I got this response from obsidian’s IR on FF’s latest letter:Thanks for reaching out and providing your view. As outlined in our press release, the Board and Management team are taking decisive action and aggressively looking at all options to unlock value in both the short and long term. We will have more to say in due course once we file our proxy circular and will welcome the opportunity to discuss this directly with you at that point.",
"Well the FF rally seems to be over. I was able to make some lunch money selling some shares around $1.02 and buying them back around .97. A guy has to eek out a living somehow.I suspect the stock will hover around 95 cents USD for the next few weeks. I will also speculate that if FF wins the vote the stock price will go down when shareholders realize they put dumb and dumber in charge of the Board. The stock will further languish because FF will finally realize they do not know what to do with a company once they get one. Nothing will have changed except the accrual for $25 million in legal fees the company spent to fight FF.Still holding my 450,000 shares hoping that when this episode of ""FF does wall street"" is over, the fundamentals of the company will takes us over $3 CAD where we belong.",
Sorry but the RS along with the continued hedging  in 2019 has been the last straw for me.  I don't know if FF will be better but given the above it can't be worse.,
"One of the Directors Front Four is proposing used to be Ican’s lawyer and the other three have more oil experience than any current director on the Board. The reality is that to get a share price up, you need an exciting, high growth plan and deliver. What French has proposed is a boring , low growth plan with no excitement. Front Four’s plan is exciting. Get rid of legacy assets, pay down some debt, focus and grow strong,y your low cost oil production area and buy back shares...simple and exciting...what’s not to like?",
Best of luck with your investment. I don’t think you have experience in stocks rattled by activists. This company cannot continue down the same path. I expect a sale to be imminent.,
There is no justification for such hedges in this environment. Please do not make excuses.,
Just wondering if you still think oil is going back to $45 soon - hope not.,
"this stock is going to soar, I loaded up on the SEPT 18 $1.00 calls  and am not looking back......oil up over 3% today, a total draw of 6 mil barrels when we usually see flat or inventory builds.

The stock is up 10% after FF sent out the letter now that’s creating shareholder value.  I have not seen the stock go up that much for awhile.,

Obsidian Energy has a refreshed Board with significant shareholder representation that is committed to value creation in both the short and long term.

"I like Four Front’s plan to sell assets , pay back debt and buy back shares. The US stock market is at all time highs because of share buy backs and Canadian energy stocks are at all time lows because few of these companies buy back their shares, even at really depressed levels...makes no sense....Hard to understand why The Obsidian Board would not want to buy back its shares today since they are trading at  only 35% of book value? They expect shareholders to buy and see value when they don’t buy...pretty hypocritical?Four Front has a concrete and aggressive plan. French has a slow growth , job security, plan.

I wrote OBE and told them I think the job they are doing is AOK.... if FF wants 4 board seats while only owning ~6% of the stock they need to put their money where their mouths are.... these guys remind me of the fox trying to raid the henhouse IOW they are their for their own good and I will help OBE defend the henhouse... OBE's plan is better in the long run then what these shysters will end up doing by selling off the company and walking away with more than their fair share when they get their hands on it which is typical of what these types do... there is nothing in their plan that gives me a single warm fuzzy...,
I read the letter just would like an explanation as to why it moved stock so much in after hours. Because split might not happen?  Thanks for taking the time to help me understand,
"Kind of playing out like I thought. FF drives price lower by about 35% by raising a fuss and now they will try to draw the desperate shareholders into giving them 4 board seats ( yes 4). If you want to take over the company FF offer me some money for my shares and buy the interest that entitles you to 4 Directors. Do not expect me to hand the reins over to you for free. Their share holdings would give them 1 Board seat at most.I see the after market price is up. If it holds into tomorrow, I will take some gains on the beaten down shares that I bought during phase 1 of the master plan of FF.",
FrontFour is moving.  I’m with FF.  Convince other shareholders to be with FF.  This is our chance.  Let’s be united.  FF is against reverse split and they want to sell assets and organize buy back.https://yhoo.it/2GLVqjX,

"Another stock at incredible prices today is Painted Pony, PONY. A high growth company with no balance sheet risk . They bought a lot of high quality land last year and paid for it in stock which existing shareholders didn’t like so the stock is down over 60% vs.  a year ago at $1.99 per share!! Trades at 35% of book value which IMHO is really, really, cheap. Most funds and institutions are run by short term thinkers who have dumped shares mercilessly. The selling has dried up. Even on a huge down day today, the stock was up a penny. Loading up on PONY and OBE and waiting for a few years is the strategy to huge gains?",
"The way to look at OBE’s pre-mature hedging is that the stock is the buy of the year. There is a very small percentage downside at current levels and hundreds of percent upside.The Board has a former managing director of Credit Suisse, a former Vice Chair of RBC Capital markets and a Chair who spent decades in senior positions at Suncor. To me this is amazing.The CEO is Harvard educated ,McKinsey and Co., etc., In short, awesome management and Board. Relax, load up on the shares and wait for the double or triple. Warren Buffet has never sold a single share of most of the stocks he owns, over several decades. That is how you become rich. Not by worrying about ten cent moves here and there...",
"Way to go guys. That take down of the hedge book was masterful. If not for the hedge book to defend against another down spike, we're 2-3. End of story. $60 oil, it'll take 12-18 months...to $3. You guys drill down good. Don't lose the big picture. This gig has been analysed to death since 2013. Too bad about the hedges. Load up and wait for Suncor or..",
Good work Long player I was wondering if you could tell me how much it cost the company when they forward sold 12000 BOE at 50 for a year instead of waiting for the current 60.   My esitmate is   12000 x 90 days x $10 per barrel  =  $10.8 mill for the last quarterAs your article indicated this company isn't in dire straits ..... over a yea it's 40 million or about 20% of cash flow lost     Please check numbers,

"The name change to Obsidian, volcanic glass, was really prophetic.  The Company appears to be about as dead as volcanic glass.",
Putting a plan for 25% of op cash flow for buy backs.,
not impressed. I am currently engaging with the other activist to pressure buy backs and capex at 70% of CF. Already with email to frontfour and Ed director. PM me if you own OBE and dont want the consolidation and improved shareholder treatment.,
"No business is successful without good management and a great board of directors. Obsidian has the management “A” team and a Board that is second to none. Smart people figure things out and the people running Obsidian are figuring things out and the business is trending positive nicely.Once the stock gets over $3.00 per share due to the consolidation, it will become marginable which means many more institutions and funds will become potential buyers of the stock. Because there are so many funds and institutions that can’t touch the stock at current price levels and because the stock is unmarginable below $3.00 the consolidation is smart and necessary.",
"LP, I'm surprised you like OBE so much more than PGH. While OBE thus far has demonstrated superior cash flow to debt they plow it all back into capital inefficient capex, so what's the point? Without a dividend or debt payback aren't they just treading water? I agree with the activists that management is failing to exploit a fantastic land position. They need to sell a major piece to raise funds for major drilling in the Cardium, buy back stock instead of doing a R/S, and stop hedging into backwardation.",
"wow, LP is bullish on OBE. Good to hear that))",
"LP—you are right about the reverse split. A piddly 1 for 3 won’t do anything, except give the shorts more to chew on. A 1 for 10 or 20, plus a modest dividend, would become an investable proposition for way more investors.",
Beauty/Value is in the eye of beholder.  Let's see as they make progress one day at a time.,
Right on. Good points. Shareholders need to be confident and patient. On the other hand they need to do activism to warn the management,
"Good article and I share the optimism of LP about this stock. We need to see a break in negative sentiment about the entire sector before there will be a break out. Could happen any day now or 1 year from now and that is what is driving so many investors to the brink right now. I think this is a great name if you are patient but if you want to see something immediate, you need to go outside this sector.",
“Some of the remaining production is legacy production that will eventually be sold”Let’s just hope they won’t be given away but if they are don’t do any announcement it’s better for the share price.,

"Nice job Long Player.  Unfortunately Mister Market is not impressed.  OBE needs to work to improve shareholder value. Since OBE, like most oil and gas companies is just a bucket of reserves that are depleted over time, a portion of that depletion(funds flow) should be returned to the stockholder in the form of  cash dividend.  If that is now coming in the near future, OBE should be sold since the funds flow and reserves seem to be worth substantially more than the current stock price would indicate.

I am long WY and receive a dividend rate of 6.5% based on invested capital. It is my most speculative holding. I believe as the author that the land value is at book level and it is sorely undervalued in today's dollar. I also believe that the housing boom is continuing to grow and this bodes well for WY; it literally grows its inventory. It manages its resources very efficiently. While I am waiting for price appreciation I will collect a very nice rate of return on invested capital. Nice article.,
A reference article for this industry. Thank you!,
great article - informative,
I have been in WY since 1969-- never enough to get a Xmas card- but learned that is a constant refrain-- undervalued and not enjoying general Mkt value-- still a very cool company in terms of what is doing--growing and maintaining its own inventory,
"Backed into WY several years ago via the Plum Creek merger, and have bought more since. Doubles as an income generator and an inflation hedge (timber) for me.Happily long WY.Retired income/dividend-growth investor",
Nice analysis. For me the extra kicker for WY has been that the dividends are distributed as LT cap gains. With the decrease in tax rates starting in 2018 that bonus becomes a little less valuable but it is a value nonetheless. The southern timberlands continue to be rather disappointing.,

So is the thing that allows them to be profitable now the fact that their depreciation is too low because of the impairment, and once they lose that benefit they´ll fall back into loss at current energy prices?",
ive been chuckling for about 5 minutes on your comment before i could type a word... sadly i remember ramen  noodles at 10 for$1.. pure fat and salt which is everything an 18 yo wanted besides beer. i still think this company will be packaged and sold somewhere over next 3 years. the thing that wakes me up in the night  is the dam argument of brent vs lto...   humans never surprise me at how bad they can shoot themselves in the foot ie permian and lack of infrastructure. you get a 4 year high in oil and then take a $12 haircut because its coming out of texas by camel caravan.. so i have upped the % of integrateds of an almost all oil portfolio . if you want to tell me bp/rds can go up 30% in next several years and pay me almost 20% in dividends over several years ill be in clover. first we have to get lpi back on track. thanx Pablo,

pablo.nice try/effort. those spreads are outrageous.. . they should be working on a way to get better prices.. i guess i hope that some infrastructure build out in the permian might get them a better price. its interesting to me that 2 years out the diff drops into the -60s. i wonder if the waha sees these boys in the permian having a way to deal with the ngls natgas by 2020.. once again good try. if they can find a wagon train to lower those diffs it drops to bottom line and would be huge.,

"One of the big advantages to LPI is their conservative reserve assignment philosophy for PUD reserves.  Basically, they only assign what is to be drilled within the next year (at most), even though most companies would include all locations that could be classified as PUD by their engineers within the 5 year window for SEC reporting.  That ""should"" allow them to continue to report reserve growth, but it also obscures to some extent the true reserve quantities and values they have.As far as FCF goes, a company that is growing by 15-20% with little debt concerns is provided more flexibility than companies that have negative FCF and are struggling to grow production ... or generate enough cash to allow for the ultimate repayment of debt at upcoming maturity dates.",
"I agree LPI looks undervalued, especially for a Permian producer. Bought small position for 8.45 on Feb 15 based on my valuation of 10.4 at $50 oil. Good job covering risks & rewards. Reserve adds were heavy on revisions, which were equal to extensions & discoveries, especially N Gas & NGLs. On the plus side, a high 88% of reserves were proved developed.",

C'mon Michael stop fooling us here. This can't be an O&G company. Let's see; Reduced debt in 2017 and therefore interest expense. Only a minor increase in the number of shares. Living within cash flow.(almost)  Yet they grew production 17% and replaced reserves at a rate of 29% and 336% of 2017 production.Obviously the GOR is a problem going forward but they are improving the Oil cut.,
cal.. i want to say very hedged. maybe 80-90% for 2018... price not so sure on...the hedge % has been a small point of contention.. the good thing they will roll off hopefully at higher spot prices,

Thanks for the article Michael.  Will definitely add LPI to my watch list.,
This was a good read but I was surprised to see comparisons drawn to PXD as they're not really comparable IMO.  LPI is perhaps undervalued but let's see if LOE and service costs can remain contained in 2018 or if that takes a bit out of income for these companies.,
I agree that this is a good bargain especially with such little debt.  Oil will continue to trade in dollars for a long time since the dollar is the best parking vehicle (for funds) on the planet because of its relative safety compared to other currencies.

For readers' convenience, I'm appending excerpts on this below:""On a given day, ATHX management is at the forefront of decisions and updates that will arrive on market news desks after a delay (see the Healios announcement). Assuming the company knew that this information would likely cause a pop in the stock price, placing an order with Aspire to buy shares would likely modulate the impending price appreciation by creating additional buy volume. This can magnify a move upwards in the share price and result in strong up days being even stronger... With this same line of thought, as the share price goes up, the amount of money that ATHX receives for each purchase also increases - decreasing the total potential dilution to other shareholders.""Nicely done.",

"Sad face, CQH is pretty simple.  Each share of cqh owns approx 1.03 units of cqp in a blocker Corp (after full conversion of sub units, but sub units are earning distributions, so who cares about conversion?). At some point the blocker Corp will have to make tax sharing payments to LNG parent. Until then, CQH’s dividend yield is just a pass thru of CQP’s dividends.  Because each share of cqh owns 1.03 units of CQP, the dollar dividend payout will be higher until the tax sharing starts.  Because cqh is a blocker Corp, it can be bought by offshore hedge funds and IRAs.  I love the discount of CQH relative to CQP.  Further, my guess is that LNG parent should/will/possibly announce an exchange offer for cqh holders to voluntarily exchange 1share of cqh for 1 unit of cqp that cqh owns.",

You could feasibly make more money as a long lending your shares to shorts if the company survives long enough as opposed to being short even if the stock goes to -0-.   Having followed this company for the past 10 years, my impression is that longs can't get beyond the notion that an iconic company like Sears may ultimately fold.  The best argument for owning the stock was the real estate/asset value argument - that is until the best assets started to be sold off while debt and losses mounted.  This is no more than simple math - or at least simple math should be able to support a long thesis.  Frankly, if someone other than Lampert were running this company it might warrant a second look.

Several companies have been bought out like Tigenix who are further along. Mesoblast is superior to ATHX in the same respect. This seems like a poor man's stem cell company. So why invest in it?,

I am VERY interested in seeing the ARDS data which he said should be in a few months. I am hoping he was being conservative and would like to see results happen by May...... especially if positive.,
"Your explanation re the sharks makes a lot of sense. Just one more question. Why would Healios possibly exercise 10,000,000 warrants by buying shares directly from ATHX  ""at a premium"", rather than at the going market price?  Maybe they had to commit to this in exchange exchange for owning 19.9 % of ATHX?  It  also implies, that you don't think the SP of ATHX will not  go above $4.25 by Sept 1,19. At any rate , I am looking forward to the near term catalysts such as ARDS and clenching the TBI study on Apr 11,18.",
"Of notice: after Sept 1,19 there are no more warrants issued. Most likely reason: the 1 year trial results of IS are about to be published and that will sky-rocket the share price!",
"WST, thanks again for the updated analysis.",
"Excellent and very informing article. Impressed that one of the sources (Healios) that is most likely to know whether or not the Treasure trial may be progressing as positively expected? is actually putting their money where their own capital and research seems to be leading them. I feel much more confident now in the mid to long term speculation for ATHX even though any possible gains? could be as far out as 2020? but hopefully it appears as if more positive news may come before then? It's been one heck of a ride for longer term ATHX investors but feel better now that ATHX appears to have the capital raised to help prevent much further dilution, we shall see? Note: I still want to see MUCH better ATHX shareholder updates and know more about how many hospitals/clinics in Japan are being utilized by Healios in the Treasure trials. Also, would like to know how expeditious Treasure/stroke/ARDS enrollment etc. is actually going/progressing and when the 90 day Treasure results may be released or if only the one year post Treasure completion enrollment results(2020?) will be released? Thanks again for an excellent article.",
Thank you WST for another great article. I am long with ATHX and kept on adding at every opportunity. I am a close follower of your articles on ATHX as they focus on the science and facts rather than unfounded fears or pure pumping. Truly appreciate your insights. Thanks and good luck to all the longs.,
Always enjoy reading your articles. Great work!! Thanks for keeping us all informed with the details. So happy to see this partnership expanded. Great validation for MS and great longterm development across the pipeline.,
"Great article. Well written.   When you speak of Meso's GvH trial success and Tigenix, you can also add RTI Surgical's use of Map3 as an active agent for immunosuppressant.  They sure seem to like it and continue to promote it. Nobody has ever given me a direct answer but my guess is that this is unbranded Multistem.   Thanks again.",
"I couldn’t agree more, thank you WST. Another very informative objective article. Your opinion and insights mean a lot to us. Could you explain where the shares that Healios will be purchasing come from - why they would not be dilution -i.e. buying additional shares that would be issued by a Athersys?",

what about intel,
"The author patently does not understand Tesla. And he seems to not be willing to understand the car business, either.A) Tesla does NOT have ""500,000 orders"" for the model 3. It has about 400,000 cancellable  ($1,000) RESERVATIONS. A huge difference.B ) He says: ""It all boils down to the success of the $35,000, 200-mile range Tesla 3"". Except, the $35,000 version will never be produced in quantity, as Tesla would lose a fortune per car sold, at that price. It still manages to lose a very considerable amount on the $45,000 version. No realistic synergies will ever compensate this.C) It gets worse: ""It’s all about scale. If it can produce these cars in sufficient numbers, it will take over the world and easily become the next FANG."" I am sorry!? Your statement implies that Tesla, theoretically but realistically, could sell tens of millions of cars per annum. This is what ""take over the world"" means, in the car business. I remind that VW and Toyota already sell over 10 million cars per year each. And they have NOT taken over the world, or been awarded a valuation even remotely close to 1 trillion dollars. In fact, VW is worth less than a tenth of that and Toyota less than a fifth.D) ""Any of a dozen competing electric car models could scale up with a discount model before they do, such as the similarly priced GM Bolt. But with a 10-year lead in the technology, I doubt it."" What 10-year technological lead?? Has the author seen the Jaguar I-Pace, or driven the new Leaf? Much more importantly, is he aware of the upcoming (within 18 months) fierce competition from, ehm, the likes of Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Porsche, Citroen, Volvo and even Ford? Many, if not most, of these will have a superior technological solution, as even Indian Tata (owner of Jaguar) has already proven.E) ""It isn’t just cars that will anoint Tesla with FANG sainthood. The firm already has a major presence in rooftop solar cell installation through Solar City, utility sized solar plants, industrial scale battery plants, and is just entering commercial trucks."" Again, gross misunderstanding of the situation. Solar City has simply been rescued from bankruptcy by Tesla. It is now being massively scaled down. So, it is shrinking (and eventually it will be closed down) not growing. "" Industrial scale battery plants"" are just a joke, and I urge the author to check how that ""division"" has been selling since beind established. Commercial trucks is, at best, a fully unproven business. Moreover, the selling price offered at the moment by Tesla is patently much lower (in the order of  $100,000) than break-even. As of today, it's just another hype event-publicity stunt; not a business.To his credit, and to end on a positive note, the author does recognize that: ""To say that a lot is already built into the share price would be an understatement."". Then, unfortunately, he offers the above ""reasons"" for why Tesla could reach a valuation of 1 trillion dollars. As none of them has any validity, Tesla will not only NOT reach a valuation of 1 trillion, but might instead go bankrupt. The chances of either happening are skewed more than 100 to 1 in favour of bankruptcy.",

"The compensation committee used metrics like EBITDA and safety record to justify the 2018 CEO compensation.  Just how much control does the CEO have over EBITDA or safety.  He does have control over the cost of production per ton which has gone up slighty during his tenure.  But he does not control the spot price of iron ore which relates directly to EBITDA.  Also how much control do you think a CEO based in Cleveland, Ohio has over miner safety in mine in Minnesota and Michigan.  Both of these metrics need to be adjusted.  Take safety out that can be controlled on site of each mine not by some person in Cleveland and instead of EBITDA why not adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EBITDA would show how the CEO and his financial team are lowering debt and interest rates which directly affect company earnings or adjusted EBITDA.  But no the committee chose metrics it does not control in an effort to justify how great a CEO LG has been.  The metrics are biased and do not show anything other than site safety procedures have been working and that the spot price for iron ore is going up especially when porous sales volumes are considered.  Biased views by the compensation committee.",
"Anybody read the new SEC DEFA14A?  Seems Cleveland Cliffs board is trying to push through new compensation measures.  It should not pass.  LG took over this company when the stock price was over $17 a share.  The share price hasn't been close to that price since.  He also destroyed shareholder value by continually diluting common shares.  He has also gotten nearly a million shares in one-time accomplishments.  Like the Nucor agreement, buying Tilden mine shares, and MT negotiations.  These are all expanding CLF's business.  He is already paid to do this he doesn't need more incentives to drive the business.  Once again if he doesn't like it he doesn't have to be CEO.  The truth of the situation is that CLF's overall value has not changed since he took over.  LG may have changed the direction of the company but he has done nothing to improve the over value.  He is profiting a all shareholders considerable expense.",

"Meanwhile as we comment, 2000 people will die monthly from acute bleeding related to Factor Xa inhibitors. When will the FDA respond to the death knell? As truck88 stated, the data for this critically ill patient population was from my 30 year experience as a vascular surgeon spectacular. Putting an 80 year old individual with Afib on a Factor Xa inhibitor is a bad science project waiting to happen despite valid indications. AndexXa is the only antidote short of an act of G-d that can reduce mortality and morbidity in this patient population. I say that as a physician/surgeon and an investor.",

"Live presentation was a problem for me because I could not retrieve the visual power points to support their findings.  I later returned to the archived conference and realized how truly spectacular were the results.  The reversal of factor X inhibitors caused very few issues. Mortality and thrombotic incidents occurred during the thirty days which followed bolus and infusion.  These problems occurred  predominantly the large segment of patients with intracranial  hemorrhage (ICH). This group presents a particularly difficult dilemma even after the initial bleed is under control. physicians orchestrating subsequent care must make a decidedly difficult decision whether to restart anticoagulants (risking an even more profound second bleed) or to wait on restarting ""blood thinners"" (chancing a deadly thrombus, especially in atrial fibrillation). While  Portola's study revealed an overall mortality rate of 12%, the ICH group in the Reverse A-D study suffered a much poorer outcome.Listen carefully to the last question by Mathew Harrison in which he asks whether Portola may wish to seek immediate approval from FDA for use of Andexxa in ICH alone.

"Up to know, it just shows that AMD CPUs are more secure than Intel CPUs since to compromise the Intel CPUs, you don't need access to the hardware, don't need administrator access, don't need flash the bios, don't need  tocome up with an extremely complicated malware, and don't need upload a genious software into the encrypted/secure chip/os areas (as you will need to do if you want to compromise AMD cpu/os).So between AMD and Intel processors AMD comes up much more secure than Intels, and Intel is the only one that suffers from the Meltdown, which is the most dangerous one..This report seems to on the contrary show that AMD hardware is overall more secure than Intel's current hardware..In addition, like Linux said.. Having access to the bios and having access to flash the bios and embed all kinds of information on the bios just makes that server/data system totally vulnerable to all kinds of hacking.. for Intel, AMD, ARM, APPLE, SAMSUNG, etc..",

When will the downtrend end. The stock is already $3.30 below its high.  Those who bought it around 14 last year are paying a price by having a loss.

"I can see a defined group of AMD investors that base their conclusions using different knowledge bases.

After seeing AMD latest release of new cpu,gpu,apu, and mcm fabric  architecture and products, I think AMD has a solid architectural, product, and future generation growth to become one of the greatest new technology companies in this decade.Of course, anybody from the other groups have their own opinion and will think I am crazy. But after following AMD, Intel, NIDDIA, IBM, Qualcommm, TI, Apple, Samsung, etc.. for 30+ years and working with several of their technologies for decades, I think AMD is recovering in such an historical way that I think Intel and some other companies are freaking out of their minds..Again, I am long on AMD, and several other stocks/fund,. and in my view, I am sure I will retire early with my AMD past and future profits... good luck to everybody in all and any of your investments..If you see AMD current state.. It already has released all their new cpu, gpu, apu, and infinity fabric architectures and products, so their status is that of a company that is ramping up profits that it lost (cpu area) and continuing to profit in other areas (gpu) , creating new markets for brand new unique hardware (high-end HSA APUs where low performance discrete gpus are not necessary any more), and with AMD using infinity fabric chip and MCM architectures/fabrics to linearly scale multiple cpus, gpus, and apus processors for processing large and very large data.. The first generations of EPYC, ThreadRipper, and Ryzen were first class, and their seconds generations with 7 nm, Qualcomm LTE modems, VR wireless displays, etc.. will be more than brilliant products, knowing that Intel is years behind having brand new architectures that can compete with AMDs incoming generations.. Intel has been using expensive chip components to try to outperform AMDs new architectures, and that option is not working any more. In the GPU area, AMD Vega is more than a hit.. even more knowing that AMD is selling their Vega high-end GPUs to Intel because Intel's integrated gpus are history.. but Intel sells 200 million integrated gpus (now obsolete) that Intel is replacing by the higher performing AMD Vega, which means AMD has the potential to sell 200 Million extra gpus if Intel wants their products to be able to compete against AMD products.. doing the math.. Intel 200 million gpus represent 70% of all the gpus sold in the world per year, NVIDIA and AMD sell the other 30% of gpus (integrated and discrete).. that will put AMD with a potential of 80% of all the gpus sold in the world.. Intel does not have a choice because currently all of its integrated gpus can't compete with AMDs APUs containing Vega gpus..  OEMs are strongly buying products from AMD, with close to 60 new products coming from AMD in 2018.. that's a fantastic growth in cpu, gpu, and apu markets.. while Intel is constrained to only the cpu market with low performing integrated gpus..",

"Intel used to have all kinds of BIOS security issues.  And its strange, too, that Intel employs 10,000 people in Israel, where is where this dubious and  research came from. It only gave 24 hours notice to AMD, and the shady research company already had colluded with Viceroy which in 2 hours released some news emphatically mentioning that AMD was worth $0.0We all know Intel is desperate because it is losing huge CPU market share, it does not have high-end GPU technology, and because of the latter it completely lacks a hybrid HSA compliant CPU/GPU processor architecture, which AMD calls APUs, and Intel lacks too an Infinity Fabric to linearly scaling chips when combined in MCMs.. Intel is back to its backstabbing and unethical behaviors, like when it used to pay AMD customers to not buy AMD products, and all the well known fake-news Intel likes to inject into the news media.. Like when before its high-end GPU project folded/failed, it used to pump huge amounts of news saying that with its new Intel GPU AMD and NVIDIA were dead, which caused AMD and NVIDIA stock to go down significantly, but it ended that Intel Larrabbee project failed miserably and Intel had to go and beg NVIDIA for their integrated GPU technology/licensing and not it has to beg AMD for its Vega GPUs, which AMD APUs with Vega completely obliterate any Intel integrated gpu chips.http://bit.ly/2tLKDnb",
"You folks don't seem to understand what these vulnerabilities means for AMD and its revenue. In a nut shell this just rule them out of any government, corporate and server farm use.The vulnerabilities results in a easy to use pre-made vector for state actors to pre-compromise your servers. All they need to do is intercept your gear, install malware and you will never know. And lets say they can't intercept. It's also not difficult for someone to be bribed in the IT team to do the work. And the risk is so low for the IT person because how many infosec teams knows how to figure out something like this happened? Think now about what this means for average joe buying a new computer or a new CPU to install. Your underpaid local computer store (or someone at the online store) can now install spyware that your antivirus cannot find. And because these sort of things eventually gets packaged into easy to use script kiddies solutions, that could easily happen. And if you already got one of the affected CPUs, do you trust now sending your computer in for repairs?The Intel bugs are pointless in comparison. The persistent nature of the firmware you can load into the security processor in this vulnerability is way way way worse.",

I think it's good to point out the probability of recent 'fake news'. However this does not make AMD perform LONG. Right now AMD isn't even on 2007 performance levels (financial).,
"From what I'm reading the threats are real, though difficult to achieve externally, they are quite easy internally with the right access. The biggest concern my techies are whispering is that if a system is compromised there is no easy fix, rollback, system restore, or anything that can be done. Furthermore, one would have to suspect the system is compromised, as the threats operate outside the realm of detection. An example would be, Mike from IT was acting weird and suspicious before he suddenly quit yesterday. Since we can't tell if he did any funny business on our AMD machines let's take some precautionary measures. Oh wait, nevermind, anything malicious done won't be fixed by anything we can do. Seems like we should just buy new AMD servers/workstations. That's the only solution at the moment. Or maybe we just get Intel machines, at least we can roll those back, apply patches, and detect funny business. Yeah, that seems like the better solution. Let's do it. Someone call maintenance to throw out these AMD machines. And get me an Intel rep on the line. We'll need overnight shipping too.Generally, that's the concern at the moment from two folks I know in this space that manage large systems. They don't have AMD systems/solutions but AMD has been a topic of discussion in their meetings as of late. It's a CTO's nightmare scenario. Undetectable infected systems that can be compromised by any of the dozens of folks with the access to get it done. Imagine a financial institution employee deploying this mess while on the job as a respected and valued member of the senior IT team. Then he leaves on good terms, citing early retirement and family as reasons for leaving. Moves to, I dunno, Cuba, or any non-extradition country and does whatever cybercriminals do with access to banking servers.I know AMD only had less than 24 hours notice but they better get out ahead of this quickly as there are folks out there thanking God they took the wait and see approach to AMD tech. Folks holding out to make a decision between more Intel or pickup some AMD will now be dissuaded from AMD for the time being.Sucks to be an AMD long these days. I really like their tech but what a concerted attack if I ever saw one. Reuters: unusually high shorts leading up to CTS and Viceroy reports today. I'm reluctant to even jump in on the swing trades, which I've been hoping for since last week. Might have to just call it a day on AMD.",

"I’m waiting anxiously for their presentation for their in EASL this year. As I commented in S/A elsewhere the academic community as of last month were unacquainted with its findings because of lack of publication in peer reviewed journals. Quite a few years back I attended an EASL meeting in Europe where ICPT presented their findings in Rx of their success in treating NASH. The stock price rose to over $ 500 per share. For several years I kicked myself for not buying any. But I never fully understood why obeticholic acid could actually “cure” NASH since there are multiple conditions that are known precursors of NASH and it was unlikely an extracellular molecule could have that kind of impact on an intercellular event to that degree. After a few deaths, it’s now clear O/A is only good for some cases of PBC and PSC. Now ICPT is back to $ 50-60’s. When MDGL first presented it’s findings recently I thought to myself is history repeating itself ? Over the years I found the best financial advice one could get is to actually attend the scientific national meetings here in US or Europe. Talking to the presenters actually give more insight than listening to financial analysts. Of course if they knew I’m only an investor probably they’ll just ignore me. Having an MD degree probably open some doors. I’ll continue to do due diligence by attending scientific meetings whenever papers are presented of interest to me",

However, they have raised my dividend 25% on average each year, which is one of the main reasons I own the stock. Based on the slowdown in the US same-store sales, it is tough for the company to command the 25+ P/E valuation the stock has commanded for a number of years, but I do believe the metric is coming more in line with expectations as it gets below 20. I do think China will have a HUGE impact going forward regardless of the politic issues. I do believe the Roasteries impact will be felt as more and more of those locations open. In one day, though its vary early, the roasteries have been making double what a traditional store makes in an average week. The roasteries will have an impact in revenues and will obviously have high margins based on the reserve items they sell. As I mentioned, it is still early, but I am looking forward to see the impact of them and the continued growth in China. Long SBUX for the time being. All the best, Big Ticket!",

If the latter, it would be useful to see a chart of  China comps alone, to see if China comps are ascending.  Even if sales volume in China is less than USA volume, this could change in future as China’s economy grows. 2) Will the new rules (FASB) affect ALL companies in SBUX’s sector equally?  Perhaps SBUX will continue to look better than many of its peers.3)  You “see much better value in other names in food and beverage”.  Care to mention those better names?

"Agree with all the other comments here on interpretation of FASB ASC842.  The change will debit assets and credit liabilities.  As for Starbucks in China, the locations I’ve been to in and around Shanghai have been top notch, great experience.  The menu is definitely tweaked for the culture.  Drip coffee is an American (North and South American) phenomenon.  In Asia Starbucks doesn’t even serve Pike’s Place Roast...it is all espresso, tea and cold fusion drinks.  Culturally appropriate snacks and pastries too.  Prices are still at a premium and people pay for it.  China growth potential is real. Brand is strong.",
"You are not correctly interpreting FASB ASC842. Yes, Starbucks will have to recognize a large amount of operating lease liability on its balance sheet, but it will gain a large offsetting ""right-of-use"" asset - it's not going to suddenly wipe out shareholder equity. There will be an impact to the Net Debt to EBITDA ratio, but given the relative lack of leverage this is a not going to significantly impact borrowing availability. To me, the key questions on Starbucks are 1) do you buy into the long-term potential in China and 2) do you believe in the menu innovation they are delivering in a highly competitive restaurant environment?",

"FYI.   GE looking to sell its LTC business.  Chances are, in my opinion, GE will actually have to write a really big check to get another insurer to assume such policy liabilities.  The value of the block is negative.Worth noting is that GE hasn’t sold any new LTC business in years but retains the excess risk on reinsurance and much of that was written on the same exact policies on Genworth books today.   It is important to understand, that GE Capital, with all of its sophistication from the legacy of Jack Welch, under-reserved its LTC block by $50,000 per policy.  (Readers can do the math here and step into the shoes of state insurance regulators and think about the Genworth shortfall if it is anywhere near $50k per policy on a fraction of the 1.3 million policies on Genworth books.   Even if there is a shortfall of  just $10k per policy on 500k policies, the number is about $5 BILLION.   Penn Treaty shortfalls were more like $30k per policy.)QUOTING BELOW////////////////////May 22 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is working with investment bankers to find ways to shed its insurance business, which has caused it to book hefty charges while sparking shareholder lawsuits and an investigation by U.S. regulators, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The move comes after GE announced in January it would take a $6.2 billion after-tax charge and set aside a further $15 billion in reserves to help cover liabilities in insurance operations held by its GE Capital unit, mainly concerning long-term care (LTC) policies.While GE's insurance operations have stopped generating new business, existing contracts managed to maturity in a process known as run-off have become a major financial burden for the U.S industrial conglomerate.GE is hoping investment firms which specialize in acquiring run-off insurance businesses could buy some of the assets, the sources said. While GE is focused on shedding its troubled LTC business, it is open to divesting other insurance assets, including structured settlements and other life and disability products, the sources added.The sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential, cautioned that no deal is certain given the liabilities that GE faces in its insurance business. A GE spokeswoman declined to comment.GE spun out much of its insurance business in 2004 into Genworth Financial, itself currently attempting a sale to China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co for $2.7 billion. That deal has been held up by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a U.S. national security panel.GE said in January a review of its remaining insurance portfolio showed 300,000 policies needed $15 billion more in reserves to cover potential payouts, or about $50,000 per policy, on top of the charge it took as part of its fourth-quarter earnings. It subsequently disclosed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had begun probing how it handled its insurance obligations.",

Setting this timeline, they are probably midway through the investigation stage with CFIUS,  Roughly 4 months since Delaware notice around disparity in valuation April 13th - Shelf filing. Which could mean a whole lot of different things, it was also noted they were looking for ways to reduce debt consummate merger, possibly an IPO filing for US MI.

Maybe we would benefit if they let MI go into runoff.  The dividends to the parent associated with this(from excess capital) may match the debt maturity schedule and therefore avoid prepayment penalties.,

so you think they are wasting their and our time refilling?has no sense I think they need time only,
"dienteI didn't say it was ""on track"" at all.  All I said is they extended the deadline.  Nobody seems to know if they have a good or bad chance with CFIUS but considering this is the 4th refile, it is obvious that the process has not been smooth.  It seems to me that GNW recently had a dispute with the NY regulators and probably not going to be able to fix the issue unless Oceanwide writes a check for another $300 M.  (The details are explained in GLIC-NY filings with the NY regulator.)  Delaware apparently hasn't even scheduled a hearing, so it might stil be hung up there.It is pretty clear though that the holding company did not have sufficient cash to access to pay back debt due in May so they had to borrow another $450 M of some fairly high priced money hoping that it is enough to tide them over in case the Oceanwide deal closes at a later date.   Too bad that McInerney sucked in so many investors.",

"I wonder how many people would continue to defend Genworth's CEO after seeing the ratings on GLIC. If they have information which would contradict those findings, I'd like to see it. No one wants to see GLIC fold, but the CEO is working hard on it. Should the ratings improve, I'd be more than happy to change my outlook as well!",
HoopsThanks for your input.  My guess is that you find it easier to shoot the messenger than to fall on your sword defending the CEO of Genworth and the mess he created by plunging into LTC when all the other major insurers selling the product were running away from it.   Most tried to sell the LTC business and found that they would have to pay somebody to take it.   And Genworth kept selling more and digging a bigger hole.,
whats behind the price action today?,
"China Oceanwide really wants the deal to close.  If it closes, Genworth becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Oceanwide -- at that point, I very strongly suspect they don't *care* about the unstacking.  Their stated goal is to expand the LTC business to China.  So I don't think the Delaware discussions matter in the least.They've also been willing to abandon the termination fee, waive all the merger requirements one at a time, and loan $60 million to GNW.  They want it and they will inject however much money they need to to get it.  (After all, it then becomes their investment vehicle, and once it's properly capitalized, they don't have a problem getting profits out.)  And they already have the money for the merger and the capital injection (and more) in the US, so they don't need permission from China.Oceanwide wants it bad enough they aren't going to try to renegotiate the price.  They just want it closed.The question regarding the merger is, IMO, entirely about CFIUS.  This is a complete wild card due to the total chaos in the Trump administration, which has not staffed most of the positions on CFIUS and keeps firing people.  I find it impossible to put a probability on the merger given the CFIUS situation.",
"If premiums and interest rates are sufficient to warrant a positive outlook for GLIC, why are the ratings continuing to slip? Wouldn't the rating companies have been aware of the income/outlay picture? GNW isn't selling life/annuity any more because they don't want to, but surely they would want to sell LTC. How could they expect to do that with such poor ratings?",
OskeeI suggest you call up a licensed insurance agent in what ever state you reside (probably Illinois) and ask them if they will sell you a LTC policy from Genworth.   See what they say!!!,
"If GNW is fated to be a shrunken company, which looks all but inevitable, the only hope at this stage would be a profitable shrunken company. I can't see this happening under current management, which seems fixated on throwing good money into the LTC sinkhole. The company does seem to have some value (probably not for long), but how to consolidate that value into a smaller but viable entity? Could a competent management team figure out how to do that? Maybe not, but they couldn't possibly be worse than what we have now.",
"No point on commenting on Cooke's article, but plenty of holes in it and author has a long way to go to defend his logic and apologize to he unfortunate investors he influenced to buy GNW   Apparently he got some inside info on Delawares objection to unstacking.  The LTC fiasco is not behind them by any means.   Genworth did some cash flow testing just for the GLIC-NY and came up about $400 million short.  They hope to close this with premium increases but have agreed with the NY regulator to infuse another $300 M into the NY sub in the next two years.Where is the cash for this $300M capital contribution in NY going to come from???  They promised the NY regulators to cough up the money.   NY is never going to let them off the hookI have no idea if Oceawide can still salvage this deal or if CFIUS will eventualy approve, but if they can get it going, the price might have to be reduced substantially    It would be subject to shareholder vote, but the last time GNW asked for a vote on the $5.43 price there was minimal resistance.   Some 96% of votes cast were YES at a price of $5.43.  They will likely easily get more than 50% on a much lower offer....in my view.  In the last voting, about 25% of shareholders did not bother.Biggest issue for GNW if Oceanwide deal collapses still remains how the parent holdco can pay down debt and interest costs if it cannot extract upstream cash from regulated insurance subsidiaries.   The life companies are basically dead meat and can operate legally with junk financial stability ratings but are unable to sell new business for probably the next decade.  The US MI operation is subject to PMEIRS rules that are not yet finalized and may restrict any dividends upstream to holdco.   Rising interest rates and PMIERS concerns are destroying Radian, which is a decent company and whatever happens to Radian stock might be a good forecaster of what happens to GNW's MI business.GNW will likely sell its Australian operationg here and is reported to be working on it now.  They may sell some of the interest in Canada to meet debt service.   They may have to reduce  growth in US MI or sell off blocks of business to meet capital standards of the GSEsEventually it comes down to a shrunken company and the bondholders having a great deal of clout where shareholders are basically screwed.   It's not a bright picture.  How did they ever get into a mess where holdco debt service can only be met by paying upstream dividends from REGULATED  insurance subsidiaries?   It's the financial structure of a madman.Perhaps GE paved the way and iuntill recently, a former GE exec was a GNW board member.  GE got itself into the same box where GE Cap is stuck with the obligation to set up another $15B of LTC reseres and cannot pay upstream to the GE holdco which was forced to cut itss dividend and the stock has been awful.  Same flawed financial structure thinking at GE was apparently used at GNW.",

The fact that the LTC book is not great is already well known, and there doesn't seem to be any indication of a huge reserve increase being necessary this year. It may start becoming a consistent positive income flow with the premium increases and inexorable passing of time and the lapses/mortalities that come with it.",

"Current LTC policyholder for 20 years monitoring all aspects of GNW. Also retired Forture 500 Chief Auditor so have solid command of above financial discusssion and generally agree with A. Cooke  from financial view. However ,given recent liquidations of another LTC firm ( Penn Treaty which collapses owing $4 billing in unreserves future LTC  claims)  seems to have State Insurance Regulator unofficially agreeing that GNW LTC (which is like 10 times bigger than Penn Treaty ) unit is too big  to fail and openning gate for future reasonable premuim increase ( which i personally do not want to pay).  Therefore I support A Cooke opinion that GNW is worth more than CO is willing to pay. Separately seems USA is on edge of a new problem not unlke the federal banking regularors failure regarding banks ,AIG  &CDS.  The new potential  Black Swan events may well be related to this ineffective State Inurances regulation methodology that has  50 different set of State Insurances regulaors ( and 50 different State Insurance Reserve organization ) all loosely provided guidance by a cental association that is attemtping to play way above its paygrade. These 50 sets of regulators are consistently inconsistent and soon or later the this problem will surface from the shadows and the Amercian voting public will not be happy.  Perhaps Co will up the deal  to  obtaiin GNW's massive expertknowlege & volumes of LTC data that is worth a fortune to CO to apply to China's  aging populations which can be used to address wide open LTC market in China/ Remember China is a country that bulit 22 million autos in 2015 which is more than the next 4 countries combined. China is changing rapidly and LTC solution are imperative to the family life changes. .",

OW has certainly been acting like their fully committed to the deal. GNW said that in a PR but more importantly, OW was the lead participant in the recent note offering. They also just refiled the application for the third time a few weeks ago. I tend to think CFIUS let’s the transaction slide by after the big QCOM blow up. Mnuchin doesn’t want to go on TV to explain why a stock is blowing up again due to a CFIUS issue when he just said the QCOM situation was “unique” and not part of a greater protectionism narrative. CFIUS rejections are rare and it seems unlikely they would do another high profile rejection so quickly after QCOM. It probably wouldn’t have been such a high profile rejection pre Qcom but now all eyes are on CFIUS. Plus, it would be kinda absurd for CFIUS to make them refile three times, for GNW to comply with all stipulations like third party data, and then reject it 1.5 years after the initial file. QCOM was rejected within a matter of days after CFIUS started looking at it.",

"These are a bunch of executives talking about all their great plans for 2022, but with no tangible real evidence they can pull it off.   First off, Volkswagen might be hitting $100 per Kwh in 2022 or maybe later and using that figure today, whereas Tesla is hitting their cost structures today and getting better in the future.    In the end, Volkswagen, much like very other car manufacturer will be losing ICE sales as they compete for EV sales, whereas Tesla has no dying legacy business.  By 2022 the real battle will be in the autonomous driving space anyway.  And the sales of any vehicle that is not autonomous will be plummetting.  Tesla has built the brand, the charging network and other car companies have legacy car dealerships that must be broken to compete with Tesla.   If Tesla cant do a better job of getting volume manufacturing going, then they wont win the future, but to believe Volkswagen, based on a presentation, is the future of autos is a huge mistake.  The real investing thesis to come out of this is that the oil industry is going to plummet within 5 years.",

After all, if you have been the Chief Accounting Officer for Musk, that's all the training you need to pull the wool over a lot of people in Europe.Since nobody wants to examine TSLA's financial statements, why should the cost of batteries mean anything?  Why does it matter how much Musk/TSLA owes Panasonic?  Why bother wondering about the actual impact on TSLA from well-heeled OEM beginning to break down the door for the opportunity to give Musk an ulcer.  None of these otherwise important issues mean much when the company is already insolvent.

Here is a more revealing comment from someone closet to GF1 than Anton will ever be:What a lot of people do not realize is that GF1 is multiple factories under one roof. The ""shotgun shells"" are manufactured on the Tesla side and sent over to Panasonic. Those are turned into finished cells and sent back to Tesla. The cooling tubes for the battery packs are manufactured on the Tesla side, and the cells are mated with the cooling tubes there. The motors for all of their vehicles are produced here. When this place is finished, ~ 10 billion cells per year will be produced here every year, enough for more then 2 million cars. This is what the shorts do not believe, or do not understand.The cost of creating the battery pack is the real factor in the cost of the vehicle - and I doubt if VW is ahead of Tesla in that respect..and notice that the motors are made at GF1 not Fremont.",

"Interesting report, Anton, thank you.One correction, if you will. You intimated that Tesla is spending $1 billion on Panasonic's Nevada factory. Actually, the number is quite a bit higher.Per its most recent 10-K, Tesla, Panasonic, Heitkamp & Thumann (cell cases), and Valeo (drive train components) together had spent at least $3.5 billion on Panasonic's factory in Sparks, Nevada, (also known to some as Tesla's Gigafactory).What's the breakdown on that $3.5 billion? It's impossible to know as of 12/31/17. The best we can do is from the data in the latest report out of the Nevada Governor's Office on Economic Development, dated as of 6/30/17. As of that date, Tesla had spent $1.642 billion, Panasonic had spent $956 million, H&T had spent $57 million, and Valeo had spent $9 million.We have a pretty good idea from the 10-K and from the agreements between Tesla and Panasonic that Tesla is required to pay Panasonic back (over time) for the Panasonic equipment, plus a return on investment. To my knowledge, Tesla has not revealed what its arrangement is with H&T or Valeo.So, Tesla has spent at least $1.6 billion, and likely more, and is obligated to repay Panasonic's investment of at least another $956 million.And, of course, the factory is about one-third complete, so there is more spending to come.Will that give Tesla an advantage over its competitors? I suppose it will, if Tesla's competitors decide they made a mistake choosing the pouch cells instead of the older cylindrical cell design, and if the competitors decide it makes sense to buy the old-fashioned cylindrical cells from Panasonic and bear the shipping costs from Nevada.Don't smirk at that idea. There are some audiophiles who still prefer tube amps over solid state.",

If companies like this gain enough info. on us, and they do, they can direct ads to us and mold our beliefs. I've learned recently that this is not the only company that bears serious scrutiny. Cambridge Analytica was founded by Robert Mercer, and his family founded Cambridge Analytica. Mercer funded the Trump campaign. He and Steve Bannon engaged in widespread pro Trump media.

The company has said that it uses secret psychological methods to pinpoint which messages are the most persuasive to individual online viewers. The firm, which is the American affiliate of Strategic Communication Laboratories, in London, has worked for candidates whom Mercer has backed, including Trump. It also reportedly worked on the Brexit campaign, in the United Kingdom.Alexander Nix, the C.E.O. of the firm, says that it has created “profiles”—consisting of several thousand data points—for two hundred and twenty million Americans. In promotional materials, S.C.L. has claimed to know how to use such data to wage both psychological and political warfare. “Persuading somebody to vote a certain way,” Nix has said publicly, “is really very similar to persuading 14- to 25-year-old boys in Indonesia to not join Al Qaeda.” Some critics suggest that, at this point, Cambridge Analytica’s self-promotion exceeds its effectiveness.

"FB is not close to hitting maturity. Can you name one large cap growth stock that has posted FB like growth numbers and then suddenly hit maturity? No- you cannot because it has never happened. FB’s advertisers are paying about 40% more YOY to advertise on FB. Why? Because advertisers get a high return on the best targeted advertising anywhere. As long as advertisers get a good return on their investment they will keep spending. 2017 revenues surged almost 50% including the most recent quarter. The momentum is way, way, too strong and will not suddenly decline sharply. When FB matures they will slow capital investments enabling operating margins to surge. In other words, there are many years left to compound the bottom line by 20-30%. FB is not near this inflection point. In all likelihood, FB is the single most underpriced large cap growth stock- bar none.

Apple need to raise eps to please Wall Street when you have a president like trump  trust who expect a lot of volatility for greed,
"IMO Apple should significantly increase R&D for a few years, and get a few back of the envelop ideas into final stage testing... Several hundred brainiacs walking in a circle (Cupertino campus) must surely be able to generate a few, 'one more thing(s)'.",
"SMH at comments suggesting Apple pay off its cheap debt. That would be an expensive mistake and colossal waste in opportunity cost of the economic value of buybacks. Take corporate finance 101 and come back here : ). Unless the company utterly fails, buybacks will provide great returns in excess of the after tax cost of debt. Shareholders will benefit greatly from these returns. And scaredy pants shareholders who sell out will get a slightly better price too thanks to Apple picking up the volume.",
they are going cash neutral...holding enough cash to payoff debts~$100 billion,
"IMO, AAPL should clear its debts before considering dividends and buybacks.The remaining cash should then be used for expansion purposes and should consider buybacks and dividends only after they resume generation of greater FCF.If they spend all the repatriated funds on dividends and buybacks, they will only slow down their growth (at the expense of greater EPS)",
Increase the dividend too,
Gimnick should be Gimmick,
what's a gimnick?,
"We have a $290 5-year price target on AAPL providing about 59% upside from the current price! The company is well managed and still trades at a very reasonable multiple. Question marks remain about all of AAPL's cash and how the company will utilize it, however we believe in Tim Cook. AAPL is one of our 30 holdings in our ""Wide Moat & Profitable Growth"" portfolio and we feel very comfortable with this stock and our anticipated return. Feel free to check out our portfolio and newsletter here: http://bit.ly/2uQ4t0h",
Apple’s ROE is almost 40%.  So buybacks are a no brainer.,
Buybacks are sensible when they are paid from FCF and not debt.  A responsible way foreward for Apple would be to  steadily increase dividend by a minuscule amount ( say a penny a share ) over the long term. That would position Apple for dividend growth investors in a mature industry. Whatever  FCF remains after paying dividends and growing R&D should be used for buybacks. My crude rule of thumb would be FCF allocated roughly:15% dividends 40% Buybacks 40% R&D  5% reservethis suggests in next 2 years; ~$125b buybacks or ~12% of Market Cap.,Apple Cash Neutral: Smart Capital Allocation Or Corporate Gimnick?

Power companies should embrace it as it gives them extra revenue to build out their sustainable energy developments and sell their energy at off peak hours to crypto miners.  Hive can also be seen as a play on ethereum, currently ether has found support at the $500 level.  If ethereum goes up, it should push Hive up with it.

Disney does not need Facebook to successfully compete against Netflix. However, it does need to understand what makes Netflix successful and position itself effectively against that. Netflix and Disney can reasonably coexist. But I imagine 99% of the people on this board can only imagine the two as vicious competitors akin to the Lakers & Celtics rivalry, rather than monopolistic competitors similar to Coke and Pepsi (or UPS and Fed Ex).",

"Great article, Ziyaad!I read it because my two largest positions are (painfully) short NFLX and long DIS. I really enjoy articles that make one think hard about business and financial strategy! I had never considered FB buying DIS, but on reflection, it would make sense for FB. It would give Zuckerberg nice diversification and a lot of great tangible and intangible assets. It would provide a nice bump to FB's image at a time when big tech is being view by politicians with concern and skepticism. While it is just speculation, I would think that the Murdock family would probably be pretty happy with such a merger (assuming the Fox deal closes, they will have considerable clout).  I do think that FB's marketing reach and technology expertise would jump start DIS streaming subscriptions.  FB has the information readily available to target parents of younger children with deals on DIS streaming. Two anecdotes: One of my millennial sons has a 2 year old. Whenever we are out and about and the toddler starts acting up, my son pulls up an animated DIS movie on his NFLX app and sets his phone in front of the toddler. It is magic!  My other millennial son has a 3 year old. I try to get the kid to watch Sesame Street with me, but he will not have it. He insists on watching a Mickey Mouse show, which from my perspective it is worthless compared to Sesame Street. But DIS obviously understands how to appeal to 3 year olds!  For anyone with kids, Disney streaming will be essential - much cheaper than babysitters!Zuckerberg might have to abandon his insistence on maintaining disproportionate voting control to get a deal done. However, he might be intrigued by the idea. It think being Chairman of Disney would be a good position for a person with future political aspirations. Plus, he and his wife now have a baby - and so will be personally introduced to the Disney magic.  P.S. Zuckerberg/FB could short the hell out of NFLX and cover a good chunk of the purchase price as the effect impacted NFLX subscriber growth!",
"DIS needs to position itself as premium, subscription-based, ad-free to come up to par with Netflix while Facebook is going to be ad-supported, free, and aimed at getting Millennials to watch ads by giving them short, stupid viral videos. Two whole different worlds and brand images.DIS should focus more energies on taking over Hulu to turn it into viable global service at long last, and figure out how to package it attractively with ESPN and the Disney kids service so that together, it will be competitive with Netflix.",
"The numbers indicate Dis will be 60 in a year and will drop huge just like xom did.Which others are next to drop, could be fb, aapl, gild, ge, amdand more.",
"Disney will never work because the government will not allow a ""National Champion"" (especially one that is soon to have Rupper Murdoch as a shareholder) to be bought out and you also have take into consideration assets that FB is probably not interested like the cruses, the parks, etc. If we are going to ""out there buyouts"" them may I suggest another one? There will be a limited number of streaming services that will ""win"" the ""streaming wars"". Two years ago I would have said just buy NFLX but since that is probably off the table then I'd suggest them to offer $90 to $100B for Time Warner. FB would then either sell or spin-off assets like Turner, CNN, Warner Bros, etc while keeping HBO, B/R and similar digital oriented assets. The money from the sales of those assets should serve to significantly reduce the price of the transaction, reduce the regulatory burden, and allow FB to either have a better balance sheet or acquire other companies in which case I would suggest Take-Two interactive, Zenimax (I know they have a lawsuit but there is nothing some billions can't fix), Discord or Even Spotify to further build up a non-advertising business.",
Nobody is buying Disney. But these sentiments do prove the consensus that Disney+Fox are not big enough to stop Netflix. Netflix will be equivalent to TV in 10 years.,
Haha you think NFLX will have 140 million subs by 2019 hahahaha thats laughable with all the cash burn they'll have to keep raising fees Im sorry NFLX is NOT replacing cable,
Twitter has less influence tell that to the president elect and those who say Twitter got him elected are you for real jmacbb.,
When you buy real estate you save money when you look were nobody else is looking but has potential such as public transportation and good schools and close to the city etc.. Right now Twitter is coming on its own and is ripe for the picking so why not FB & TWTR. I tell my kids you should be saving when everyone else is buying and bidding against each other driving up the cost and when the shit hits the fan and it will you will save thousands. My thoughts only. FB will save Billions if it bought Twitter instead of Disney.,
"Honestly, I just don't think this makes a ton of sense because neither of these actually needs the other.  I just can't imagine the combined entity being worth more than the sum of the parts.",
"FB could buy Twitter outright  and its lights out on live streaming for everyone else.( FIRST IN NEWS, POLITCTS, CONCERTS, SPORTS, HOLLYWOOD EVENTS, INVESTING  BLOOMBERG,) The big part of this is it is GLOBEL AROUND THE WORLD IN MANY LANGUGES. So tell me why not FB & TWTR.",
"While FB certainly has the financial muscle to buy DIS, that would be a huge mistake for both companies as culturally they are about as far apart as you can get. If FB really wishes to diversify away from being a souped-up Bulletin Board System (BBS) that makes essentially all of its money by exploiting its users, violating their privacy at every turn, and selling them out to advertisers, they could consider leveraging their other core competency: building and operating hyperscale data centers. FB could easily launch a serious competitor to AMZN's AWS and Microsoft's Azure. DIS is going to need such a service and the only question is whether they realize this before or after they launch their streaming service next year.AWS and Azure are huge profit centers for AMZN and MSFT respectively, and a FB equivalent would give them a significant growth opportunity to fall back on as the ad gravy train starts to run out of steam. That's the only sort of partnership between FB and DIS that makes sense.",
"I would say a partnership isn't really necessary for Disney, they are more than capable of promoting their service even to those who use the internet for most of their media consumption.  Facebook is a much more plausible takeover candidate than Apple though. Apple wouldn't add much value to Disney, but Facebook could. Facebook has coders that could seriously speed up the build out and reduce the cost of Disney's streaming services and FB is already primarily an advertising and distribution company just like Disney.  Facebook would benefit from a much more diverse revenue stream and gain control over some of the most iconic brands/ characters/ franchises of all time... plus Hulu, so it does make sense from both perspectives. The combined company would be an absolute juggernaut though and I'm not sure how that would fly with regulators or advertisers in this environment.  If AT&T is getting scrutiny for trying to buy Time Warner, this would probably be dead in the water, but who knows?The other problem is Zuckerberg would have to stop his lawsuit to issue 2nd class shares and effectively give up absolute control of his company.  After the Fox merger Disney will be worth over $200B and while it is quite a bit smaller than FB it's still $200B worth of new shareholders that would require a vote and I'm not sure Zuck would do that.  I've always said Apple buying Disney makes no sense, but Facebook kind of does. It would be one hell of a company and it would give Google, Amazon, and Netflix some serious competition at a whole new level.  I don't see it happening, but Facebook is a much more natural acquirer than most of the other names people throw out there.  Facebook would almost certainly keep the Walt Disney name too, which means Facebook would buy Disney and become a subsidiary of the Walt Disney company, interesting to think about anyway.",
This is actually not a bad idea.  I own both stocks.  DIS will never get the eyeballs that FB has.  FB does not have the content that DIS has.Grant,
"Why turn your assets over to someone when you already have leverage and power to begin with!! All these articles around streaming ignore one MAJOR thing~Digital is making no one any money and has the so-called leader in digital in Debt with no viable profit to show for and overhead costs that would make any accountant sick!! So tired of hearing about Netflix whose losing business model proves why Wall-Street has become not about financial Strength and Viability of a firm but pure Fluff and Whimsy around losing prospects!! They got Dominoes Pizza at over 200 a share who is making less than Netflix and was not long ago out the door as a company with the same old lousy product! Disney has the dominant business model!! Why don't we see articles on Netflix not having any alternate industries to there name like owning Major Networks outright, Producing Top Notch Cinematic films, Outright ownership of Licenses, trademarks and properties that is far and away the world leader in making residuals from this, Parks that carry your brand directly to the masses on an interactive level!! Disney has already got themselves into Digital on a number of fronts, making available there networks and some media to many known digital providers like X-box, Dishes Sling, AT&T's Digital Direct and others as well as HULU which they plan to get a bigger stake in. Gosh Darn they have three of the top Marvel branded shows on Netflix and make more from the licensing fee's on them and a few other movies and cartoons leased out to Netflix than Netflix made all last year and plans to make all this year!! The fee's that Disney charges down the line to Netflix for any of its franchises is going to go up steeply!! And as soon as they get a hold of the Fox assets any further contracts around shows and films through them will increase dramatically if they are not pulled all-together!! Both ways Netflix becomes even more marginalized either paying through the nose for top name programming or losing them and being seen for the even more niche network that it is!! When Netflix advertises for new customers on the internet they place a banner showing known Feature films and cartoons from the big studios (many Disney and Fox), not any of their obscure shows that most of the populous could care less about, never heard of and if they did knows nothing of what they are about, Netflix does no advertising on cable television, unlike Curiosity Stream a documentary based digital service who does. So what computer and maybe magazine advertising they do shows the Major media assets that Netflix needs to attract new mainstream customers down the line! As outlined this will further squeeze their already spiraling in the red business model to epic proportions if they can hold onto them at all!! Disney can just sit back and watch them squirm while they with their vast content library from two Legendary studio's, licenses galore and well established TV production facilities are already in tow! These TV Studios pump out well known original shows presently which can be easily transferred over to digital as well as creating plenty of new, original ones with there creative outreach and secured brands and licenses!! Netflix owns practically nothing outright, no known TV programming, Films or Licenses of any note!! It's solely relying on overhead spending costs and debt accumulation to try keep itself recognized in a niche market producing original shows most of the world has no interest in seeing and paying for licensed material that has no profitability return and will forever keep them boxed in! If digital ever does go main-stream (pun intended) than What people will be seeking out is the best content-oriented, wide mass appeal, known major media, be it Television, Films, Cartoons, Specials and the like!! Even the ability to purchase cross over major sporting events and newly released films or other Disney owned properties for a one-time fee which you can conceive being put in the works!! IF Digital remains as it is a stagnant profit producer Disney can still lay claim to enough Nostalgia, Nerd and Fantasy seeker folks out there and those on the fence looking to go to digital with two major Studio Libraries and production capabilities staring them in the face! If Wall-Street is all based about future potentiality than Disney is the Company for that in Digital and all phases of the firm in there soon to be 100 year old history......Not Netflix whose future prospects in an already murky and tough business climate and industry is not going improve!!",
"Facebook requires its users to be 13+ years of age, and for good reason. Disney needs a streaming service that can easily and safely reach children.",
"Facebook users aren’t really the ‘pay for content’ type, it’s just not their business model",
I second that. Where do we start?,
The Fox acquisition will give Disney 60% Hulu ownership. Not sure why they'd want to use something else as their streaming platform. They may want to buy out Comcast and Time-Warner to make life simpler.,
that would kill the competition,
"I just can't see this happening. I just don't think Facebook brings enough to the table in the partnership. Disney is already an extremely well-known brand worldwide, as are its sub-brands like Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, etc. Disney doesn't need a platform like Facebook to promote its brand or content. What Disney brings to the table is the real product: the content. That product is the unique differentiating feature of the service. Facebook's network is valuable, but not unique. Disney can invest in and build a network, but Facebook can't make a Star Wars movie. In fact, by joining with Facebook, Disney would essentially be throwing away all the investments it has already made in developing its own streaming platform (like its BAMTech acquisition, and acquisition of controlling interest in Hulu through the Fox deal).For Facebook, the sort of deal that would make way more sense is to purchase a smaller content producer. Facebook's resources could take a company like Lionsgate to the next level, by providing it with vast international exposure for its content, and resources to produce bigger content projects. Lionsgate is also, conveniently, courting suitors who are interested in purchasing it, meaning that Facebook wouldn't face the same sort of resistance that it might if it tried a purchase of another studio who's board isn't interested in selling. Plus, since Lionsgate would cost about $7B to purchase outright, it wouldn't stretch Facebook's finances the way that an acquisition of a studio like Disney would (Disney's market cap is about $160B).",

Kroger either already has the OTS system or something similar, or KR will duplicate the OTS to KR’s advantage and to have integrated functionality with KR’s computer systems.  KR has deeper pockets than Whole Foods, although Amazon may beef up Whole Foods computer R&D in the future.  The perceived Amazon threat isn’t a reality, that’s a take-away for KR investors.  Whole Foods is weak at the moment, while KR has added organic products to their stores.  Whole Foods may lose customer loyalty and KR may benefit.  Whole Foods is pressuring vendors for steep discounts, up to 5%, if the sales are more than $300,000.  KR may be able to follow suit and negotiate higher shelf prices for large sales-volume customers, too.  Bullish for KR.     “Order-to-shelf, or OTS, is a tightly controlled system designed to streamline and track product purchases, displays, storage, and sales.

What if the wife says, “Can you pick up a loaf of bread and a gallon of milk on the way home from work, please dear?”  Is the husband supposed to walk across a football field sized parking lot at a Walmart, then into a store the size of an indoor soccer field, when he could park within 10 yards of a Kroger store entrance and walk the same distance inside the Kroger store, pay at the self serve checkout and be on his way home in a 3 minute pit stop?  If price were the only thing, then 7-11 stores, with higher prices would not be in business.  And shopping on the internet, maybe it’s nice to do some people watching inside the grocery store once a week, as well as try a free food sample they're giving away on Saturdays…hey, a person might want to buy the product just taste sampled, and we do, buy it sometimes, too.   I call BS on the market commentators, with their analysis and visions.   What their BS is, though, is it their ‘spin’ to try and support their own profitable investment – nothing more.

"I'm wondering if the market is getting oversold.  Is every Tom, Dick and Harry short the market?  Is every hedge fund on Earth short the market?  Can this ever-so-easy profit making by shorting, 'a no brainer' thing, with all the chaos worldwide, and especially in Washington DC, well is this simple concept of shorting getting like student loans?  Fun to borrow those shares and see a big new balance in your account, just like student loans.  But, they're loans.  And loans have to be repaid.  It is red and almost no green on trading screens today for every sector and I imagine shorters are cheering their brain power.  I can imagine them telling their buddies, 'Hey, just short KR and everything.  It's so easy to make money shorting.' In a way, it is like the Tech Trade.  Everybody piled into Tech.  Everything else went down.  Overcrowded Tech trade.  Overcrowded 'short everything else trade.'  At some point companies will buy their own shares.  Like KR.  KR is waiting for a bottom, too.  The reversal can and will come.  Back to the upside.  Wednesday, probably, is when the reversal happens.  After the scary Jerome H Powell of the FOMC speaks and turns out to be not-so-scary, but a reasonable guy, after-all.    With that many over-confident shorters out there, the market can recover losses quickly.  Unless the sky really is falling....",

"Home Delivery will add profit to grocers’ bottom lines.There is a roughly $10 delivery fee for groceries.  In almost all major metropolitan areas, a grocery store is within 5 miles or less.  (In my neighborhood, 3 major grocery stores a within one mile of my house, including a Walmart grocery out let – without the Walmart retail goods.) Therefore, it will be profitable for Walmart to deliver. Profits on the groceries, maybe a slim profit margin. Profit on the delivery, a larger profit margin than the groceries themselves.  What the news stories failed to investigate is whether Walmart and the delivery service have a revenue sharing agreement. Shuttling groceries between a store and a home, at say 2.5 miles each direction, 5 miles round trip, is under 10 minutes, including traffic control devices.  $60 an hour, gasoline cost about 1 - 2 gallons, minimum wage, and that leaves a very healthy profit.  IRS counts about $0.60 or so for vehicle use, so, $18, which includes gasoline and the profit mark-up is double the actual cost. Therefore, the journalism is sensationalized by spinning the story as “a fight.”  Everything, every day is a fight then, if you call competition “a fight.”Fact is, home delivery of groceries will ADD profits for Walmart, Kroger, Amazon, etc.  Having a partner for the service just streamlines the capital outlay and administrative burden on Walmart, Kroger and Amazon.  Until otherwise proven, I conclude that Walmart and all others will take about $2.50 for additional profit for each delivery, sharing the profit equally with Uber or any other delivery service.  Business is in business to make profit.  Walmart expands home delivery in fight with AmazonBy Nandita BoseReutershttp://reut.rs/2FA8z23",
The grocery business is dead. Online ordering and delivery will compress margins and competition will force everybody to lower prices more and more and more till there are no margins left. And companies like Amazon can sell Whole Foods items for very low margins because their stock goes up in revenues not income.There will be forced consolidation in the grocery business and all the groceries will be taken over by internet retailers. Grocery is dead. Dead. Imagine the cost for KR to hire personal shoppers to prepare all the delivery orders. It will be more like a warehouse and less of a shopping experience. Amazon changed the game. It’s never coming back. Anybody who argues with me is either over 70 or too ignorant to see change when the writing is on the wall right in front of them. KR is dead money for 20+ years.,

"I am going to pay close attention to March 19th, when Whole Foods (owned by Amazon) has their meeting with Whole Foods vendors.  CNBC broke the story: CNBC story (3/11/2018)""Whole Foods calls meeting with key vendors as tensions flare""http://cnb.cx/2tBwUip Amazon charges vendors, of course, and has various models for charging sellers of products. It sounds like Whole Foods may begin charging vendors for grocery store shelf space.  If that happens, then I anticipate that Kroger would follow suit.  That's how airlines do it, that's how price wars or price increases take effect.  If it is decided by Whole Foods and Amazon to go this route, then the entire ""too competitive to make a profit"" weather pattern will break cloud cover and bright blue skies will greet the grocery business, for a change. Keep your eyeballs peeled for what Whole Foods does, because that can change sentiment in the grocery store sector in a heartbeat. FWIWKR back to $30 in 2 weeks for this reason?

"""In all, this business has demonstrated a better-than-average ability to grow the top-line and has recently experienced a significant recovery in margins as well.""I completely agree!  The recent CC was filled with positive forward leaning info...Too much to rehash.  The run up today is probably because Ex-Dividend day is tomorrow.

My doubling target is $73, may or may not sell then.I posted this before, but these two CC questions are the only things that could be considered items of concern, or things to watch for going forward:#1, Costumer Acquisition Costs were asked to be broken down between Online and B&M:Michelle Gass,""Great question, and I'm really encouraged and excited about all the work that Greg and his team are doing to drive greater analytics on the business, as Kevin mentioned earlier. He mentioned in his commentary earlier that we are making a significant shift into digital. That is all based on the sophisticated modeling that Greg and his team are doing around ROI, and so we anticipate that, over time, our new customer acquisition will, that cost will come down. And in fact, we're already seeing that. We're seeing the impact grow and we're seeing the cost decrease. So we believe that's a fantastic formula going forward, and that translates into both stores and into our online business.""***My take: This good question was not clearly answered. However, overall it is not going to change the bottom line knowing the differences. And the team is LASER focused on using tech to improve ALL aspects of the business including costs. Would like to hear this Q asked again next CC.#2, Did the stores integrated with Amazon bring more foot traffic and provide higher comps then the other stores?:Kevin Mansell,""While I appreciate your interest in probing more deeply on Amazon, Paul, to be totally frank with you and direct, there's really nothing more to add than what I gave during the scripted comments. It's just literally too early, and I think, you've been in this business long enough to appreciate the fact to try to draw conclusions out of a holiday period when we had so many other massive initiatives in place would end up coming to potentially a different – an incorrect answer.  So you'll hear when we are more confident about being able to isolate that impact in these stores, how we feel about each of the little individual pieces. So there's really nothing more to say on Amazon. I want to make sure you know we're very optimistic. We feel very positive. There's nothing we're seeing that doesn't make us believe that it's just another idea for us to drive traffic.""***My Take: Not much to see here, the answer makes sense to me....HOWEVER, some investors and analysts can't seem to function without Amazon saying, 'it's OK to get out of bed and start your day'.Aldi over WF is a complete nothing burger.

Unfortunately, the share price has steadily dropped from $7 at Jan 2017 FDA approval to now trade at $0.38 cents, and is facing a looming bankruptcy due to not meeting onerous loan covenants that Gary and his team agreed to.

"Some very important remarks:Investors shouldn't focus on the ""income before taxes"" metric like the author does as it contains very material one-time gains, both for Q4 and for the full year 2017.Instead, investors should focus on the underlying performance of the company's business as evidenced by gross margins and ""income from operations"".Q4 gross margins at the middle of the provided preliminary range were just shy of 15%, another noticeable step down from the 19% achieved in Q3. As a result, despite the material revenue increase, Q4 gross profit came in lower than in Q3.At the middle of the provided preliminary range, gross profit for Q4 was $11.8 million, down 13% from Q3. Even when assuming opex to have remained flat at $9.2 million qoq income from operations would be down by as much as 40% to just $2.6 million but I would expect the final number to be considerably lower given that the company has already warned about the need for higher R&D investments last quarter.Going forward, margins should benefit from the recent deconsolidation of Ganzhou Highpower but revenues will also be lower by a meaningful amount. Stripping out the deconsolidated low-margin business, yoy top line growth was actually just 20%.I would urge investors to wait for the company's final Q4 and full year results and initial guidance for FY2018 to better assess the situation at Highpower.From the preliminary results, Q4 looks like a rather poor quarter with higher revenues mostly derived from the now deconsolidated low-margin (7%) Ganzhou Highpower business. Income from operations will be, by far, the weakest number in the entire FY2017.So don't get misleaded by the company's financial engineering and rather focus on the underlying business performance which has worsened considerably during Q4.",
Thanks Michael - I've been looking for a play in the lithium battery space and this just might be it.,
Great article and thanks for the update!The market's valuation of HPJ is mind-boggling. Most other renewable energy or clean technology companies have 10-20x the valuation of HPJ despite showing slower growth and being much weaker financially. I hate how the market seems to punish stocks that are growing rapidly yet actually have a P/E ratio because the company has positive earnings. I bet that the valuation for HPJ would be higher if it didn't even have a PE ratio,

I see NFLX getting to 40 billion (70% haircut). To understand the craziness in valuation, just look at CBS and its attempt to take over Viacom for ~12 billion in stock. So NFLX is worth 10X+ Viacom? I would also add that if NFLX is worth 140 Billion and Viacom a mere 12 billion, why wouldn't NFLX swoop down and buy Viacom? The reason is - no one would accept NFLX stock as the stock price is in a bubble.",

This time I'll thank the short Gods of timing (timing is everything) and plan to stand on the sidelines (however difficult that may be to do).",
Talk of FAANGs and rotational shifts is for the guys on TV with the nice hairdos.  Why sell a stock that you believe will triple over the next 3-5 years.  Certainly not because somebody in a Hermes tie tells you it's subject to rotational shift...,
"Or check back today. Who cares what a stock does on one particular day?To yellowpage- I have no plans to applaud myself in one year as I will be out of my short position by then. I keep saying - NFLX is a great company that is extremely overvalued. Once it get its haircut (25%-50%), it will be fine. I may be applauding myself in one year on TSLA though. The 'jump the shark' moment occurred yesterday when the TSLA board granted Musk 3.2 billion  in options (potentially worth 50 billion). What an egregious example of Silicon Valley excess. I know he doesn't pay himself a salary (big deal - he gets all other perks), but that is ridiculous. Heck if Musk is worth 3.2 billion, Hastings should demand 10 billion. Shows what a bubble we are in.A rotational shift from FAANGS is in progress. This is not a two week phenomenon - it will last for a very long time.

"Seeing as most of the positive and negative points are being Made from a USA context, I think it would be worth a stock guru  analysising netflix from an international perspective. here are some ideas for such an article.( this post is about looking at subs and making money from Netflix shares. I do talk about left wing and progressive content)1) Internationally cord cutting is not a phenomenon.  Mostly because there is not cord to cut. Generally internationals have never had access to good cable. due to regulation. Also subscribers can’t understand why adverts play on cable TV.2) regulation - Netflix jumps over social democratic and national regulation ( ie national content regulations). how does netflix work with regulators?3) state/national tv, often high quality, leftish and intellectually Interesting, is prized and valued in the French Anglo German world. The usa generally does not value national TV. In the Anglo and French world, we were raised on the idea of alternative and interesting content which is non commercial and ad free. most of our state programs are progressive, arty and left wing. 4) how does Netflix get into China, Russia, Asia, Cuba. Can Netflix get huge subs in Cold War 2.0?5) how much will Netflix spend on key international content? What shows will it develop for each key market. more German shows? More Korean shows?Where is the growth for subs in the world?6) will Netflix buy content from state TV . For example the French offer some wonderful tv series. and then there’s Nordic crime which is huge in my country.7)The crossover . will international content cross over to USA audiences. are Netflix subscribers in the USA ready to look beyond USA centric tv?",
"You make a very valid point that I cannot contest. But I maintain that once there are fifty streaming services, each with its own percentage of appealing content, directed at one or more demographics, NFLX's position will be weakened each time these other services succeed. And yes, while I agree pay-for-view has gone nowhere, I see something in-between materializing. This actually is my fundamental point. And this breeds great uncertainty with NFLX's business model.We shall see, but thanks for a good rebuttal. We shall see.",
You are making a good point. But I am not sold on the subscription model either. This is my point. I believe there are many uncertainties and these are not factored in.,
"Reed Hastings has been highly successful for four primary reasons:1) His management philosophy is unique, incredibly effective, and has resulted in a ""can do""  company.2) His early vision that latency improvements in streaming would create the opportunity to deliver content via the internet has paid off big time.3) NFLX is as much, if not more, a technology company as it is entertainment. Hastings has an impressive technology pedigree, and this helped NFLX realize his vision.4) NFLX is the big fish in a relatively young and fragmented space. The quality of content, brand identification, etc. has given it first mover advantage, and its subscription model has proven to deliver value with pricing power that thus far that appears to be inelastic.Wow, what a quadfecta! But there's the rub. I have not heard anyone talk about what the disruption possibilities could be in five years when there is an order of magnitude more players. Will a subscription model hold up? I see a lot of risk it will not. Instead I see more of a pay-per-view model. Think of logging into a service that displays fifty streaming services. You want Black Panther from DIS? You pay for it. You heard about a really good NFLX Sixty-Minutes segment? You pay for it. You want to listen to Obama on NFLX? You pay for it.In addition to the plethora of services, think of the content that one will be able to choose from. Truly a renaissance in entertainment delivered digitally. Will NFLX be the ""king of content""? NO!! It may in one year, but others will be king on others. This is because NFLX is not selling widgets, it is selling art!!!Developing revenue models is a useless task if one doesn't fully know what the business model(s) will look like. If there is uncertainty, probabilities of success are assigned (just like a promising drug that is in trial). What probabilities are being assigned by many analysts that the subscription model will work for NFLX in five years? 100%. And as many have contended, their models are overly optimistic even if you buy into the subscription model.This is my bear case for NFLX. Is it a short? It will be. But doing so in the midst of momentum driven by the biggest investment players in the world is a bad bet. Better to trade it (long and short) based on the latest bull bear news (analysts upgrades/downgrades articles that are either hype or FUD. etc.). Then wait for a catalyst. No crystal ball here, only to say it will happen when one least expects it. One catalyst might be ""FAANG-fatigue"". The FAANGS have been behaving rather strangely in the last week. Something to watch, although could just be a temporary pause.NFLX is not going away, it will just come to earth.",

Welcome back Mr. Huneycutt. It's been a long time I haven't had the pleasure to read your articles.,
"Netflix stock, like all stocks, is priced at a level which represents a tug-of-war between the optimists and the pessimists.  What makes it a little different from most other stocks is that the optimists have difficulty understanding the pessimists’ thinking, and vice versa.  Just take a look at the comments ahead of this one!  The pessimists think Netflix is selling movies online, and that the opportunities for doing this are running out.  The optimists think Netflix has captured the lead position in offering commercial-free video entertainment at a very low price, giving huge future potential – both for expanding the range of the video products and for increasing the price substantially.  Here’s why I think the optimists are right, and that Netflix is a bargain at its present price ($319).  A large portion of the viewing population don’t want to pay their cable company for hundreds of channels they never watch.  And they’re annoyed by paying with real money for the channels, and then paying with their precious time to be forced to endure 10 minutes (or more) of brainless advertising each hour.  Viewers under the age of 25 are particularly conscious of their time and money being sapped in this way.  By using Netflix for shows and movies, and internet-based websites for current news and information, they can – and are in their millions – replacing traditional bundled cable offerings with bare internet plus Netflix.  Overall monthly costs drop from $100+ to $50 or less.  More money to spend on smartphone usage.  But also more subscriber cash available for “skinny” internet-based TV offerings, which Netflix is sure to be offering and expanding soon.  Their three current plans (basic $7.99, standard $10.99, premium $13.99) can clearly be broadened and enhanced in a variety of dimensions.  And the emergence of low-cost 5G fixed-wireless internet offerings, over the next three or four years, may further boost the range, economics and attractiveness of Netflix’s offerings.These changes in viewing patterns are taking place very quickly – much quicker than some of the “pessimists” seem to think. And, by the way, there are very profound implications on the stock valuations of companies dependent on ad revenues, particularly TV stations and networks, and also, of course, on the profitability of the cable companies.",
"Between global subscriber growth, increased monthly subscription fees over time, (which are sure to occur and be accepted because of the quality content and usability of the platform, compared to competitors), and new per content pricing options for both recorded and live events, NFLX has substantial room to grow.  Buy while you can....",
Really good analysis. Many thanks. I expect you underestimate the future pricing prower. What is with additional revenue streams like secondary licence fees for the own productions?,
You should bet everything you have against NFLX since your 100% confident. Very few things are out there that fits Never and Always..,
"If I had an overvalued currency(NFLX STOCK) I would buy something of value with it.Just a thought.FCN, CFP(r)",
It is starting feel a little like the late 1990's were valuation didn't matter until it eventually did. NFLX and AMZN being the poster boys.,
"Netflix has a crazy valuation because the market is stupid. However, the thing bears completely fail to consider, time and time again, is that the market is not going to stop being stupid tomorrow. People don't just wake up and realize things. That's not how it works.Historically, markets continue being stupid until catastrophe strikes. Banks had CRAZY valuations until the financial crisis woke everyone up. Valeant had a crazy valuation until the government scandal woke everyone up. In September of 2015 it was worth $240 a share. In November of 2015 it was worth $85 a share. What changed? Literally nothing. The balance sheet was the same both months. The income statement was the same both months. It just took a public reckoning for the market to stop being stupid.That's why I don't short Netflix, and I don't short Amazon, or any of these other crazy stocks. If millions of people are wrong about Netflix today, why on earth would you expect that millions of people will suddenly be right about Netflix a month from now? Unless you have an actual catalyst you are predicting, it's just not happening.",

I always admire your posts but I’ve seen you mention a billion subscribers a couple of times and I’m wondering whether you really think this is a possibility? 1.5bn households in the world so 2 in every 3 households? Ive spent most of the last five years in India. The idea that the people I spend my time with would rather watch Netflix than eat feels a little far-fetched. I also can’t see any way that China’s one-party state would allow an American company to utterly dominate the streaming market there and protect it from piracy.,

"The idea that NFLX will build a 'competitive moat' through investment in content is yet another dubious assumption. Just look at the number of movie studios that have gone bankrupt because despite having a huge inventory of content, they had a couple of bad creative years. Once the competition is in full play, consumers will be very sensitive to the quality of current content, and I believe brand loyalty will be fickle. I acknowledge NFLX is producing quite diverse content, and that may shield them to some extent. But a lot of that content is sort of mundane so I am not sure what the value perception will be. I indeed like the nature shows, and it is really cool to see an exotic lizard eating an insect on the newer TV's, but I'm not sure that is going to keep me as a subscriber if DIS, AMZN, or some other competitor have the hot series and/or movies.",
Re International:1. 1/2 of the potential target is too poor for Netflix or does not have proper infrastructure (fast internet)2. Another 1/2 does not need Netflix as they can download pirated copies of everything.So. International boils down to:1. Western Europe + Japan/S.

"Put your money where your mouth is, boy.",
"This analysis is deeply flawed.1. OP put a $15 price in 10 years for upside. US pay TV users pay an average of $103 per month. Netflix doesn't do Sports and News and even if you take half of that off, why can't Netflix charge $50 in 10 years since it has no ads. and has vastly superior content compared to what you can get on TV, especially when these TV networks have practically died at that point? It takes time to get to $50, but you can expect Netflix to increase price not by $1 next time around. Higher price means higher margin, and OP's 20% optimistic case will be totally conservative. Netflix is increasing 300 base points per year on profit margin for this year and last year. It can definitely continue, and it will explode when content budget no longer increases.2. Content cost will increase because producers want a bigger piece of pie. This is totally wrong. You only need to pay more than the next bidder to get the show you want. If Amazon pays 100M and Netflix pays 110M Netflix get it most of the time, and it doesn't matter Netflix has 1B subscribers or 100M. Also, the highly contested bids nowadays are for top producers and top talents, at a time competition is probably at its highest. But A, Netflix is able to find foreign talents, who else in Hollywood was competing for ""Dark""? No one. B, Netflix is able to find new producers and talents and turn it to a hit. Who were Duffer brother and the kids before Stranger Things? C, Netflix gets all the way upstream and locks up top producers like Shonda, freezes price and starves others. D. Who is gonna bid against Netflix when they are dead? How many media M&A news are you seeing these days? Their content libraries and talents and up for fire sale soon, for gods' sake. How can the content price go up when there are so many sellers and only 2-4 buyers? Netflix will disrupt Hollywood and many people will lose their jobs, and they'll beg Netflix for a job.",

"Had been a nflx bear for many years. Never owned the stock. Bought some otm puts (a sane way to short) a few years back which expired worthless. About a year ago the light dawned. And have made significant money riding the wave up with otm call options. Here is what changed my mind. Netflix has, by far, the best success rate with shows they produce. Although they have never made 'The Black Panther' they churn out profitable minor hits one after the other like no studio has ever managed. What secret do these relative neophytes know that has eluded every movie and tv production studio since the dawn of time? Technology. Software. Algorithms.  When you stream any show over their network they know who you are, all your demographics, how much of the show you watched, whether you watched it all the way through, whether you binge watched an entire series, what you thought of the show and so forth. This data that they collect that no one else has is not used so much to choose shows for you in their idiot if you liked this you'll love that algorithm, but rather to decide exactly and precisely which shows to produce next.And it works. Like magic. So rather than ask what is the total possible subscriber market, ask what is the total possible market for streaming video and how much they can eventually charge when they have a monopoly on content. Yes, there are many other content producers now. But none have the easy access to such a mass audience and none are as good at producing hits.  And none have the critical data.  It is very possible that one day nflx will totally dominate the movie/video entertainment industry -- will have something close to a monopoly. And how much is that worth? 500 billion? One trillion? Maybe more.Not that this is going to happen. But it could. Which is why there is still a strong bull case and netflix is not a bubble.

NFLX starts at Rs 500 in India (roughly $8). That's wayyyyyyy more costly than most Indian households can afford. It's not even in the same room. 500 a month is more expensive than the expensive Dish TVs in India. There's no way NFLX will be making it big in India at that price point.,

"Hi,Have a couple of questions.Have you used the content costs on a cash basis in your financial analysis?Also the argument is based on the assumption that the content costs will continue to go up majorly due to higher share of the pie being taken away by the content creators, since the validity of your viewpoint is based on the above assumption and conflicting evidence available it would be great if you could elaborate a bit further on this.As Per the investor relations website ""For any given future period, we estimate revenue, and decide what we want to spend, and how much margin we want in that period. Competitive pressures in bidding for content would lead us to have slightly less content than we would otherwise, rather than overspending""This shows that the increased cash outflows are a result of planned program and not because of the creators charging a higher amount for the same content. Also, the company had close to 1000 hours of original content in 2017 as compared to 600 hours in 2016, and has plans to have 700 original shows and 80 original movies in 2018. Which shows that there has been a  rise in the amount of content with the rising spend and not just more money being charged by content creators. What could explain lower TOTAL CONTENT addition if there is any(not sure about it ) could be because of a higher proportion of original content(the company aims to reach 50% of its total content to be original).  Original and exclusive content should economically more expensive than the content that is available on other mediums as well, but is the one that can allow it to charge a premium for its service and create a competitive advantage by keeping the viewers hooked. http://read.bi/2GqMCj6http://bit.ly/2kWcoE6Also, as per your analysis the (optimistically) the company will be able to generate a revenue of  $ 72 billion if I do a reverse calculation based on your margin assumption of 20% and 15-25-30% of costs(based on your 2017 numbers) other than the content costs, in that case the content costs would work out to approximately $36-40 billion (50-55%), looks a bit stretched if we compare that to 8 billion spent on non sports content by Disney. Also, in assuming that the content costs will continue to balloon we are assuming that netflix will need to add, completely new content for the new subscribers in the international and domestic market, we are ignoring that there will be any synergies (As per this BBC article ""India now claims to be the world's second-largest English-speaking country. The most reliable estimate is around 10% of its population or 125 million people, second only to the US and expected to quadruple in the next decade."" http://bbc.in/2GozVWc). Content  already being created can appeal to a larger population, hence bringing down the content cost per subscriber or produce more content per subscriber, as Netflix expands outside of US.The Argument above in your analysis IF TRUE could be a real risk however there is some contradictory evidence available, could you please clarify your position on the same?",
"""The Netflix Bubble""- You mean like how Amazon has been in a bubble for the past 20 years LOL? $$$",
Good article - I also have long thought that Netflix was overvalued. When you look at their balance sheet they are spending so much cash just to keep the business going - it is simply unsustainable. Content costs are too high. With that being said everytime I look at their price it is higher than previous so I have been on the wrong side of this trade for quite some time.,
Netflix should correct to roughly 280 by year end,
The P/E ratio alone should tell you everything you need to know----------------------...That mindset is deadly to your stock picking....whether NFLX or anything else.,
"Here is my issue with Netflix:Content OVERLOADI remember a couple of years ago Netflix did a study that found if users didn't find something to watch within something like 60 seconds of logging into Netflix they exited the service. How do you build a long term business when your users will only give you 60 seconds to suggest something that will they will enjoy being entertained by? Their answer, better algorithms to suggest content and rolling out whole seasons of shows at once so you can Netflix and Chill (meaning binge watch). But then what? What happens after the user has spent 10 hours watching Stranger Things over two days? The answer . . . MORE CONTENT. More content to the point that now Netflix is flooded with so many new offerings I can't find anything to watch.Ask yourself this, when was the last time you were on Netflix and thought to yourself ""there is so much random crap on here I can't decide what to watch."" It happens almost every time I log onto Netflix. The byproduct? I watch the same old things over and over. And the new content I have watched? Noticeably lower budget and lower quality than the Netflix staples like House of Cards and Stranger Things, which is a big turn off.For this reason alone I am negative on Netflix. I don't think they will survive in their current state.  Their current stock price is a ridiculous over inflation of value. The P/E ratio alone should tell you everything you need to know (225!). If I owned any shares, which I don't, I'd have been out yesterday.",
"Another contributor on Seeking Alpha pointed to Disney as the long-term future of entertainment.  To be honest, I don't see any flaws in this logic.  Netflix creates original programming.  So dose Disney.  Netflix provides streaming.  So can several other providers.  The barrier to entry does not look that high.",
"I do like your analysis. The subscriber numbers are realistic. Even if netflix charges 15 dollars or 20 dollars it would still be cheaper or affordable. Content developers in US are trying to get a bigger part of the pie and there will be a competition. Netflix has its own content. And almost anyone can create content. So there will be competition in content development. As the world goes more flat, people will watch content from other parts of the world. A show from Australia or UK will be viewed in US. I sold amazon at 300 dollars thinking it was overpriced, because amazon cannot penetrate as much in foreign market. That was 5 years back. AMZN did not penetrate as much in foreign market but it grew 5 times in 5 years. We can call it bubble. But I would hold it. I am not selling my NFLX so soon. I sold AAPL in 2013 as well. Netflix is just grabbing the market. The next phases of profit might come from 1) increasing the subscriber price 2) lowering the content price. If they grab a huge market-share its possible. In US cable companies are providing internet and their power comes from that physical connection. Outside US cable companies do not have monopoly. NFLX will be more dominating.",
"""If we assume NFLX generates $72 billion in revenue in 2027 with 15% profit margins, its net income would be about $10.8 billion.

"Interesting points. I invested in Netflix late, but still have an 80% profit right now. I'm trying to decide if I should keep the shares or take the profit now so this analysis is a great starting point.The major factor here seems to be the content costs. Content can have value for decades. That is exactly why Disney, Marvel, etc are potential competitors -- they invested in content. Actually most of the competitive content is owned by Disney!Remember that it took over a decade for Marvel's movies to build up to the dominant force they are today. And that's just one brand. Star Wars has been building value decade after decade. Netflix has been building up a number of names, some successful and some not, over the last 7 years. If you looked at Star Wars in 1984 would you have predicted what it is today?Netflix may keep spending on content creation but any given movie or TV show only has to be produced once. Their business model may allow them to eat the media industry (except for Disney). And that could turn out to be quite profitable.Another way to look at this is that Netfilx is generating a lot of cashflow and investing it heavily into content that will have a long life. Once they do they open up more possibilities. With licensed content all they can do is charge a subscription fee. With their own content they have a much wider range of monetization options. All they've done so far is raise the price from $8 to $11. There could be much more to come.Traditional media companies put a lot of restrictions on international distribution. They seem to miss more opportunities than they take. Netflix recognizes that when they do domestic promotion they also create international demand and they can turn that into paying customers. Remember China and India together are only about 1/3 of the world's population.In the context of customers going from $100+/month spent on cable to $11/month on Netflix (and maybe another $10-20 on Disney's service) there is a lot of room for value extraction. If cable is replaced entirely by online alternatives live sports will be a big part of the package. Netflix doesn't do that, and it could capture 25 - 50% of the previous cable costs. That still leaves a lot for movies and TV.If Netflix creates more and more valuable content, and they monetize internationally, and they find ways to get more value out of their customers, and a large part of their spending is a one-time cost, the result could be different from your projections.I'll do some more analysis but as a starting point I'm quite comfortable that there could be a lot of upside in the stock from today's prices. Of course one of the reasons I bought the shares was so I would notice if it got a lot cheaper along the way. I'd love to see that happen.",
"Totally agree, but then again I thought this at half the current valuation. Goes to show you can’t apply rational valuation analysis to what you admit is an irrational bubble.",
"Hey Jake,Great article with a number of great points. However, I think at 500MM subscribers there is going to be a point of margin expansion as content expenses will shrink as a % of revenue. Right now in the US markets we have a 60% contribution margin. 10 years out the average revenue per user should be about 200/year or more and the question is will NFLX be spending more than 40B on content yearly. Content expenses will likely slow relative to revenue growth with margin expansion. I think 15% is probably too low, but what is the future margin? What happens if the op margin grows to 25-30% or higher?",
"Thing is NF has been public for around 16 years with 8 or 10 of those seeing ever increasing capital gains. Throw in a couple splits along the way and it just keeps rising.  They had the vision to disrupt the DVD business but didn't rest on their laurels waiting on what comes next.  Turns out THEY came next by streaming B movies and old TV shows which nobody knew they wanted.  It took several years for the other multi media conglomerates to figure out NF was on to something and begin fighting back with competing services yet most of them are currently far behind the ball.  But then NF does another pivot with original content and striking their own deals with stars and producers getting ahead of the game once again.  I was there at the beginning when NF transitioned from DVD to streaming, and I had the first Roku box replete with all its bugs and quirks and all you could stream was The Thing from the Swamp or some such nonsense.  I wish I'd had the vision then to see the future and purchase shares holding until today, but all along the way there has been a strong bear thesis that made sense so I never bought in.  Until finally a couple years ago I did.  And even though it might have become 'wildly over valued' and the bear case still makes sense on some level, the company just keeps hitting on all cylinders and they have visionary leaders at the helm.  It could eventually fail but so could any of my other investments.  I believe in the story here and am holding but will always remember to never fall in love.",
"People are already being very selective in the services they subscribe to. Netflix dominates, followed by Amazon and Hulu at much lower levels (to the extent Amazon's video subscribers can be extracted out of their larger Prime membership). When Disney comes on board, they will factor in, but Hulu will most likely be absorbed into their service long term. Apple could be a factor.Subscribers want value: big libraries, buzzy titles. It's hard to ramp up a gargantuan library that suits all tastes and there's only so much buzz to go around. Either you have a preexisting brand like Star Wars or you luck out after trying dozens of times with a Stranger Things.This will result in a very high cutoff point for success - subscribers might opt for 2-3 services per household but they all want the same big names. So a few big global names will prosper and the rest will fade out or survive by being highly specialized (anime, Christian content, etc.) Time rather than cost will be the limiting factor. At about $10 each, I could afford more services than Netflix and Amazon. I just wouldn't have time to watch so why bother?Netflix has nothing to worry about. CBS and HBO should be worried, though. And what the hell does Comcast think they are doing? Maybe content to just become an ISP and sell off NBC, SyFy, etc to one of the big tech winners? Fox being bought by Disney is just the start.",
"Agree to your point to some extent. But have you considered the price increase over the next 10 years ? Say the average price increase from 12 to 15, the net income could increase by 30%.",
"Dear Mr. Huneycutt,An excellent and clear-eyed analysis. Mechanically sound and internally consistent. My only two pieces of advice would be to more closely look at two of your keystones in the structure you've built.First, regarding market penetration, you review the Netflix subscriber base relative to the number of households. You say ""There's no realistic case where a large number of households are subscribing to NFLX twice."" I would assert that ""no realistic case"" is a little too strong. I know that the plural of ""anecdote"" is not ""evidence"", yet anecdotally I see many households with multiple subscriptions (including my own -- imagine my surprise when I discovered my then 15 year old was earning and paying for their own subscription -- don't underestimate the paranoia of the teenage mind regarding parental oversight of streaming history and the utility of having to *gasp* -work- for control of their own entertainment choices, but I digress). I would suggest that a better estimate of a global total addressable market would be 50 or 60% of the total number of internet connected, streaming capable devices. That's over a half billion active devices if you only look at Apple products.Second, regarding content cost and the Disney juggernaut, I would put more thought into exactly how much content Netflix is producing itself. My sense of your perspective is that you view ""Content Library Additions"" as an expense item. It's really an asset, which is then amortized. A clue to how this is actually improving Netflix's financial footing despite the burning of cash can be seen in the FCF statement. Note that the net streaming library value continues to grow even as the contributions and amortization of that library grow even faster. Unlike our water reservoirs in California, the content reservoir at Netflix continues to fill up, providing more and more ""entertainment pressure"" (if I can put forth an awful metaphor). Disney is probably a fair fight when you take their size, capitalization and human experience in producing content and put it up against the mountains of data Netflix has alongside the ever-learning content team and what they are producing.As I said, you have produced a sound and internally consistent analysis. I would merely double-check a couple of your assumptions.",

"I have to say, their recent subscriber growth did not surprise me. It seems you can't open a car door without someone offering you a free Netflix subscription. Google (ironically) gave me 6 months of Netflix free with my Chromebook. At the same time, T-Mobile is offering free Netflix with their One plan. Why did I say Google's ""gift"" was ironic? Well we recently cut the chord, by dropping our cable TV service and we switched to YouTube TV, which is $40/month for live TV of the major networks, and ESPN, our local sports network, CNN, Fox News, and a bunch of other channels. Plus unlimited cloud-based DVR.I wonder if Netflix gets a full subscriber payment for these ""free"" services or if they give a discount to Google and T-Mobile?Oh, and FWIW, we have watched a grand total of 2 movies on Netflix in the 3 months we've had the service. The movie selection is pretty pathetic.",
"The barometer I like to use is its valuation compared to Disney. These two companies are nearly at parity which is baffling to me. I find it very difficult to believe that Netflix is worth more than ABC, Star Wars, Pixar, theme parks, Marvel, Disney animation, ESPN and soon to be Fox assets combined. Simply amazing to me. Disney posted ~$56 billion in revenue in FY2018 with a decent dividend and share buyback program.",
"Great article and well reasoned arguments. One thing to consider is the leverage in the operating cash flows (Net Income + Depreciation). This was close to $7B on revenues of $11.6B (almost 65%).Content investments are about $8B currently but should top out eventually (they are already the largest content spenders in the media world today).So, if you have 65% operating cash margins on $70B in revenues, you get about $45B in cash flow.If content investments top out at $20B, you are looking at $25B in free cash flow in 2027. That could support a $400B - $500B valuation (which would be significantly higher than what it is now).Even if you take a more moderate case of revenue at $50B and apply the same math, you get a $15B free cash flow which could support a $300B valuation (doubling from today or 7% CAGR in 10 years).I do believe there are significant risks to the above numbers and hence sitting on the sidelines.....I think Tesla may be a better example of a stock in bubble territory - would like to know your views on that....",

Welcome back Jake! Been missing your great articles here on SeekingAlpha,
"Jake H.you got my ""follow"".the sobering reality is that insanely priced NFLX hasplenty of company!!!TSLA, AMZN, NVDA just to pick a few.REALITY will eventually strike.",
"It's easy to call NFLX a bubble. Bears have been doing this for most of the past decade, and its good to see that the ""I'd rather be right than rich"" crowd are still around. The only sure sign of a bubble is when bears throw in the towel, as they did in 1999-2000. So real bubbles can only be seen to have been such in retrospect. You cannot isolate NFLX from the overall secular trend that is driving it. That trend is the death of linear TV on a global basis, which has been the dominant home entertainment model for the past 65 years, and the convergence of all media into streaming. The fact that these sort of articles never even look at, let alone analyze, this larger trend is telling. Global media represents a $2 trillion dollar (and growing) per year market, which is why DIS is (belatedly) preparing to move in the NFLX direction. Try recalculating assuming 1 billion global subscribers in 10 years with those in developed nations paying pretty much the same for an assortment of streaming services as they spend on cable TV today. That's where things are heading, and is why NFLX continues to barbecue bears on a regular basis. For those who don't understand a stock and the business behind it, the best advice is simply to stay away from it and focus on opportunities within one's comfort zone.",
"I heard this exact argument countless time. You could say it was true when the stock was $60, $80, $90, $100, $120, $150, $200, etc due to its absurd valuation at each point. It's the same argument against Amazon stock as well.Right now, investors only care about subscribers growth. As long as they can keep growing, the stock will continue to work unless we hit a recession on the broader marker. You can't value a growth company base on P/E ratio alone. They are growing by definition; re-deploying profits to increase market shares. P/S ratio or PEG ratio is a much better measurement for a growth stock.",

Nvidia is a absurd bubble compare to Netflix bubble. Excellent Article.,
Bubble?  We've heard this before. This is a flotation stock which cannot be priced on valuation.  It is continually expanding and adding subscribers. I think someone is attempting to push the price down in order to jump in.,

"I absolutely agree that distribution will be key. However, it is estimated that demand will vastly exceed supply for the first two years, and that every gram grown will be able to be sold. After that, the massive new facilities will be online, and supply will vastly exceed domestic demand.  This is when margins will get crushed and things will get tricky for smaller LP's. But, in the short term, I would not write off the smaller LP's that in many cases produce a superior product. You may want to consider the comparison to the beer market. Mass-produced, low-quality beers like Budweiser have seen smaller, high-quality craft brewers steal massive amounts of market share. Large greenhouses sound impressive, but tend to produce an inferior product, compared to smaller, indoor grows. the smaller LP's will likely be able to get at least some footing in the market, due to the supply shortages. I believe too much attention is being given to the initial supply contracts, given the fact that Canadians will likely consume all of the cannabis that is for sale domestically. The winners in this race will likely be the growers that consistently produce the highest quality, and are able to create strong brands. The large LP's may find that their mass-produced greenhouse weed is not as popular as they had hoped, and, just like the larger breweries, will be forced to buy their smaller competitors to maintain market share. Just some thoughts. Thanks, I really enjoy your articles. I also write about the cannabis sector, and previously owned cannabis businesses before going into finance.

"Great article, Dave. I own ABEV shares and enjoyed learning more about the company. Thank you for taking the time to share your knowledge.",
"Thanks Dave for quoting me!What is amazing with ABI is that if you are an European investor, the 5 years chart is different as the share now has been well below EUR 100 and downwards for the last couple of years. The fact that ABI is legally a Belgian company is presently to the advantage of the company dividend-wise! Indeed, the dividend is declared in EUR but accounted for in the books in USD. Therefore, even though the dividend is officially flat at 3.6 EUR, the actual cash out in USD has increased significantly when the USD has weaken. I do agree with one comment that ABI is not keen to reduce its dividend when what happens if the USD decreased to 1.40 or 1.5 as it was compared to EUR 10 years ago? ABI has limited revenues in EUR and its profit from Continental Europe is small. So a decrease of USD has not much positive impact in the global profitability of ABI but a big one on its dividend payment.As mentioned by Dave, ABI distributes more dividend than earnings. It is ok for the time being but not with a too weak USD.I have both ABI (including some from SAB-Miller merger) and Ambev and would buy the former if it goes below 80 EUR. Ambev is good buy below 7 USD to play both Brazil recovery and emerging markets.",

It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. Their top ""Brazilian"" managers are educated on Ivy league schools right here in the good ol' USA. 3G has only put in practice a management philosophy according to practices used in the US.

"Looks like the acquisition of Altona Mining will go through after the affirmative shareholder vote which is very good news given the commercial terms of the transaction. On the leverage: 1) Copper Mountain has and will continue to de-lever via the in-place FCF in order to gear up again for the investment program on the Altona-property. 2) This is a ""friends & family""-financing in conjunction with the off-take agreement with and equity investment by Mitsubishi. The conditions are so good that you would never want to repay it.... 3) The overriding concern for Mitsubishi likely is the continued supply of product under the off-take agreement rather than the repayment of the debt. Therefore, a solution would likely be found in case there ever was a problem under the financing that would protect the integrity of the off-take agreement and Mitsubishi's equity in the transaction. 4) If Copper Mountain would be able to replicate this financing structure for the investment program into the Altona-property, this would be a huge positive for the shareholders of the combined entity.",

The only reason i am writing this is because when i was a newbie reading comments helped me to avoid pitfalls... so i owe it to do so ... as a former owner of stocks of copper mountain the reason i sold the stocks which i had and was a very big chunk if my portfolio was this... the company is wayyy leveraged i.e meaning it needs 5 years of current prices to deleverage significantly provided things go as plan with the new mine... is this a lot of leverage u ask? It is if you think that the current demand in china is not sustainable for the next 5 years... dived deep in the fundamentals and i could not find a single reason why china would keep this extraordinary demand ... and i dont spook easily ... so with heavy heart i sold as i dont believe china can keep this crazy demand for 5 years to go ... what about ev will u say? Would you want to find out if china reduces demand what happens to the stock ? So for this reason i sold when they took the extra leverage for the new mine i sold,

Germany gets 27%  of its total energy from renewables - and it's a cloudy country - and has had (sunny windy days where more than 80% was renewable!)Also, subsidies are offered for virtually all of our energy needs, so that argument carries no water.

Now it seems that the big oil-companies are increasing their capex.Within 2017 DO itself predicted for the end of 2021 an increase in ulta-deepwater-dayrates.Which should mean that the jack-up Segment will have recovered in 2020.The average noble fleet-age should be around 10 years.No newbuilds !At least 500 Mio. USD in cash and due to the restructuring of dept not much dept to repay before 2021.And up to January 2023 an undrawn revolver of more than 1 Billion $.   Backlog is around 3 Billion $.The only catch seems to be a pending law-suit. -Which is (seekingalpha-disscuss... not expected to get lost or lead to an expensive sattlement for noble. Remark: Ensco purchased atwood for round 1/3 of their book-value -one year ago (weeker-oil-environment) with close to zero backlog and a 50% drawn revolver. The book-value of noble is around 24$/share. Due to the young fleet - how much of impairments is to expect in the future?? Maybe they will report a loss for the next  3 years? So, maybe a book-value of 20$ in 2021?DO is payed with around 70% of their book-value now(and a lot of older units; which could contend a higher risk of impairments?).=》 So why should I agree to sell my shares (except for a far higher price) ?But I may be wrong.

I think it’s important when discussing M&A with Diamond to remember the Loews factor (I.e Tisch Family). What set of circumstances would have to occur for Loews Corp. to be willing to either dilute its shares and or give up majority control? I don’t have these answers but I think it’s important to remember the power structure (control) and who are the institutional investors in a company. IMHO... Have a great day everyone.,
"As correctly stated by Vladimir Zernov above, Diamond Offshore won't and actually can't buy Noble Corp. due to change of control provisions governing the company's bonds. Any deal involving Noble Corp. would enable the company's bondholders to put back their notes to the company at 101% of face value.Accordingly, Diamond Offshore (or any other potential acquirer) would have to come up with more than $4 billion in cash to address this issue. Given the state of the industry, this would be an insane move.That said, no company in the entire industry, not even Borr, does have the financial strength to deal with Noble's debt, particularly as the capital markets would not provide the refinancing for such a move.Lastly, even without the debt refinancing issue, Diamond Offshore would be unlikely to buy Noble given the fleet composition. Diamond Offshore has publicly stated that they are not looking to buy assets at current prices and instead laid out plans to potentially order a new drillship design if they will be able to sign an acceptable contract with a customer.",

"VA,Agree that DO will eventually have to add new rigs to high grade their fleet.  However, the question is will they do it by the ""floating factory"" (fancy name for NB's) they talk so much about, or by buying existing equipment - buying one off rigs or a another competitor like NE.In their most recent CC, DO stated they did not see the UDW market recovering until 2021-25.  They then went on to discuss the fact that probably 60 6th generation rigs would need to come out of the market, and by then many cold stacked rigs would have been stacked 5-6 years.  Those rigs would need substantial capital to reactivate.  So at least on their CC, it seemed that DO would prefer to wait and either build new rigs or add other rigs as we get closer to that time frame.NE is certainly of a size that DO could acquire.  However, in looking at their fleet, NE has 3-4 semis that need to be retired.  Why buy NE now with several modern rigs stacked, have to issue new debt to pay off NE's debt, and be faced with retiring more rigs?  Also DO has eliminated it's entire JU fleet and is now purely a floater company.  Do they want to get back into the JU market, which they would with a NE acquisition?""Noble is currently trading at a significant lower price-to-book value than DO and other offshore drillers, once again, making it a perfect acquisition target.""If you can calculate a ""true book value"" today on any OSD, you are a better man than I.  Take three identical 6th gen. drill ships.  One is working, one just rolled off contract and is warm stacked, and the 3rd has been cold stacked for 3 years.  They may be identical with the same capabilities, but we both know the true values of each of those DS's are substantially different.  Any potential acquirer is going to look at the current condition of each ship and value accordingly.You may be correct that DO buys NE.  However, I would be surprised if it occurs soon.  And even if it did, how much will an owner of NE make, since part of any acquisition will entail stock of the acquiring company.  i.e.  How much did you make on the takeover of ATW by ESV?  As an ATW shareholder, you received 1.6 shares of ESV, which has gone down at least 15-20% since the merger was completed.",
"You posted an ""Average Floater Age"" graph of the DO rig fleet which is 2 years old. The current rig fleet's average age is 13 years and that includes the Ocean Scepter JU which is ""Held for Sale""I would suggest that you take a look at the most recent DO rig status report and update your data.",
It looks like we are time warping backwards.  A few years ago the subject of M&A was debated at length. This same subject was brought up and had a hearty debate. NE on the surface looks attractive with its $3 bil backlog but a huge problem stands as a gate to prevent any buyout of NE. Its massive debt that will come due on sale will prevent even the most dim witted CEO from buying. I have posted several times NE is now in the show me phase as oil has climbed. In not too long many of its legacy contracts will roll off and if not replaced with good profitable work this company will meet head-on in to it debt it slid ahead. I can agree on a token basis NE may look attractive to a CEO to purchase but its just a facade. Inside this company is hocked to the gills and perceived outward value is just not there. In the end DO astute management would never pull the trigger on NE and if they had any compulsion to do so they would have done it when rates were lower and before NE renegotiated their debt. Its fun to what-if though.,

I think the company will continue to have a quick growth rate, and the last secondary did not seem to press share price down much.My worry is that the stock is already very expensive -- even if we assume the growth rate the company is projecting, it's maybe 7x 2019's revenues....and it's a type of business that has to spend a consistent amount for each incremental dollar of revenue because of the required payments to the consulting docs.My brother is managing partner of a primary care practice and it seems like a natural progress for tele-visits to become widely adopted as a fundamental choice of care. I'm still unsure how much teledoc pays to their physicians, and let's say it's $35....and that buys either/both a mid-lower level doc and a reduced intensity session relative to in-office.

With the result that even though ARCC will be able to earn higher interest income on their floating rate investments but defaults might increase and also the market for reinvestment and new credit might dry up.

"China beverage trendsThis report says, ""Although, Coca-Cola has much higher share,"" Dibadj wrote. ""Moreover, recently, Pepsi is losing share to Coca-Cola especially since Pepsi sold the right to bottle its product to Tingyi.""  But, Pepsi has a sale for cash on the books, whereas FIZZ doesn’t. Coca-Cola is playing the long game.  http://bit.ly/2GDgsEI These are some quotes from another article.  It highlights what FIZZ is doing right and what FIZZ is doing wrong, if the assumption is made that Chinese consumers mirror US consumers.  Making that same assumption, the report also highlights the long-running Seeking Alpha sore-point debate about LaCroix missing out on C-store sales.  In China, C-store sales are one of the two fast growing metrics, the other being on-line sales.  http://bit.ly/2En9VrI quotes from article:Indeed, China’s consumers are continuing to show a preference for healthy goods or for a better-quality life, a phenomenon enabled by higher average incomes. The value growth for packaged water was 17.3%, Premium segments now outpace mass segments. This is especially true in packaged water … further evidence that Chinese consumers will pay for healthy goods or to improve their lifestyle.In fact, e-commerce accounted for more than three-fourths of the total growth in value in 2016. Without the boost from online, FMCG value would have inched up by less than 1% in 2016.Only seven categories grew in penetration—yogurt, makeup, shampoo, conditioner, facial tissue, packaged water and diapers—all of them health- and hygiene-related.Leading companies such as Weiquan and Nongfu introduced new juice ranges—healthy “Body Management’’ juice and not-from-concentrate (NFC) juice, respectively. Both companies enjoyed over 20% growth in 2015–16.While most FMCG categories are continuously premiumizing, only a few are able to increase penetration at the same time. Among those categories: packaged water, shampoo, conditioner, yogurt and makeup. Packaged water benefits from the National Food Safety Standard of Natural Mineral Water, which led to the introduction (and heavy marketing investment) of new product ranges, most of them premium brands. A common strategy for improving volume at the expense of average selling prices is to offer products on promotion.Six of those provinces experienced FMCG growth in excess of 7% in 2016: …  This resulted from an increase in number of households, fueled in part by higher economic growth.Our sixth annual study of Chinese shopper behavior for home consumption shows the continuing shifts in retailing. Online and convenience store channels maintain strong momentum, while big-box retailers lose steam (see Figure 11). Unsurprisingly, e-commerce led the pack, growing by more than 52.0%. Online now represents 7.0% of total FMCG sales. Convenience stores, steadily serving the needs of busy urban consumers, grew by 7.4%, adding such new incentives as in-store pickup of products bought online from other retailers. The hypermarkets that once defined robust growth declined by 2.0%, and the once-flourishing super or mini format grew by 2.0%, about the same rate as inflation. While their share is slowly shrinking, those two formats still account for more than half of the FMCG market. In increasing numbers, China’s consumers are looking for convenience, either online or offline. As a consequence, they’re making fewer and fewer trips to hypermarkets. Contrast the hypermarket situation with that of online sales in the world’s biggest online marketplace. It’s no secret that digital sales continue to skyrocket in China. The phenomenon gets particularly interesting when you look at some of the ways the growth is happening.",
"“Master Kong, owned by Tingyi Holdings, is one of China's biggest food & drink brands, as well as the local licensee for Pepsi.”  So, that’s how Pepsi does it.  FIZZ could too.  http://bit.ly/2JmZMPw Let’s say FIZZ wants to limit expenses.  Suppose FIZZ offers reciprocity and approaches a major Chinese or Japanese bottler and says, “National Beverage proposes that Tingyi Holdings, or similar/equivalent competitor, makes a deal. National Beverage will bottle and distribute your brand in the US and you bottle and distribute our brand in China (Japan, etc.).  Profit sharing.”There are many US Chinatowns, the most famous being in San Francisco.  Naturally, that’s where the marketing begins for famous Chinese soft drinks, for which Chinese-Americans may already have a craving.   Ask the Asian bottler how best to roll-out a marketing plan for LaCroix.    http://bit.ly/2EkmOmj  There are ways to enter into China or Japan.  How did Coca-Cola do it? Pepsi?   China has online shopping and marketing with Alibaba and JD.com, with delivery service.  The market is just too big to ignore.  I am guessing an American beverage might become a status symbol, the same as Chinese silks and teas are legendary status symbols that wealthy Americans pamper themselves with.  Marketing an image.  For example, if you scroll down to Chinese candy, you will learn that Chinese don’t like or want chocolate and prefer dried fruit, because it is healthier.  See Number “5. Chocolate is bad, fruit is good”  http://bit.ly/2GBliSY   If Confucius says, “Coca-Cola is bad, LaCroix is good,” then, “You’ve done a great marketing job LaCroix.”  LaCroix naturally fits Chinese culture. Healthy is the marketing concept.   Ask for an appointment to talk to Confucius.  Get Confucius backing LaCroix and ""The rest is easy!""",
"maybe LaCroix needs to release ""dandelion wine"" sparkling wines.",
"I'd really like it if Nick and FIZZ are making contingency plans for LaCroix to enter China. Contingent on more freedom of trade, or a reciprocal trade agreement.  As in, line up a Chinese bottler who purifies water in accordance with LaCroix specs, uses LaCroix ingredients and does distribution inside China.  At least start out in one major city in China.  I think Chinese love American products and like America and Americans, but maybe have reservations about US policies.  Same as everywhere. New York Times Bestselling Author Thomas Perry said in his fictional work, ""The Old Man,"" that sometimes Americans travelling abroad tell people they're Canadian, so they don't have to hear ranting about US policies.  Mr. Perry said, 'Everyone loves Canadians.'  Which is off-topic, but coming full-circle, there is a potentially huge market for LaCroix in China.  If a free-trade agreement is reached.  Rather, when a free-trade agreement is reached.  Millennials in China probably would like to be health conscious, drink LaCroix, and feel good about drinking a healthy carbonated beverage.  Kit-Kat Bars are a huge hit in Japan, so strong trends do happen.  LaCroix in China!!!    http://bit.ly/2uRQCaw",

"Kroger was handing out free samples of Lemon-Lime sparkling water Saturday to grocery shoppers.  The Lemon-Lime sample tasted more like Sprite or 7-Up, and had a strong flavor.  So, I looked up the ingredients.  Kroger’s Lemon-Lime sparkling water has 10 mg sodium.  http://bit.ly/2Gt49Xv Reddit says, “In the ingredients I now realize it lists sucralose.” “Sucralose = Splenda” http://bit.ly/2GnUi9c  OK, so what I see is that consumers really do look at ingredients.  The Kroger Black Cherry Sparkling Water has a really low rating by Fooducate.com:Ingredients. carbonated water, citric acid, potassium citrate, potassium benzoate (preservative), malic acid, natural and artificial flavor, sucralose, acesulfame potassium neotame. http://bit.ly/2Gud7Du http://bit.ly/2Gn5OS8 LaCroix always will have competitors, but when it comes to LaCroix, the loyal LaCroix consumers may try or investigate a competitor's offering, but return to LaCroix, for health benefits.  And the more they explore around and find sucralose/Splenda, sodium and other chemicals in competitive offerings, the sooner the LaCroix crowd will see that it isn’t even worth it to do any more ‘investigating’ competitive offerings and will be ever more loyal to LaCroix and their own health.  Some of Kroger’s competitive offering have less and some have more undesirable ingredients, but “What’s the point?”  LaCroix doesn’t have any of the unhealthy ingredients.  So, LaCroix it is, and they’ll tell everybody on social media, too.  At parties, at family gathering, just small talk about why they like LaCroix.  It is a new generation of consumers out there and they are health conscious and drinking LaCroix.  The social media LaCroix consumers create and the social media they consume is huge and powerful.  What does “Powerful” mean, in “Social Media” context?  Like Parkland's David Hogg to McCain: 'Why do you take so much money from the NRA?' https://usat.ly/2GscqLd   http://bit.ly/2Gnwtyu Or how a high school kid can get advertisers to stop  Fox News show host Laura Ingraham in her tracks and maybe get her fired. “Fox's Ingraham taking vacation as advertisers flee amid controversy,”  https://reut.rs/2IjWPOb   http://bit.ly/2GnR4ma  Make no mistake about it.  Social media is powerful and shapes people’s thinking.  LaCroix has excellent social media talk, from a huge number of people.  For a long time running, now.",
"Anyone know if Rite Aide was recently added to the list of locations where LaCroix is available for purchase?  When was Rite Aide added?

Sweeping the country.  As with all corrections, they have a finite lifespan, then share prices go back up again.  The next earnings season begins in earnest when the big banks like Citigroup Inc. report earnings on 04/13/2018 before market open.  I recall that the end-of-quarter, two weeks before the next earnings reporting season is often weak for stock prices, then when earnings begin and beat estimates, the stock market climbs back up again.  Financial media is perplexed to find a 'new catalyst' for share prices to increase.  And the algo's think what happens in the next second or the next minute is all that matters, and algo's often use the indexes in determining whether to move share prices up or down for the day.  That's why I am not an algo.  Often it is a quarterly re-balancing by institutional investors that cause these market moves.  But then, voila, they've finished re-balancing and that's that.  The FOMC hasn't yet raised rates to 3.25%, but the market is acting like they did, even if it may take 2 more years to happen, if it even happens.  The FOMC may realize they're tipping consumer sentiment, business capital investment sentiment, and political election odds in a way that is going to put themselves directly at-fault and in deep trouble with Congress and tone down their bullshit. Pretty quickly, too.  A good grilling on Capital Hill should show them how much heat can come to bear upon them.  A good flogging for the Central Bank at the hands of Congressmen should cause a re-thinking of how the Fed should loosen up their interference with the economy and not cause a recession, based upon their theories. A real recession, deep and long, based upon a textbook they read 50 years ago.  Hold onto your hat, a gust of wind is trying to sweep it off your head right now.

"the only number I really focus on here is growth rate, for all of these confusing reasons you just mentioned",
"$358,051,522 LaCroix sales for “January and February, 2018”.  BevNET.com Staff Feb. 19, 2018 at 11:44 am  Source IRI, through 12/3/2017, 52 weeks.http://bit.ly/2DULly4 This channel check, “Channel Check: What’s Hot and What’s Not” is somewhat misleading because the numbers “don’t add up”.  (1st ) If it’s 2 months, then three month would be approximately 1.5x or $537,000,000 and that is almost double what FIZZ’s entire quarter is supposed to be. So, these have to be what the retailer charges and not FIZZ’s wholesale to retailer prices. (2nd) If the IRI Source is “through 12/3/2017” then that is not “January and February 2018”, and is actually October and November, 2017.  Well, we already have the “numbers” from the past earnings report.  So, I suppose I could do some math and figure out the ratio of the LaCroix category vs. the Shasta and store brand contract bottling business mix for FIZZ.  And, with the addition of Walgreens Drug Stores locations added after Labor Day 2017, I had hoped to see significantly higher growth rates for FIZZ and LaCroix due to the very high number of Walgreens Drug Store locations adding significantly more point of sale locations for LaCroix.So, “the data is inconclusive” unless numbers are crunched to ascertain the Shasta division’s flat sales rates.  We don’t have that info.  If Shasta has been flat sales for a year or more, then 50% added onto LaCroix begins to compound better, more in favor of the Bulls.  It could be that Shasta is not 50%, but is 30% of total FIZZ business, in which case, 50% growth of LaCroix, year after year, adds more than 25% to FIZZ’s EPS and Revenue growth.  Eventually, fundamentals catch up to share price.  If they’re selling more LaCroix and the 50% YoY growth rate trend continues, then earnings and revenue will be larger than 25% and will begin heading towards 30% and then 35%.

"Let’s ask the question – “At what point does FIZZ decide to do what Michael Dell did with Dell Computers, and buy back all their non-insider shares?”  At a PE of 25, then 1/25 = 4% Well, 25% of the shares are non-insider owned. 4% per year Buy-Back takes 6 years and 3 months to them buy all.  PE 30, 7.5 years, PE 20, 5 years. So, using this chart showing investor behavior, vis-à-vis, what PE is assigned given the 10 Year yield, we can say that if the FOMC raises rates (tightens) 3 times a year for 2 years, then that adds 1.5%, roughly, to the 10 Year yield.  2.8% to 2.95% add 1.5% is 4.3% to 4.45% on the 10 Year.  Looking at the chart, we see that the historical market PE average for 4.3% to 4.45% is roughly PE 20.  http://bit.ly/2jSDmx2 I think FIZZ is smart and is waiting for the PE to drop, due to the 10 Year’s increasing yield, and then they’ll just buy back the company, and the insiders will own 100%.  It is less costly to run a business if SEC compliance isn’t required. Greater profits for the insiders.   Take FIZZ private.  DELL did it.  The company has issued Preferred shares before. They have credit lines.  They could still grow without being a publicly traded company.  Cash cow.",
"FIZZ Factors Some excerpts from the 2017 FIZZ Annual Report and other data sources.Weather:FIZZ’s Annual Report 2017 said weather is as a sales factor. During hotter weather people drink more, but during colder weather people drink less.  For example, on page 18, “Beverage sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer and warmer months. As a result, our operating results from one fiscal quarter to the next may not be comparable.”  http://bit.ly/2DyVS1V La Nina (the opposite of El Nino) made the Pacific Ocean cooler this winter, but La Nina is gone already.  Spring and summer 2018 are expected to be hotter than normal as shown on this weather map.   http://wxch.nl/2GBkY38FIZZ should have warmer weather as a tailwind for sales going forward in 2018.  Weather also hindered deliveries in the most recent quarter.  That won’t happen again, at least not until next winter, if at all in 2018.  If spring and summer 2018 are warmer than normal, FIZZ should have higher beverage consumption per consumer. Accounting Principles /Sales:Sales Incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales.“We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets. Sales incentives are accrued over the period of benefit or expected sales volume. When the incentive is paid in advance, the aggregate incentive is recorded as a prepaid and amortized over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume. The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts.”  Page 21, 2017 Annual Report: http://bit.ly/2DyVS1V  49% CAGR, April 28, 2012 through April 29, 2017.FIZZ has had a bumpy ride for share price, but it has been a high performance investment for long term investors.The five-year FIZZ cumulative returns of an investment of $100 cash on April 28, 2012, assuming reinvestment of dividends, provided a compounded annual return of approximately 49% as of April 29, 2017.   $100 turned into $727.64, during that five year time period, according to FIZZ’s 2017 Annual Report, page 14, http://bit.ly/2DyVS1V  US 10-YR (US10Y:U.S.) headwind:2.06% (September 8, 2017) to 2.94% (February 21, 2018), back to 2.84% Friday, March 17, 2018, the U.S. 10 Year Treasury Note yield has been a headwind for PE ratios.  http://cnb.cx/2p4PgGn  Chart of S&P 500 P/E Ratio versus 10-Yr Treasury Interest Rates From 1957: http://bit.ly/2jSDmx2 There is an upcoming FOMC meeting this week, which will give the market a little more guidance on the direction of interest rates.  Wage inflation is still non-existent.  Geo-political and  D.C. political ‘musical chairs’, tariffs, trade war talk all over the globe, well, will the economy overheat, as was thought due to the tax cut?  Or will the FOMC leave investors with the idea that rate hikes will be gradual?  Will the FOMC say rate hikes could slow or could accelerate, but the trajectory is inconclusive right now, given this scenario of uncertainty?  It has been argued that with inflation unable to reach and hold 2% for such a long time, that the FOMC should wait until at least 2% inflation can hold and maybe hold a little over 2% for a while, before tightening.The 10 Year yield is important, but the biggest companies in the S&P 500 are high PE ratio hi-tech, mega-cap companies.  The thing is (a) everybody is convinced 3, maybe 4 rate hikes in 2018 and (b) the rapid yield increase in the 10 Year really clobbered the market: breadth has been negative, more 52 week lows than highs, for a while, and uneven participation in the index gains, with a few companies accounting for all the gains.  This doesn’t help investors, large or small, mom-and-pop investors or CALPERS, The California Public Employees' Retirement System.  Chaos, all around – not good.  Maybe things will settle down soon and investors might get some visibility.  So then, Is FIZZ a ‘sure thing’ to short?Insiders own 74.97% of FIZZ and always have.  http://bit.ly/2DzhsmP http://bit.ly/2GBYIpW Institutional FIZZ ownership is almost as high as the short interest.  http://bit.ly/2DzhsmP Short interest has been coming down, from over 3 million shares shorted at the end of November 2017, but otherwise up all throughout 2017.  http://bit.ly/2GFHDvr I’d conclude FIZZ is not a ‘sure thing’ to short.  FIZZ is a crowded short trade.  I also doubt FIZZ will have a 49% CAGR over the next five years, either.  I am confident FIZZ will be a bumpy ride, if you can hold on, that is.  Weather will help, the FOMC isn’t helping.  Politics can change on a dime or overnight.  FIZZ gives retailers incentives and is increasing the number of retailers all the time.  Tax reform helped.  Plus, minus, plus, minus, plus, minus…. No guarantees, not in this lifetime.  If a trade war ensues, then FIZZ has not much international exposure.  Aluminum tariffs will increase the production cost of FIZZ by $0.01 per can.  If a trade war causes recessionary data, then the FOMC could halt rate increases, slow them down or cut rates to stimulate the economy.  Just a lot of uncertainty out there on Wall Street, right now.  Interest Rates:“During Fiscal 2016, the Company repaid $10 million in borrowings under its credit facilities.

I was a little skeptical La Croix was a fad until researching how large the market is in Europe. La Croix says through their Instagram account they plan on being in different parts of Asia very soon. There’s obviously a lot more to La Croix and the other products of FIZZ but I think La Croix is here to stay and will continue to grow",
How well developed is LaCroix's social media marketing?,
"Very timely article.  Well done.  As a FIZZ shareholder, I am happy to hear that you consider Pepsi's bubly brand of sparkling water almost undrinkable. From a marketing perspective, I'm rather astonished at the incompetence of Pepsi and Coca Cola. Before bubly, the plan for both Coke and Pepsi was to launch a brand of sparkling water and use the same brand name as the bottled, filtered TAP WATER they sell to compete against real mineral water sold in bottles. I have an extremely low opinion of the brands Aquafina (pepsi) and Dasani (coke) for this reason.You think you're buying water from some spring. You expect that they are selling you mineral water. You read the label and you see something like: filtered from the public water supply of upstate NY.  LOL. Now let us go ahead and use the exact same brand name to launch sparkling water that will compete against LaCroix. LOL.  By launching a new brand of sparkling water, Pepsi seems to have caught their error and coke seems to still be clueless. However, even if bubly was a very tasty treat...they only offer 8 very common and one dimensional flavors. LaCroix has over 20 flavors of sparkling water and will sometimes combine two fruit flavors in one can to provide a very unique taste mix. Everybody says it's just water but the competition is light years behind LaCroix.",

"Good article, thanks.  The closed ""retail brands business"" refers to private label manufacturing.  Based on a Bamsec search the last time they referenced this business in any filing, other than a list of subsidiaries, was 2008, so that should give an idea of its importance.  Closure could be seen as a positive since manufacturing capacity tied to that business can be repurposed.",

"Last year I got to try sparkling Minute Maid and honestly, almost made me sell my DPS and PEP in favor of KO.  Right now they are all overpriced. DPS is sold and PEP is on the chopping block. FIZZ is ""relatively"" well-valued.  If the market or sector takes another 20% correction it may be a good bargain. I am willing to sell PEP but the only value FIZZ has over PEP now is the buyout option.  However why would PEP buy out FIZZ at 27x earnings when it can buy its own shares at 22x earnings?",
"The argumentation in this article makes a large error.I dismissed this product as just sweet water. Sure there is brand loyality. But who has brand loyality?People who never drank LaCroix will not have brand loyality for a brand they never drunk? And if you look at the revenue LaCroix makes, a lot of people never drank it. Therefore this entire moat is non existent and all other big players will have little resistence in offering their new products - backed by huge advertising budgets.I would consider going long on this stock onces it goes below the 20's in terms of p/e. Then the company does not need to grow any more and is all risk of growth priced in properly.",
"Good read - something that is underrated is that LaCroix frankly tastes better than the competitors. I've tried every flavor of the Dasani sparkling - it's ok, but across the board, it is inferior. I had a Bubly last night and found it almost undrinkable.",
"I posted this on another thread but wanted to bring it here as well:Here's an interesting topic to ponder, shelf space. Consider that cos. like PEP and KO pay literally $10,s of thousands of dollars for a linear foot and FIZZ has paid zero, yet FIZZ has taken shelf space from competitors since the product was released. Two primary reasons are that it sells faster and has a higher profit margin than those it's replacing, two factors every business understands very well. They've seen linear feet increase and endcaps appear (endcaps cost more). The only way PEP will get shelf space for Bubly is to sacrifice some they already have with other products (maybe only 24' of PEP down from 28') and their muscle, but if the product doesn't sell faster and be more profitable than FIZZ it'll revert back. I feel that initially Bubly will sell as most new products do, if only for curiosity, and that may well effect this qtr. for FIZZ, but at some point it's about taste and cost, 90% taste 10% cost (if I don't like it I won't drink even if free). So this will be an interesting qtr. and one to invest cautiously. I have a totally full posn in FIZZ, one I've accumulated over the last 12+ years, but if I were considering adding today, I'd buy some near the $$ calls and wait til next Monday when the June series are available, just long enough to get past next earnings release, then see what I wanted to do with real money. But I will watch shelf space for both FIZZ and Bubly for the next 6-8 weeks to help me determine what's actually transpiring",
Who are the most likely acquirers assuming Coke and Pepsi are out?,
Very good article.  I have a bubly vs LaCroix comparison for you guys that suspect that bubly is worthy competition for LaCroix. Here's a link to LaCroix flavors:http://bit.ly/2tGSHW0 The above article mentions 21 LaCroix flavors (I think they may have added a flavor or two since then).Here's the 8 bubly flavors:http://amzn.to/2GhiKWp Pepsi is not as god-awful in marketing as they used to be. They were using the same name for  their bottled filtered TAP WATER (aquafina) and for their sparkling water that was competing against LaCroix. This time they are using a new brand name that will not remind you of the disgusting Aquafina tap water they were selling to compete against bottled mineral water... but they are putting out eight fairly common flavors and LaCroix has so many more flavors and combines flavors in the same beverage.,
"People figure it out sooner or later.  Any energy drink is bad for you (just like 10 cups of coffee in one gulp), any fruit juice is sugar water (leads to Diabetes 2 and heart disease), and any flavored sparkling/non-sparkling water is also sugar water.  What is LaCroix?  Read the label.  If there is sustainable value, the Coke's would have bought them out long ago.  As it is, the Coke's are busy trying to rebrand their own problems.  Maybe when they fool the health-conscious Millenials again, they'll get around to crush FIZZ if they so desire.","At A 9-Month Low, National Beverage Looks Attractive Again"
"I own SMFG and MTU. Considering their substantial overseas (and for US investors, “domestic”) assets, their valuations are insanely underpriced.

"There's a WSJ article that quoted that Tesla has a financial risk ratio at 1.2.  (Anything below 1.8 is in financial distress and 1 translates to bankruptcy in 2 years).  I am glad the investor sentiments are coming around to put pressure on Tesla management to perform.  Structurally with the rise of Cobalt prices and Tesla not owning the battery supply chain, I don't think there's much Tesla can do to meet the profit targets on model 3's.  Look for Elon Musk to come up with another outrageous announcement (electric power rocket to Mars?) to distract investors during next review.",
"While Victor continues to be completely delusional, he has shown with this article some rare human quality: the ability to change his mind on a closely-held belief.  That not only redeems him as a rational homo sapiens, it also shows his professional opinions are worth being listened to. Congratulations Victor.I dont want to kick the man who is showing humility and honesty, but he also says it is ""normal"" for a financial writer to ""sugar-coat"" his thesis. No Victor, it is not ""normal"", but it is ""common"", and that is not the same.For example, Montana's excellent articles are not ""sugar-coated"" on the short side. You could at most accuse him of having blind spots for the long side, but everything he says is absolutely rational.And btw, we have now Adam Jonas, VA, and Victor willing to consider the dark side.

"ZMLGood ideas in theory, other than the fact that Tesla doesn't have any machines making machines, and their automation is exactly the same as every other automaker.Other than those minor quibbles, you absolutely nailed it. BTW I don't disagree that Elon would like to use his Earthbound factories to test out Marsbound tech. I just see zero evidence that anything has been produced, beyond sketches and daydreams.",
"I received the first part of a report about self-assembling production lines. It actually made me laugh because the idea is kind of absurd, but then I remembered what they are made for. At the same time, I started thinking Elon Musk's idea of moving to Mars and how everything depends on how advanced the manufacturing methods need to be here on Earth and on Mars. He is not kidding when he says robots are building robots, that's the way it will be. I have several factory automation engineering friends, they all repeat the same mantra for anybody who is willing to listen. ""Making cars, especially the model 3, is just an excuse to develop new manufacturing methods while making money with the product.""  Tell me about it, for them working on new projects is exciting because they get to build new factories and the customers who buy the factory products will finance their obsession. Elon Musk's obsession is clearly how to build tools for Mars, the rockets, tunnel boring machines, vehicles that don't need oxygen to operate, the power that comes from the Sun, the energy storage systems that don't need the power grid. All those would need to be made on Mars with highly automated Gigafactories that could be based on today's Model 3 production lines and can produce everything from toasters to houses.",

Kudos for a well-reasoned and reasonable Tesla article Victor.,
"Dear Victor, writing such a post requires an element of courage that deserves much praise. To that adds a comments section where such praise is generally expressed with elevation and unrestraint from both sides of the argument. A rare thing in the modern days of the fake news and anonymous bashing internet. This is the reason for a reader like me - not an investor - to regularly return to this website.By bringing together both enthusiasts and sceptics, you show that a consensus has built around Tesla's financial predicament: the company can not follow on the current path for much longer. Although you do not refer to it, the recent unexpected step down of the chief accountant largely attests to this. Something rather substantial must change, and in a relatively short time frame.Considering the underlying sentiment and its key points, this article also stresses the idea that the main financing methods used by the company heretofore, at this moment pose significant risks. Be it a capital raise, a bond issue or a new product launch, none appears a safe option for the time being.What happens next is anyone's guess, but I doubt 2018 will go for Tesla as the years before, even if I see bankruptcy as a remote hypothesis.",

My M3 compares very closely with those on the BMW's and Porsches I owned prior to permanently jumping ship to Tesla over 4 years ago.

"Victor, a fair article from a long-time Tesla bull. You are not the only Tesla bull to rein in expectations a bit -- Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's Tesla booster recently sent out a cautioning note about Tesla. He even advised taking some profits (gasp, selling)   if TSLA rises a little.I believe Tesla stock will reverse course within the next year or two. The valuation of $58 billion is simply way out of whack given Tesla's past, current and future financials. The current valuation might work for a high-margin software company with minimal capital needs, the ability to scale-up seamlessly and some sort of patent protection. Tesla is basically a car manufacturer -- it is in a cyclical, capital-intensive, intensely competitive, low-margin industry. Tesla may be worth a bit more due to its early EV status, but competition is coming, sales of its two most expensive models are slowing, and it has not shown an ability to make Model 3's efficiently or profitably. The valuation is too high even if Tesla corrects  Model 3 roll-out issues.",

"I think you're right about some of your criticism, and wrong about others.In the end, yes, Tesla is in danger of not meeting even their relaxed targets, and that's not good.  Yes, they will have a pretty poor result in Q1But first of all, the Bloomberg ""reporting"" is more of a mathematical artifact than a real-time estimate of weekly production.  They way they generate that figure is subject to fairly wild swings up and down.  It was not as high as 1052/week production, nor as low as 655 (or whatever the exact numbers were).  They just happened to get a bunch of VIN reports one week which made the average look higher, and then didn't the next week which made it look lower.  I would certainly not read that much into it, other than the fact that on average, it is MUCH lower than where they should be at this point.Second, I wouldn't put much weight into the Munro report either.  If you've followed those Autoline videos, you get the sense that they are basically a propaganda channel, likely funded by GM or Ford, whose sole purpose is to discredit Tesla.  Let's just say they have credibility issues, at least in my book.That's certainly not to say that Tesla doesn't have build quality and production rate issues.  They do.  I just feel the issues are somewhere in between the ""non-existent"" level that the fanboys preach, and the ""doom and gloom"" level touted by the bulls and the two sources mentioned.",

Does it ever irk you that the company never discloses bad news as it happens or at least soon after it happens, only after the fact when they need to explain away other bad data - such as weekly production dropping by almost 40%?  Remember the battery issues in Q2 and Q3 and how those weren't disclosed until a month or 2 later?  The reason I cannot be a Tesla bull is because no matter how great the cars might be, there is a big problem with integrity and transparency in the company's dealings.  Having been burned by other companies with the same issues, I am loathe to blindly accept what Tesla - especially Mr Musk - says at face value.  I hope you are seeing this as a wake-up call as well.

I am Unaffiliated and have been so for years.  As for a political solution and from a Behavioral  Economics point of view I think that a tightening of the Congressional divide or maybe even a flip will greatly improve Fannie and Freddie's chances.Mnuchin is not a friend of Fannie and Freddie !!,
"I agree, having old Mel Watt retire and a fresh new guy, with Steven Mnuchin, things will workout just fine. By early 2019, FNMA and FMCC should have a little capital built up,(if they allowing them to keep retaining there earnings)I hate the waiting but current events seem to be looking towards that kind of outcome.God Bless America",
Inside Mortgage Finance article says FNMA&FMCC reform by legislation unlikely to happen this year. Which will leave it up to FHFA& Treasury next year according to the article.  Jeb Hensarling  is claiming to be working on a solution but he hates the GSEs so it will probably be DOA. He will be gone with Corker at the end of the congressional term.

Glen first thank you for all of your work If they just put the stock back out with the government owning 79 percent and end the sweeps would that not raise the price to at least 150 per share and generate 200 billion over  a 10 year period for the government,
"i think the real problem was not fnma or fmcc,  The government must have a mortgage loan program control department , just to supervise the new mortgage loan programs,  we don't want more 100% no income no asset programs or the 4 option program with negative amortization,  created by Contrywide and Washington Mutual banks,  and any other program with easy money,  if you don't have control, with or with out fnma and fmcc you will see the same movie another time",
Correction:  Yes - Fannie not Fanny....,
Just because we are all here talking....  :)   When Trump was early on the campaign trail in 2016 and into 2017 he discussed how unfair it was that Fanny and Freddie were taken over and the profits were swept over to the gov...He received big applause from the crowd as to how if elected he would right all the wrongs that big government was doing....Fast forward to today....   NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE....  I thought Trump would have dealt with this months ago....  Forward also to today:  Larry Kudlow....   If he gets in... what is to say he will not just 'do nothing' for a while like Trump-...?   and I like where Trump is... I believe he will eventually do the right thing....   It is just taking to darn long...    Its like they are holding this to the end....  (end of what I do not know - but yes...  to the end)...,

"Thanks Glen for your tireless efforts. I just listened to the entire recording. When the judges respond to the gov't BS about the FHFA's broad powers with ""Powers as CONSERVATOR"" with it's clear historical meaning and statutory requirements to preserve and conserve the assets, it's epic. Like calling BS on the whole thing...At least some of the judges out there do ""get it"".",
"Mnuchin is afraid, very, very afraid. A restoration of FNMA would blow a very bid hole in the government budget and have serious political repercussions for the mid-term elections and beyond. The court may force his hand.",
"So Trump is considering Larry Kudlow to replace Cohen. That is interesting to me because Kudlow has stated publicly several times how FNMA&FMCC shareholders were ""screwed"" badly. If that happens it can only help FNMA shareholders since Cohen is more in favor of ""Wallstreet TBTF Globalism"" on trade. Kudlow is a freetrader also but is not as strident about his  opinions, that is he can compromise unlike Cohen. Now with Tillerson & Cohen out there will be people that more reflect Trump's mindset, maybe.   Kudlow does reflect a certain honesty about his opinions.",
They’re expanding and are not going anywhere,
"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac started 2018 with more workers on their payrolls than the year prior, according to an analysis of 10-K reports filed by the two government-sponsored enterprises.At Jan. 31, 2018, Fannie reported a staff of 7,200 workers compared to 7,000 in February of last year. However, two years ago its head count was higher at 7,300. Of the new reading, Fannie noted the total includes full- and part-timers and employees on leave.Freddie had a staff of 6,144 full-timers and 41 part-timers at Feb. 1, 2018. A year earlier the head count was 5,959 full-timers and 45 PTs. And in February 2016 it employed 5,416 full times and 46 PTs.Both companies have been solidly profitable since earlier in the decade, though changes implemented under the Trump tax overhaul caused them to book one-time charges and net losses for the fourth quarter of 2017.Both are likely to return to profitability in the first quarter of 2018. For more information, see the Friday edition of Inside The GSEs.",
I truly believe that as soon as the stock moves up by .50  you should buy buy buy. That’s when you will know that a deal has been made .... and I will be buying all I can afford We’re close to victory,
Mnuchin has changed his proposed dates to have Housing Reformed settled three times at my latest count.   That should tell us something.  He is either fudging or has no idea how to solve this problem or proceed.,
"Remember how powerful Hilary Clinton was as Secretary of StateTrump, with a back hand just up and fires his Secretary of State Rex    WowTrump has the power and is not afraid to use it.  He and Mnuchin have express theredesire to ""reform"" the GSEs. Seems like everyday something new is going on, and I am sure one of these daysan announcement will be made concerning these companies. It will be swift andfast  (ask Rex)",
"No one can every overlook the greed of man and with all the players vying for a piece of Fannie, Freddie and the GSE, some will eventually begin to turn on each other. If you asked me we saw part of that with Corker-Warner and Jeb Hensarling in each of their new proposals.   Peter Wallison will not be immune.  However, the Political and Financial tides are shifting in Washington.  Just ask Cohn and if we are luck Mnuchin as well.",
"Do the numbers! you will be convinced that the path is:1. Lift conservatorship; 2. Explicit guarantee; 3. Execution of warrants; 4. Selling of common in the open market; and, 5. Cashing in on 4.3 billion common shares at $67 per share, approximately, and then some! Be patient, listen to Warren! By the way, he could buy the entire lot at book value. Stay tuned!! If mortgage interest rates go up (at least 4 times in 2018, per Fed) old WB could quadruple his money and return to government 15% ( new CFIT beg. in 2018). WB could swap for more BAC common shares to avoid that 15%. WB will make it on the BAC commons' appreciation. IS EVERYBODY HAPPY? YES!!!!!!",
"Thanks for the article Glen.  Very solid points and highlights about the Collins Arguments.  I wish we could hit a fast-forward button on that case.As many of you mentioned—I also think it comes down to a court victory (for the need to move forward with Administrative Reform).  Better yet, would be a court victory unwinding the whole dang thing.  I’ll admit, I did day dream for a minute (after listing to the recording)—about a glorious Collins victory…sans the time frame it would take to get there.  Would 2 or 3 more years be worth-the-wait for absolute max common PPS?  Sure.  Especially if it was guaranteed.  But time is money, and there’s just too many dirty political curve balls on this one.  I’d humbly skip that timeframe, for a partial victory with Administrative reform this Summer.Seems to me that Peter Wallison is threat to any potential legal victory—because of his access to Judges.  Scarier yet, is his power to influence them.  Otherwise, we might have already won a case.Tim Howard’s blog has some recent interesting comments.  They point out how evident (although not absolutely proven) Wallison’s influence over Judge Ginsburg; completely turned the tables in the Perry Capital appeal.  Even Judge Brown (in her minority opinion) cited ridiculous AEI claims, as absolute fact.  Since there was no reason for her to mention AEI…or even quote them—it’s highly suspect that Wallison was standing over 2 of the Judge’s shoulders.  An obvious red flag/reminder how politically fraudulent this whole thing probably is.Anyway, from what I can find—it seems Wallison’s non-stop lobbying to kill Fannie & Freddie is his only ambition in life.  I'm not normally a conspiracy theory type of dude.  But, conspiracy or not, I hope Wallison can’t pull Sweeny’s strings.  Likewise, for the TX (Collins case) Judges.    “Wallison is not a passerby. In fact, he is the leading (paid) lobbyist against the GSE.""      ""He camouflages himself under the American Enterprise Institute, a so-called think tank,       that has been decades pushing the agenda of its funders (funders not founders) instead       of interest of the people.”Above 2 lines are quoted from “Rick” (on Tim Howard’s blog post comments from March 10’th 2018.",

When will the next ruling come in the Collins court?,
Trump would so love to be liked and respected by the financial elites of this country but this will never happen.  Just look at his history and all the sly comments and polite put downs he has endured even before he took office. The people that Trump still has around him as it relates to Housing Finance and Reform are only those just waiting for the chance to convince Trump during one of his angry moments that the GSE is bad for this country and must be turned over to the Private Financial Sector. They seem to change frequently and come into the Administration upon each resignation.,
"""Sealed amended complaints in confidential briefs."" ""Redacted discovery evidence is secret"". Now these court cases are more like a spy novel.

I feel like I'm in the ""Twilight Zone"" where Justices make outrageous rulings that no one understands how they could possibly conclude using existing laws for a decision.  Talk about a really screwed up judiciary , we got some real space cadet intellectuals.   So Sad.  On an optimistic note though, the ""Hotel California Comment "" was brilliant. KUDOS to that judge.

"There is some really good fodder in those transcripts.  Unfortunately, we've heard it all before.  At some point it has to matter that taking 100% of the net worth of the company in fact doesn't do a darn thing to put them in a sound and solvent condition.  The defendant atty, seems to think that having a Line of Credit for 280B more would be that ""solvent"" condition, that hey,  we'll lend you another 280B, you pay it all back and you'll now owe $400B.

At some point, truth has to win out or this Country is in deep cow pies. Thanks for the notes Glenn.",
"I have a problem with your, (and everyone else’s), theory about this situation being just about money. Sure, with the money the government is taking from Fannie and Freddie, (although, to be fair, it’s being given to them by a feckless Watt, who could stop anytime, not just taken!), the government has a windfall here. But what about the other side? What if they were released?According to Yahoo, Fannie Mae has 1.6 billion outstanding shares and Freddie Mac has 650 million. If these companies were released the stock price would, more than likely, be somewhere between $40 and $60, maybe higher. How much in capital gains taxes would be collected at that point? Seems to me it would be much more than is being collected from the profits. So, personally, I think it’s obvious this is not just about money. It’s actually looking like the people in government are just too stupid to see the obvious, if it’s just about the money.Or am I the idiot?",

"I cannot see why Mnuchin would act at all.  There is no benefit for him to take all the heat for making a decision on this.  If he waits for a legal verdict, either one he likes or doesn't like, he can then show his hand and act.

Look at his history !!I still advocate for Court settlements since with court settlements the rules and principles of Law and Business are etched in stone in out countries laws.File more suits, challenge more rulings, push more courts and eventually they will have to take a stand one way or the other and out of that will allow the public and academics to discuss and dispute the findings for time and memorial.

The one thing that would hurt, and hurt badly is if there is some B.S. 'record date' that would screw the majority of current shareholders (Jr. preferred + commons).IMHO the OPTICS of Trump/Mnuchin 'bailing out' or 'rewarding' private shareholders goes directly against Trump's populism.

"In 2030 Airbus will be addressing the 777X problem it has with Boeing. In 2030 both Airbus and Emirates will have run out of gas and the A-380 becomes too expensive of an option. At a plus, $100 per barrel price for oil dooms the A-380 and threatens widebodies as a whole.",
Emirates is going to firm up the other 16 that they have on order. This is what Tim Clarke said last week....which is good for the programm,
Your right. It was the 777. Doesn’t change the comment.,
"It’s a 2 vs 4 engine argument in the end. 747-8 is struggling to stay in production as well. As long as the engine manufacturers can continue to field larger and larger engines, the big twins will continue to get bigger. GE just had first flight on “the worlds largest engine” (787-9). In fact, engine development activity leads aircraft development since it something takes longer to design and certify the engine. The engine is truly the elephant in the room in many cases.",
"Mr. Bechai............I'm thinking all pride.  The ""someday"" is so far out that it can not be seen from my seat.  The new 777X will haul close to 500 PAX with its two fuel efficient engines and dock up to every jetway in the world.  The 380 will trickle down to one or so a month for their sole customer, Emirates, to keep their line open.  That is a financial looser and I would think that the stockholders (other than the Euro governments) will be raising hell.Boeing has the financial diversity and strength to toy along with the 747, and I think that as the world economy upsurges and more nations and airlines get involved in the cargo business the 747-8f (and an occasional 747-8i) will be a profit maker.  But no such hope for the 380. As always, I love your articles and respect your view points.Joe In Georgia",
Right you are User.  I sure would like to see the (true) profit and lose statement on the 380.  I'll bet that even with the huge Euro subsidies (both over the table and under the table) it is still way in the red.  I can't understand why they keep sending them down the assembly line?Joe In Georgia,
"Huge capacity will one day be more needed, but i fully expect the technology of tomorrow would mothball this design in a minute. Airbus just didn't do their homework. Should have set aside the glory of manufacturing the largest passenger jet in the world and depended more upon analyzing the actual current need. The millions set aside to engineer this albatross to the company's future will be remembered longer than the jet took to plan, market, and engineer.",
I noticed that you don't own Boeing any longer....explain your reasons for this elimination please,
One thing bothers me about the Emirates order - It was coupled with the retirement of earlier A380s and Emirates have stated that they don't want the planes scrapped!!  Do airlines usually dispose of aircraft which are only 10 years old (or were the earlier ones inefficient?),
AB has fumbled the ball many times over but the last decade has been bad. BA is not perfect but has been more dependable.,
"OK, that does it. The 380 is a great airplane. If I can't fly it....well, I am just going to teleport everywhere I go.As a frequent traveler I am sick of riding in crappy airplanes. I want 380s and I want them now!PLease excuse mini-tantrum.",
Just a note about trade wars. Airbus should not even exist if one believes in fair trade. This was a plane manufacturer built by government.,
"Flown in 747s a lot, flown in A380s quite a bit. A380 is much much better to fly in, even economy passengers get picky once they have tasted the benefits, Economy prefer cost to time. The problem is that not filling a super Jumbo is a knife in it's back. Long distance cargo seems to be the best future for super jumbos. I am sitting on the sidelines, but also have concerms about Boeing.BA.L ordering one? Hmm!",
It doesn’t seem like the 380 is ever discussed as a cargo carrier. Why? Too big an investment to make it into a cargo A/C? Or is it that the cargo hubs would need major modifications to accommodate it.,
"In fact, the moment Virgin and Airbus announced the A350 deal, Richard Branson made allegations that the A380 order was de facto cancelled. I still expect BA to announce an order at Farnborough. And a neo when engine technology is mature enough and market appeal has improved. As it stands, it looks as Airbus is trying to synchronise those things.",
"Dhierin, It is implied in this article that the cancellations are some how related to Emirates firmed up orders.  How can Virgin's cancellations be related to Emirates orders?",
"Shame - the A380 is amazing to fly in.  So quiet, especially if you are in the upper level.Thing is - Airbus was counting on exclusivity here in the super jumbo category and with it the ability to earn excess profits that could be reinvested in the rest of the product assortment.I am still hopeful that there will be more adoption --- certainy there are plenty of highly trafficed routes for it.  Maybe airports just dont want to make the infrastructure investments?  But Dubai has already done so... or is it just that airlines prefer to have more frequent departures and so would rather send 2 or 3 planes a day intead of 1 or 2?  but the big routes, like Frankfurt - Dehli, you don't send that many planes anyway on the overnight... this should allow them to have more optimal landing windows.Dunno.  Not invested here except to say that I like flying in them so I hope demand picks up.",
The Middle East Carriers are fed up with delays from AB.,
Thanks for the correct information. You mentioned 'The Airbus A380 remains a nightmare for Airbus'.     Also for the taxpayer in the EU.,
"I am somewhat concerned about the  hub and spoke model and especially the Emirates mega hub and spoke.The biggest problem with the model is that business people don't like spending a 4-6 hours lay over, no matter how good the lounges are. And the bigger the plane as with the A380, the more passengers that have to be aggregated in the hub meaning longer lay overs than with smaller planes.Then to top it all A330, B787 and even B767 have owned new city pairs that the hub and spoke airlines have traditionally served with the hub and spoke, which means shorter direct travel times for business passengers and private travellers.",
"Yep, call the funeral and start final arrangements.Joe In Georgia",
"Not surprised and kinda feels like old news to be as I knew about this a few days ago. I still firmly believe the A380 is ahead of its time capacity wise and if able to still be in production, albeit with better fuel economy, in 10-15 years from now it may succeed.

"Well done. A looong time ago I went to Basel and visited a colleague of mine who had just taken  a position at RHHBY. I was deeply impressed with their facilities and their R&D. I recently bought a few hundred shares based on some of the information you've covered in your review. I too think they are a well run company with a keener focus than most if not all US pharma/biotech companies. Their diagnostic division is superb. Re your discussion of immuno-oncology, there are a number of huge problems facing companies that have entered this field. The number #1 IMO is cost. It might also be problem #2,3,4...The use of viral vectors for CAR T makes the treatment prohibitively expensive for anyone outside the 1%. As I read it ca. $500,000 to $1,000,000 at very specialized staging centers. It it is also currently a rather long process to construct the viral vectors, do all the appropriate controls etc. etc. The current protocols do not seem feasible IMO for solid tumors (brain, breast etc. etc. ) I think plasmid vectors, such as ""sleeping beauty"" (the product of a xon/ziop partnership) will supplant  viruses as the time from diagnosis to treatment is significantly shorter. (I own shares of both ziop and xon). The bispecific antibodies seem very promising. Your comparison of Roche to appl is apposite IMO. The only knock on Roche is that it trades on the pink sheets, does not have wide analyst coverage and is very thinly traded for a company of its size... If anyone reading this has a chance to visit Basel, go.",

"@Value Analyst, I'd be interested to see an analysis of the economies of scale for expanding the supercharger network as the total Tesla fleet grows in size. In some geographies, the operational cost increases should correlate close to 1-1 with unit sales (mostly dense urban areas where superchargers are already close to max capacity), while other locations really only exist because they're necessary to bridge long distances and likely won't hit capacity until the Tesla fleet is huge.

"Value Analyst,Your back of the napkin analysis for revenue boost ($50MM) sounds plausible, but did you consider that this might be a ploy to reduce expenses? Follow me.It is a well known fact that higher charge rates lead to fewer pack charges (shorter pack life). Only Tesla knows the exact numbers on that but it is plausible that overuse of the Superchargers is causing premature battery pack failure. With the generous pack warranty this could get costly and it is likely that Tesla is getting better warranty data on these pack failures. Consider that 2500 pack failures from the current fleet (=<1% of fleet) with a pack replacement cost (including shipping 1500 lb pack and installation) of $20,000 would cost Tesla $50 million in warranty. So, if the Supercharger charges reduce usage to that point the expense avoidance might be larger than the revenue.",

Tesla's move to raise charging rates abruptly could at best be sensible, but hardly ""brilliant"" as pronounced here.Speaking of brilliance, seeing how I lack that plus the foresight, maturity, and literacy skill of any Teslabot, I now have a question(s):  1)  Does the hike in charging rates degrade Tesla's supposed advantage in cost savings over normal cars?  And b)  Will those charging stations stay operational any more reliably than the assembly lines in Fremont?",
Here's a question. Since VA stated 90 percent of charging is done at home why would anyone with an apartment be in the market for a Tesla and if someone with a home was why not but a plug in Hybrid for thousands less?  Go Tesla !,
"While most here seem to be emphasizing issues related to free or not-free superchargers, the real problem Tesla has with regard to the Model 3 is service centers.  With the very long backlog at service centers for the current crop of Teslas in need of service, how on Earth will Tesla handle Model 3s that are supposed to be coming off the assembly line (pardon this old production concept) at a rate of 5000/week?",
"This move sounds like a belated admission that Tesla needs to address ballooning SG&A expenses. The company is building out a huge network of charging stations and the stations drain cash -- real estate taxes, maintenance, supervision, capital to build them etc. The network is becoming a significant fixed SG&A cost and raising the price to use the charging stations helps defray that big fixed cost item. Tesla needs to achieve positive cash flow soon, and rising costs from its charging station network work against profitability.",
"I could never understand how Tesla thought free charging was a good idea or even necessary, given the strong demand for their product. This is like ICE manufacturers providing free gas to its customers.How could that concept ever work out for the longer term? You give the market fuel for free, it will cause unlimited demand for that resource.In other words, the supply and demand curves will never intersect at a zero price. Since the intersection of the supply and demand curves equals the equilibrium price for a particular product or service, they will never be in balance. Withoot balance the market will never be cleared.That is the antithesis of brilliant......",
"@value analystperhaps this has already been addressed in the swarm of comments but...Have you done any analysis of the anti-congestion effect on the marginal increase in revenue from the superchargers? It would seem these would have conflicting effects and to determine if either are considerable, an estimate of the factor needs to be considered. it doesn't seem likely that both the anti-congestion and additional revenue can be seen as positives.Also, is there any data on how what % of the supercharger users are the grandfathered users? if this is considerable, than the change in price will hardly have an impact on either congestion or revenue.Lastly, out of curiosity, and this is open for anyone to answer but is there any type of verification in the referral program? what I mean to say, are there stipulations restricting someone from creating a ""match-maker"" business for those looking for referral partners?",
"Forgive my mental whiplash, but wasn't LOWER supercharger rates (as in, free for Model S/X) also a ""brilliant move"" at one time?Or is literally any change at all to anything, in either direction, ""brilliant"" in your estimation?  Curious, is it also ""brilliant"" to NOT change anything?",
"I'm not surprised that folks are complaining about no longer getting free electricity. When I drive my 80,000+ miles in the last 4.3 years, I use both expensive gas and cheaper electricity in my PHEV. I guess they have lost so much on their short positions, in aggregate, they need free fuel.I do owe the shorts a sincere thank you, they badgered me into taking more profits and diversifying, and reducing my basis costs.thanks for your article, look also at peripherals, metals in batteries, cathodes and anodes, enhanced processes, etcAloha",

VA: Whatever happened to the 7 cent/kWh promises for the Semi?,
Could the tsla charging stations be sold off to generate lump sum cash?,
"Unknown is the cost to install a super charger, plus the ongoing monthly cost of maintaining it. Rent? Base utility charge? Is some of the equipment rented? Depending on the location an upgrade to the electrical service may have been required, which might incur an additional monthly base fee before any power consumption is considered. Then of course Tesla has to pay for the power consumed in charging vehicles, and we can assume that get a decent rate, depending on the location. That rate might go slightly lower if they use more than a certain kWh per month. The most important info though is what is the average usage of a super charger? Is a car being charged 50% of the time? 10%? I suspect that between 10pm and 5am it's zero. Even at $0.25/kWh, is it even possible for a super charger to break even and pay for itself? I'm guessing super chargers are huge money losers and doubling rates will just ease a little bit of the pain for Tesla and they'll just lose a little less. I see no way of ascertaining if Tesla could actually make money on these things unless Tesla were to show the numbers. That's not happening.",
"I am not certain how a company raising its prices can be described as a ""brilliant"" move.  This is basic business management, especially when a company is losing $ 2B per year on the bottom line. The downside is that future customers will take note that Tesla has gone against it's word of providing free charging in the past. The upside is of course apparent, anything they can do without increasing capex or other costs such as a price increase will primarily drop straight to the bottom line.That is a good thing for the company, assuming it does not put a damper on future demand due to broken promises.",
"it isnot a brilliant move, it is a bad move. In the brig in some cash now, but will result in less buyers of tesla. It is a move a a cat that is dying",
"Having worked on the front lines at TSLA for 3 years, I know that this is not good news to anybody who is interested in buying a new car. Current Model S and X owners who have free charging for life may not care right now, but they will take this into consideration when planning a future purchase (free supercharging is tied to the car, not the owner, so it doesn't carry over).It also comes as a surprise to anybody qualified to buy who walks into a store with only basic knowledge of Tesla. Hearing that they have ""free charging for life"" from a current owner or a fan site and then being told that they may actually pay $15-$20 or more in some states per charge is a very different perception.",
"As a value investor, it is very hard to agree with you. Good luck with your long position.",
"I would argue that increasing Supercharger rates is actually one of the worst things Tesla could do:1. there are no barriers for the construction and expansion of alternative charging facilities, it's ongoing as we speak all over the world. If anything Tesla should have offered it for free for all its customers. That would be an advantage at a reasonably low cost. More of a marketing gimmick that would be perceived as a nice perk.2. cost of having a Tesla just went up even of the majority charges at him3. it smells of desperation: this was clearly a very attractive selling point for Tesla, no more. The company has been hinting at reducing costs: this is what it comes up with.",
"Tesla is looking for change in the sofa cushions.Maybe funds are getting super tight...So no capital raise while the SEC is investigating, huh?And no one wants to buy their debt?  And stopping the hand building M3 line in February so they don't have to pay as much for labor?Obviously, they need to fire lots of people.  Everyone from SCTY for a start.  That would reduce cash burn.",
"The outrage of the shorts and naysayers is funny.  Their indignation about a price change for charging that doesn't affect them personally is unbounded!  To sum up:  Teslas that have free charging will continue to have free charging.  Those Teslas that never had free charging will continue to not have it.  Tesla's pricing per KWh appears to be more than competitive with other EV chargers.  Relax people, it's going to be ok.",
"VA claims, ""Tesla's recent move is brilliant""Brilliant?  It's inevitable as Tesla struggles with cash flow.  VA, it's desperation, but you are clueless by ignoring the articles of others on SA< and the quarterlies.",

"Manufacturing new cars is just a lousy business. It's capital intensive and margins are razor thin (when you are reporting accurately and you are not subsidized to the tune of thousands of dollars per car by the government). Looking forward, this lousy sector is only going to get worse.",
"Actually I think this is a good move on Tesla's part and long overdue.  Still not enough to make it a profit center, but perhaps now they can slow the bleeding and continue to do some infrastructure build out that seems to be capital starved at the moment.",
"I'm not sure I totally understand one of your points: Why does this shift demand from the Model 3 to the S? Given the price difference between the models, saving a bit of money on supercharging seems like a drop in the bucket (especially when Tesla drivers charge at home 90% of the time). I mean, the difference between the prices is in the $50,000 range (depending on features and add-ons), right? The price difference you calculated from previous costs is $25 per year. I don't see a lot of people spending an extra $50,000 because they are going to save an extra $25 per year.",
"So let me get this straight - Tesla raises its charging rates and further narrows its so-called cost advantage over competitors and this is a good thing?  It increases the costs of ownership and this is a good thing?  Leaving aside that the company is bleeding so much cash that this won't make a material difference in its financial situation, this is another example of a Tesla bull grasping at straws.  How anyone can justify buying or holding this stock at its current price is one of the abiding mysteries of the stock market.  This stock should be sold before the bottom drops out.",
"@ValueAnalyst I agree with your point about the higher supercharger prices shifting the demand to home chargers, but I would add that in places where home charging is not possible the higher prices may shift demand to Tesla's and others' ""destination charging"" networks.  It has always made sense, except on long trips and for taxicabs, to use eight-hour charging during sleep hours and work hours, which this switch encourages.",

As the author states, Tesla owners charge their cars at home 90% of the time. To me, TSLA is also a capital-challenged company, which, per FastGraphs, CFRA has rated at a B-. Whatever benefit the charging network brings to TSLA, it would seem, would be at the margin of things.Best of luck to all.",
"I’m short $TSLA, but I have to admit raising rates to at least make these things pay for themselves is probably a good thing.  On the other hand, how many people actually pay for Supercharging?  X & S buyers can grab a referral code, so maybe a handful of them plus a few thousand 3 buyers.  So it’s a drop in the ocean of fiscal responsibility.",
This just shows that the SC business is highly unprofitable. It has huge implications to fast charging in general. For now the effect for Tesla will be  financially negligible.,
any list that compares the local energy prices with Tesla's new offering? I actually think this is a terrible move considering that they announced a price of 7 cent per kwh for Semi customers. They basically killed the truck story by announcing that they won't be able to deliver such cheap electricity.Therefore I would love to see a list of the local/regional energy prices before giving credit to Tesla for this strategy,
"Brilliant move or dangerous precedent?Giving zero notice period, just a flick of the switch nearly doubling the price overnight, is hardly conducive to consumer confidence in their budgeting.",

Hmmm as of yesterday the superchargers were TSLA's greatest competitive advantage over competitors. As of today encouraging users not to use them and charge at home is somehow a very positive thing.

"You cannot fix a problem like congestion by increasing price in hopes people will recharge at home. There is a reason why most people recharge at supercharger stations, they cannot recharge at home. Hiking the price to ""force"" people to recharge elsewhere will cause many to sell and find a different car. This is no different than a cable company jacking up the price and the consumer looks elsewhere for service. This also brings up Tesla's claim that they are going to be able to sell semi truck buyers electricity for $.07/kWh despite the fact that in some states, Tesla is charging a car owner up to three times that much if not more.",

Actual power output will average much less than that and nameplate is met only during maximum ideal winds. Higher winds would mean shutdown and lower winds would mean lower output. The article states wind power will stimulate Statoil growth but demonstrates no financials on how this will occur. Wind farms require massive subsidies to operate.

The net effect of this is the claim becomes, “Oil companies are doing this and it’s a good idea because Oil companies say it’s a good idea.” There is zero independent analysis presented.At the very least, show us some indication of how such projects are performing today?

The distribution is not a dividend and Schwartzman's units are equal to yours, not preferred or options.The talk about a C Corp is all due to the lower tax rates going into effect this.  Although some MLPS (think pipelines) have tax sheltered income, Blackstone has very little return of income and tax shelter so if Blackstone converted to a c Corp the income would be distributed to investors as a dividend at a lower tax rate.  However revenue would be taxed which it is not currently.  So a lot to balance but the market would better understand the c Corp and probably give it a higher valuation than we're getting now.",

"Good write-up, Andrew. I covered DB when I worked in equity research in Munich some time ago for one of its main domestic rivals. I was also invested for eight years, and went through two cash calls, countless profit warnings and a comprehensive management reshuffle.I have a problem with trust, so: Never again. Despite the changes, those who are familiar with the board members know the place is still run by a bunch of execs who cannot see the forest for the trees. It was the same with Dresdner Kleinwort before the bailout. I totally agree DB could be a highly speculative trade around these levels (it has been historically), although more downside is apparent due to possible write-downs, impairment risk as well as litigation risk.I do not cover it daily as I did until last year, but as Moody's pointed out in Feb ""the €1.4 billion non-cash write down of deferred tax assets shaved roughly 10 basis points off the basis points off DB’s fully loaded Basel III CET1 capital. Going forward the firm expects an effective tax rate at the lower end of a 30 to 35% range, which will boost DB’s internal capital generation"" but there remains regulatory risk, IMO. The rating agency also pointed out, and rightly so, that after adjusting for strategic business disposals and DVA adjustments, ""revenues declined 10% in the quarter. Some of this decline is a function of low client activity in capital markets, but the decline may also be contributing to some rethinking of elements of the strategy by management - as they attempt to gauge which downturns in activity are structural as opposed to merely cyclical. The bank made progress on various strategic initiatives and is on track to float a minority stake in asset management and to merge the German retail banks, likely in the first half of 2018 . Nonetheless, the quarter’s operating loss illustrates the scale of the reengineering task still facing the firm.""",

"Sigh...Well what is your take on the FDA wanting another 3 months to review new data submitted by PGNX? Once again PGNX’s wonderfully incompetent management team finds away to screw this up. Much like they did when Azedra’s topline data came out. Or their three month delay with the NDA filing. Do these guys not know what they are doing because it sure as hell feels that way. I don’t know, this management team leaves a lot to be desired. They aren’t as bad as SGYP’s management but they are a close second. Brutal.",
so azedra approval wouldn't get PGNX a voucher??,
"Hi Bret, You mention approval would also provide a voucher for PGNX; is that true? is there market value attached to that, or other practical value for the pipeline?",
"Even north of $8 PGNX is still severely undervalued... To me the Conference Call was much more interesting than the Earnings.. The earnings were expected to be good seeing that we already know the Relistor numbers when VRX reported their earnings a coupe weeks back.  On the CC it was interesting when an analyst asked in the Q&A session on the CC about the pricing on Azedra.. Baker said there was likely to be a pretty good premium on it...So I wonder if Baker is now leaning more towards the higher end of his estimates than the lower end..  Also, very interesting that they were seeking a partner in Asia....I think the Asian market will effectively double the Azedra market perhaps even more than that... Sounds like the EU might require a trial there.. The one thing that concerned me a bit was the 1404...That topline dating is coming up this summer... How robust does that data need to be in order to avoid having to do another trial?? I would like you thoughts on that..The other treatments in the pipeline sound like they are coming along nicely...  Anyway, thanks for the update on PGNX... I still think even at $8 a share it's woefully undervalued and it might take the market a while even after approval to catch up to a more fair value...I guess we see..Thanks Bret.",Our Post-Earnings Take On Progenics Pharmaceuticals

Q1 was a disaster and yet they maintain guidance for the year after doing $65M in revenue.  I do not see how they make it up.  Also I am blown away by this given Harry had visibility into Q1 revenues back when he did his CC for Q4 on March 12th with just 2.5 weeks to go in the quarter.  Are you kidding me?  Zero command or credibility right now.  And the last CC he demonstrated quite clearly how unpredictable revenue forecasting will be going forward.  Why?  Because he has no clue how many physicians and physician practices will remain loyal or continue/discontinue alignment with Nobilis.  They lost two practices last quarter and that has major impact on volumes and revenue.  So how can we as investors expect much in terms of growth forecasting?  On a more positive note they have at least shown they are executing on the cost side of their operations.,

Your perspective is appreciated....,
"Oh...and do not forget that Harry has announced Twice that the Board of Directors had approved a multi-million dollar share buyback.  Last time in Q3 '17 ($4 million).  This buy back has never occurred.  And it never will.  It is simply a marketing tactic to stop the slide of the stock price.  Some say they used the $$ for acquisitions.  They knew they were acquiring all along, and hence should have never made such a false statement if they did not have the funds.  Just another ""undelivered"" comment from Harry.Maybe the truth is.....""you mean I am supposed to create value for shareholders?...well they never taught me that in law school""  Can I sue someone?

"Jeremy...as a long term shareholder in HLTH, regrettably, I have an ethical and moral obligation to warn others regarding Harry and the team at Nobilis.  The aforementioned comments like ""omitted comment on the $6.8 million AP waiver"", or Harry saying ""I do not know why the stock price has flat-lined (you have got to be kidding me by the way), are just 2 instances in a long multi year string of ""fumbles"" and ""Rookie Comments"" made by Harry Fleming.  They just keep piling up quarter after quarter.  The 5 cent tick program is irrelevant.  If they had improved quarterly revenue and earnings like they forecasted and announced in the past quarters, the stock price would reflect the true value.  Please do not patronize by using the tick rule or hurricane.  The market is smarter than that. Jason Donville (asset manager), who once was a significant investor in HLTH prior to the ""Emperor has no clothes"" debacle that exposed Nobilis (Harry's)' foul play, once told me he exited his investment because because Harry has no clue what he is doing.  Well now, that is interesting.Warning:  1)  no institutional investors.  Why?  They have been burned more than once with Harry's omissions and knuckle-headed statements, and incompetence.  They are no fools.2)  No Insider buying at these levels.3)  CFO has only purchased 10,000 shares .  Odd.  Guess he likes to put his money where he will realize a positive return...with much less risk.4)  As long as Harry is both Chairman & CEO (which is never a good thing...see GE), you are not buying Nobilis.  You are buying Harry.  Please research his work prior to Nobilis to see for yourself the similar problems that caused his last business to shut the doors.5)  Oh..by the way, Harry also got amnesia regarding the large physician group they lost in Q4 of 2016 which significantly impacted revenue.  No mention of this in SEC documents or conference calls either.  Misleading, and a potential SEC violation.6)  Their current President has zero operations experience in this space.  Just think for a second, a Chairman & CEO cannot explain why their stock price has dropped and flat-lined.  Well if Harry does not know the problem, then how in the world can he know how to fix it.  And the list goes on, and on, and on, and on......",

It seems as thou there is a drag on (none Elite) revenues considering the amount of growth they have put on in the past 3 years.Also Harry and company could benefit from some Professional Investor Relations Assistance which I think has deteriorated along with some of there results in the last few years.",

PFS for Upper Zone is out: Stunning! Serbian Minister of Mining and Energy is quoted with supportive statements in press release. Enjoy!,
"The pleasant surprise for me is that Nevsun  receives the permit for the exploration decline at Timok Project. Delayed (3 to 6 months), but faster than I thought. Congratulations to the team around Mr. Kukielski and the Serbian administration for reaching this milestone. From now on, the share price will correlate with the construction progress of the Timok Mine.The only obstacle would be a sharp decline in the price of base and precious metals due to reduced global economic growth caused by protective tariffs and trade restrictions.",
I too think Nevsun will get bought out within the next year or so. Probably by Lundin. The PFS being released this month will add some clarity to potential suitors.,

"I like Timok, there is upside to Nevsun's valuation. Just don't know when the market is willing to give it any slack. There is a lot of resistance up to about the $2.75 level. If the shares can get above there, it probably means market sentiment has turned favorable so might be a better entry. Otherwise you risk waiting quite a long time for the stock to chew threw that nasty resistance.",
"I'm one of those people who have made money in junior mining companies.  But I also agree its not for the faint hearted or those unwilling to take the time and effort to do research and learn the industry.  Junior mining stock prices can fluctuate dramatically and there are a wider range of risk factors than most other stocks.  Metal prices are highly volatile and mining projects are frequently located in high risk countries.  For me, key factors for success include: 1) a good deposit; 2) a strong management team (technically and capable of managing country risk, as well as environment and social issues; 3) conservative financial practices (liquidity is key as companies may need to endure long periods of negative cash flow while riding out low price cycles and/or developing the project); and 4) a management that delivers on what it promises.  NSU's prior management team actually did a great job in the early years in developing Bisha in Eritrea but in the latter years underperformed, misled investors and over-promised.  They were pressured into paying more than they expected for Timok.  It's stock price dived.  I've been in NSU a few years so can fully understand prior investors' frustration.That being said, I'm positive about the future.  Their new CEO, which came on board last year, realized he needed to rebuild investor credibility.  He doesn't overpromise.  He conservatively wrote down Bisha, with the objective to maximize near term cash flow in order to develop and focus on Timok.  He has been taking short term pain to achieve long term gain.  My sense is the stock price is gradually reflecting this.There are few mining projects out there with the positive characteristics of Timok.  Yes, there will be more unexpected hiccups along the way as that is the nature of mining.  That being said, this is a great entry point, provided an investor is willing to take a long term perspective.  As the article notes, over the next few years this could turn into a multi-bagger or, as Short Stack notes, could be taken out in the nearer term at a 40-50% premium (or more).   Bottom line, look at the future, not the past.",

"If it's not one thing, it's another with mining companies. The longer you live, the more you learn to steer clear of mining stocks. So many investors have already been burned on this ridiculously undervalued stock.  I""m too tired to list all the things that have gone wrong for this company already and some of the things that can still go wrong. Most frustrating of all is this: a mining company can do everything right and still lose because the underlying commodity tanks in price, or there's difficulty dealing with the local opposition to a mining project or a corrupt or highly inefficient foreign government. I want to wish Nevsun investors well but I look back on a number of sure things that did not quite work out in the world of mining stocks. Here's another problem: if things go wrong, the shareholders will take all the losses. If Nevsun executes perfectly and all goes well...just before you're about to reap the fruits of your risk-taking some bigger company will swoop in and buy the company for a 40 or 50% premium. If that sounds good, you should understand that most investors bought at a higher price and were hoping for a multi-bagger. Chances are we're taking all the risks and some bigger mining company like Lundin or Freeport will enjoy most of the rewards if things go well. If things do not go well...the losses are all yours guys. Enjoy!",

Making the new world a reality will require an increasingly more intense integration of HW, OS, and Application S/W. Nobody touches Apple in this regard. Not Microsoft, not Amazon, not Google, not FB, not anyone. When you factor in the unmatched flexibility afforded to them by their capital structure and the fact that they control the interface to more than 1.3B active devices, it's hard to imagine a new world without Apple playing a very prominent role.

Even based on today's closing px of $11.93, an investor could achieve an annualized return in excess of 10% even in the least ideal scenarios with certain closing times increasing that return substantially.With a pretty strong amount of institutional ownership of CAFD and no public statements of opposition to the transaction (outside of those crap lawsuits that always emerge), it seems like the shareholder vote should be a non-event.

Lots of municipal and NIMBY players will make 5G rollout arduous and unlike the case now where new technologies could be upfitted/bolted onto existing towers, 28 GHz is a whole new ballgame, more like point-to-point microwave.I don't recommend anyone getting even an inch over their ski tips re 5G OEM speculation, except for the fact it will need a ton of  fiber backhaul.",

"Very interesting article Doc, I am not familiar with personalized vaccines.  Are they similar to CART? (require patients own blood and custom made for them).I assume they are ""modern"" vaccines..  Old vaccines have terrible record of clinical data. especially large phase 2/3 trails (sometimes they have promising phase 1 data then failed miserably in randomized phase 3). I have previously read some articles, they said some vaccines successfully stimulated immun response however they couldn't fight cancer cells due to all the escape mechanisms and cancer micro environment. I was hoping PD1+vaccines combo can achieve meaningful clinical benefit since PD1 will block some very important escape mechanisms. Btw are you going to write an article about REGN's ODYSSEY study result? I am eager to read your opinion since you are cardiov expert :)  Personally i thought the result was good and price cut was good decision as well but the SP is dropping atm, very surprising.",

"Scancell to collaborate with BioNTechTue, 9th Jan 2018 07:00RNS Number : 1654BScancell Holdings Plc09 January 201809 January 2018 Scancell Holdings Plc(""Scancell"" or the ""Company"") Scancell to collaborate with BioNTech to investigate T cell receptor based therapeutics for the treatment of cancer Agreement expands potential therapeutic utility of Moditope® to adoptive T cell therapy Scancell Holdings plc, ('Scancell' or the 'Company') the developer of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, is pleased to announce that it has entered into a research collaboration with BioNTech for the potential development of innovative, T cell receptor based therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. This research collaboration combines Scancell's Moditope® immunotherapy platform and BioNTech's platform technology for high-throughput cloning and characterisation of naturally selected T cell receptors. Moditope® represents a completely new class of potent and selective immunotherapy agents which could have a profound effect on the way that cancer immunotherapies are developed. It acts by stimulating the production of CD4+ T cells using citrullinated tumour-associated peptide epitopes which overcome self-tolerance and destroy tumour cells. The technology overcomes the immune suppression induced by tumours themselves without the need for checkpoint blockade inhibitors, thereby allowing activated T cells to seek out and kill tumour cells that would otherwise be hidden from the immune system. Under the terms of the agreement, Scancell and BioNTech will enter into an initial research collaboration to discover and characterise T cell receptors specific for citrullinated epitopes from vimentin and enolase. These epitopes form the basis of Scancell's first Moditope® development candidate, Modi-1. Upon completion of these studies, BioNTech will have the exclusive option to enter into a licence agreement for the development of cell receptor based therapeutics that are specific to Modi-1 epitopes. Prof Lindy Durrant, Chief Scientific Officer of Scancell, commented: ""We are delighted to be working with BioNTech, one of Europe's new immuno-oncology power-houses, to investigate the development of targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Pre-clinical data from our Moditope® platform has shown unprecedented anti-tumour effects can be delivered without the need for checkpoint inhibition. We believe that this, combined with BioNTech's engineered T cells specific to Moditope® epitopes, could have great potential as a novel immunotherapy.""

"Collaboration agreement with ISA PharmaceuticalsThu, 15th Feb 2018 07:00RNS Number : 9322EScancell Holdings Plc15 February 2018 ISA Pharmaceuticals and Scancell enter collaboration agreement for the manufacturing, development and commercialisation of Modi-1 / AMPLIVANT® combination AMPLIVANT-Modi-1 conjugate expected to enter clinic in H1 2019Collaboration seeks to further leverage Moditope® platform Leiden, The Netherlands, and Oxford, UK, 15 February, 2018 -- ISA Pharmaceuticals B.V. ('ISA'), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company, and Scancell Holdings plc, ('Scancell' or the 'Company'), the developer of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, are pleased to announce that they have entered into a worldwide licensing and collaboration agreement to use ISA's AMPLIVANT® adjuvant technology for the manufacturing, development and commercialisation of Scancell's first Moditope® development candidate, Modi-1.  This partnership has the potential to provide a new treatment option for patients with triple negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, sarcomas, and other solid tumours. Under the terms of this agreement, ISA has granted Scancell an exclusive worldwide license to manufacture, develop and commercialise the AMPLIVANT®:Modi-1 conjugate therapy and will contribute know-how and expertise related to AMPLIVANT®. Clinical studies will be conducted by Scancell and are expected to commence in H1 2019. In return, ISA will receive an upfront payment from Scancell and is entitled to milestone and royalty fees following achievement of certain criteria as defined in the agreement.  Financial details were not disclosed. Previous pre-clinical data demonstrated that conjugation of the Modi-1 peptides to AMPLIVANT® enhances anti-tumour immune responses 10-100 fold and resulted in highly efficient tumour eradication, including protection against tumour re-challenge. ISA's AMPLIVANT® technology can be applied to any type of targeted immunotherapy, significantly enhancing its efficacy.  It is based on a proprietary and synthetic small molecule TLR1/2 ligand with enhanced immunostimulatory activity that can be chemically coupled to the respective immunotherapeutic. AMPLIVANT® conjugates allow lower dosing with higher efficacy through better dendritic cell antigen processing and presentation, as well as enhanced T cell priming. Scancell's Moditope® platform acts by stimulating the production of CD4+ T cells using citrullinated tumour-associated peptide epitopes.  This technology overcomes the immune suppression induced by tumours themselves, allowing activated T cells to seek out and kill tumour cells that would otherwise be hidden from the immune system. ""This collaboration is an important step to advance new adjuvant technologies such as AMPLIVANT® to clinical-stage programmes and bring patients better treatments,"" said Ronald Loggers, CEO of ISA Pharmaceuticals.  ""The partnership will further validate the power of AMPLIVANT® conjugates for use in therapeutic cancer vaccines that carry a variety of epitopes, including post-translationally modified epitopes such as Scancell's Moditope® products."" Cliff Holloway, CEO of Scancell, commented:  ""This collaboration with ISA Pharmaceuticals is an important step in the continued development and commercialisation of our first Moditope® immunotherapy, Modi-1, which has the potential to treat patients with triple negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer and sarcoma who are resistant to other immunotherapies.  Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated Modi-1 induces potent anti-tumour responses and significant improvements in survival.  We believe that combining Modi-1 with an enabling adjuvant technology such as AMPLIVANT® has the potential to significantly enhance its efficacy in patients and we are looking forward to moving this important and novel therapy into the clinic in the first half of 2019.""

"Thank you DoctorRX for a great, insightful look at what is modern technology coming into a serious disease and empowering ones own immune system to detect and the defeat ones own cancer.  Early days as they say.  On that note, I am sure you keeping your eye on DCVAX L developed by NorthWest Bio.  Its phase III trial will read out by ASCO this year, IMHO. It is individualized and completely non-toxic. It is powerful and can penetrate even the toughest of cancer cells, GMB.  It is completely written off by experts and on the brink of extinction as a going concern, but seems to have found a way to hang on till ASCO. Early days.  I am not an analysis or a scientist. I am not pumping the company, just pointing out their science is real and the trial is on-going in 4 countries and people taking it in a compassionate use setting are seeing positive results, but that is unofficial, of course.

Quite a run-up in April.  In at a tad over $37 since Feb.,
there isn't a different type of customer. if xyz wants an alarm they go to web and research. all you have to is see all the mom and pop companies closing up shop. the mom and pop are the dealers. they would be 100% better off selling directly,

Thx for the article. Lots of good information. I can’t believe you never once mentioned vivint.smarthome tho. They were the dealer who got alarm.com started. But they have since created their own hardware and software platform and have 1.3 million of their own customers.,
international markets are really bad in terms of penetration rates. they don't use alarms like the US. in the US their model is not the best because their customer's RMR is really low and relies heavily on mom and pop who can't compete any more,Alarm.com: Well Protected Vs.
