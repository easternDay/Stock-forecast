"I’m just starting to build a portfolio of lithium stocks, so right now I’m doing my due diligence. What I can tell you concerning the Morgan Stanley note is this, generally the retail brokers are at the very end of the tentacles of information at every major brokerage firm. If an analyst is going to downgrade or upgrade a particular stock or industry they will tell the institutional sales people first. Also, keep in mind that firms trade for their own account. There is supposed to be a “Chinese wall’ between research and trading. All The major firms push accounts with check writing privileges and credit or debit cards. In the paperwork of those accounts are margin papers, so even if you don’t use margin, your stocks are held in street name and can be borrowed or lent to a short seller which could be anybody or even the firm where you have the account.",
"Azachar,If you follow Matt, you know the answer.",
It seems Mark Bohlsen never heard of Tawana Resources - the first 2018 lithium producer in Australia.Not even mentioning of TAW in February lithium summary is not a good sign of lithium news knowledge by the author.,
"Dear Matt, is there a reason for the big drop of LIX's share price? any news / rumor on the acquisition?",
"On CC note comments about ""no grid demand factored in"" - if I heard correctly.Grid demand for storage could easily challenge if not surpass EV demand",
"Matt, thank you for sharing."" PILBF plans to begin production of lithium 2H2018."" this really good news, how can it speed the project this fast?",
"Bill,Like said before, that Morgan Stanley guy put a bucket of cold water on my lithium stocks. I did not know what was his motive, the supply tons and demand tons of lithium just do not add up but he can manipulate the market.",
"I just saw this headline: ""Lithium glut? No way, say industry executives eyeing demand"".  The link is below.  Others are saying the same thing.  Also, Pilbara came out with great news last night.  Matt, another great article--thanks for all your info.http://bit.ly/2F9dPc1",

"To what extent do you believe the $90B investments by other (than Tesla) auto manufacturers?  It will be hard for them to turn the ship from their entrenched legacy ICE investments, not to mention the supply chain and theirs.  Retooling and scrapping are huge obstacles - psychological if not merely economical.But it is not just cars, trucks or even ships.A huge amount is likely to go into solar and wind battery storage - but, to what extent?Also there is a growing business of electricity banking such as in Vermont.PowerWalls are being installed (soup to nuts) for $1,500 so customers will charge them on the grid for dumping back to the grid for peak usage in order to avoid revving up standby coal.Simply charging PowerWalls on a vast scale enables power production to be kept high and steady to surpass daytime demand with surplus being stored for peaks at dinnertime.  More efficient grid supply operations result in cost savings in the end.",
the Chinese already locking up long term supply agreements mostly with aussies due to supply and proximity. seems like they will be the opec of the lithium market. questions buehler buehler,
Many are confusing lithium with lithium Battery Technology.   Now whoever owns and licenses the patent technology for the best lithium battery will be the best stock to buy and make a lot on that particular stock.  Lithium is found in quite abundance on every major continent.   So there’s not a shortage or even a projected shortage .  Why are readers buying it?,
"The Chinese have already built a cargo ship for short hauls (50 miles) that is totally lithium battery propelled.  Once they include PV cells and wave action to recharge the batteries, or other advanced technology, the distance will increase and further drive lithium demand.",
seems like the uncertainty and production shortfalls at tesla are startin to trickle down to various eco system suppliers in lithium. keep the positive news comin like the Chinese electric bus ramp up and geely saying Volvo will be entirely electric by 2019. imho ramp ups and progress seems more imminent in china and Scandinavian countries than in  us and Canada.  seems like weed stocks getting more buzz no pun intended. glta rr,
The MS analyst who predict this has a amazing 0.9% return last year in his portfolio!,
"If lithium price action declines over the next couple years, wouldn't it make sense that the small producers would eventually go out of business? Then, the big players like Albemarle and SQM would most likely survive. Such a huge drop today on Albemarle with the MS report that price declines would be expected as early as next year or a couple years later. Why the drop today for such a longer term situation that really can't be validated. Scared investors off, but they will return.Not a fan of MS as they periodically attempt to influence price action in other stocks as well. More than one person has called for an investigation of some of these crooked brokers.",
"Hi Matt,Why is Albemarle (ALB) shares falling even though the lithium market seems conducive to share price increase???",
"Tend to agree with observation that Morgan Stanley may be shorting Albemarle.  One investment site,  http://bit.ly/2F6JevB, whose reliability I have no idea about published following comment on Albemarle short positions""Albemarle’s short interestAs of January 31, 2018, Albemarle’s (ALB) short interest had increased in a big way since its 3Q17 earnings announcement on November 8, 2017, which indicates bearishness. Between November 8 and January 31, ALB’s short interest as a percentage of outstanding shares rose to 8.2% from 5.4%, and its stock price fell from $140.84 to $111.59.""They attributed this to SQM deal with Chilean government to increase allowed levels of production but MS may well be trying to amplify the impact by their announcement today",

"No matter the accuracy of their predictions; their track record; or, obvious conflicts of interest with IB--any Morgan Stanley analyst will make a print.. So what? Li is not sodium chloride. The timing of new, large scale capacity coming on stream tied to a pick of demand is not a snap of finger. Capital commitments required for such ramp up are the result of serious-detailed-and well footed studies..not a whim triggered by a stock pattern.  Matt is completely correct when he says follow the money..",

"Matt,No news for OROCF?",Lithium Miners News For The Month Of February 2018
"Since the stock price decline there have been no large option trades in OLED until today. Today Bloomberg published an article that was negative on OLED for 2018. With OLED closing down at $125.55 someone spent $703,500 on 1,500x June $130/$120 put spreads. The $130 put delta is in-the-money which somewhat hardens the delta and probably makes this an outright short position with the view that although the remaining downside may or may not be substantial, the upside has been beaten out of the stock (at least until the back half of the year).",
"Great report, but I have been wondering for some time whether leading edge sensors are better off with OLED screens?  This could provide an entirely new market for OLED screens, as sensor equipment proliferate all over the world and across all manner of use cases.",

One may be able to trade it if one is a successful trader, but that's a difficult row to hoe. If market goes down, OLED will get clobbered...possibly down to $90 where it had a huge gap up. Odds are significant that gap eventually gets re-traced.Finally, the company changed its revenue recognition accounting. Someone please tell me what the effect will be on future growth rate.

"The stock got ahead of itself and it has now retreated to October 2017 levels. The fundamentals are still very good, even with the weaker short term guidance. With the Samsung contract sorted out and a number of new clients on board the downside is very limited. I bought back some shares at 129 that I sold on the way up for 142. Blue emitter, Samsung getting back into OLED TVs and longer term OLED lightning could give an important boost to the price. And in 3 months solid earnings and raised guidance would help.",

I hope HK hedges much of their oil production once WTI goes $60+ for a least next couple of years (2020 and onward). Hope they will play it smartly and conservatively couple of years out and protect from liquidity drying up and potential recession. Way more interested in getting intrinsic value of stock and staying solvent than to catch all upside possible. Halcon stock prices have been getting punished like crazy.,
I hope bullish oil market can help the stock gain a couple of bucks. It's tough seeing HK stagnant while other equities are seeing gains.Anybody knows when HK could start to get into mid $5's? When is appreciation expected? Maybe production growth can lead to price increase in 2019?,
"I just noted that the short % of the float on HK is now up to 20%, which is pretty large. Seems like a terrible risk-reward to me to short HK, but still interesting. Do you have any clue what the short case is Laurentian? Is there reason to think the acreage is performing sub par? Is drilling data and well production public?",
"LR,What is your latest assessment of Halcon? Where do see it going by the EOY?",
Thx . Any other E&amp;P in Permian you advise to read on . I found that the Permian takeaway constrain is an opportunity rather than a curse . Early this year ; I take into cve on the wcs/wti spread in slum ; it turns out to be a very good play .,
"LR, is it the reason for  HK  not performing compared  with other oil producers is because of the pipeline constraint?  If that is the case, can i say HK will be the 2019 star stock",
"Heavy volume today, Franklin?",
At this rate they will be done by next month.,
Have we finally begun the process of freeing ourselves from Franklin?,
"LR, what is your take on earning. I don't like their hedging.",
"LR, I just bought some HK today after many times reading your articles and others' comments!  Hope after hour ER will be good! Glad to know that Ares bought more HK!",
"22023171,Looks like valuation does not matter these days.",
They have more hedges for 2019 than 2018. So this is really a long term play if they have to ramp up production. Hopefully service cost won’t go thru the roof,
"Painful to hold this stock when other stocks like GPRK, DNR are kissing 52 weeks high. Patience is what needed most here.",
"LR,Do you know how many shares our friend from Franklin is holding now. I am following another company EXXI, and it seems Franklin sold most of shares of EXXI.",
Think the lows are already in on HK with insiders buying I picked up more shares at $5.02 this morning.,
LR- again great article and nice call getting this on my radar.  I am hopeful that vtvt will double in size in the next month and the stars align where I can swap into HK when it is hopefully in the low 4’s and oil is more in favor.  Good luck and hopefully we get our wish for lower prices so we can amplify our gains.   Let’s keep this thread alive.,
"Concho sold 20,000 net acres, primarily non operated, acres in Ward and Reeves for $280mm.",
"This is a classic case of ‘less is more’.  While the market struggles to grasp the true value and high level analysis of p/s and overhead and costs are looked at on the surface while not looking under the hood, you get the current price deterioration in s sector that is selling off any news at the moment.  Just look at the recent news of QEP and the market yawned.   My advice is get the cash ready and be patient.  Very possible that HK hits 4’s before the upswing based on the selling overhang that needs to be worked through (possibly lower).   Then pile in BIG, lock it up and enjoy....",
"The recent quarterly report 25M sales,, if annualized  100M ,, Market cap 842M , how  can an E&P company be worth 8 times sales.? even if sales triples to 300M it is not cheap. Is there something I don't know ? Exactly why did sales drop by 75% ? Please , where am I going wrong?",
"Why it is going down? Bond holder is selling? Exactly same thing is happening in EXXI. Do you know how many shares Flanklin has left, if that firm is selling?",
"LR, do you have an estimate for 2018 ebitda? I'd like to know the valuation of HK on an operating basis. Thanks for the write-up.",
"LR, have you looked at SM at all?   I am looking at it around $20k per Midland acre.   And their Howard county properties quite good.  Very high oil percent and good returns. A bit messy though to put a value on their Eagle Ford and smaller Rocky position.    Their Eagle Ford mostly gas followed by ngls.   It’s mostly production  value and probably not in acre value in their location there. ESTE possibly  better, but I like Howard county over Reagan at this point.",
"Looking at JAG, I am computing production adjusted enterprise value around $24k/acre.    Overall, I like their land locations a bit better than HK.  At least well results seem better.   They seem to be most comparable to HK, being concentrated in a similar area. Cash costs running lower than HK.   Although they may be higher in non cash G&A.     Would like to see their year end results.",
"I can't understand the ""As of February 2018"" where adding 3,000 acres appears to lower net per acre by $4,000.  Math just doesn't work any way I figure.",
"Debt will be a bit higher now than the 9/30 adjusted level.  Maybe $75-100mm. Interesting that the median valuation, based on enterprise value of the Delaware companies you list, is around $24k/acre.     That might be a reasonable target.    Market seems to put less value per acre than transaction prices.",
"jcolbyclark I tried to figure this out awhile back. I finally gave up sec data, web artticles, etc. etc. you would think it would be simple I found out differently and just reduced my position in HK and moved into OAS and QEP. If you figure it out please share. Thanks to LR",
Halcon Resources: The Case For A Strong BuySomeone should pass this along to Franklin,
"Any thoughts on why the sellers are selling the Ward acre to them so cheap?     I can see at monument draw  HK might now be the best buyer  since they already have the neighboring property. The main part of the value thesis is the that acres they bought in Ward in past months and past year for less than $15k average are now worth $33k. That leaves 2 possibilities.   They got a bargain or they aren’t worth $33k. I admit results are good there, and they probably got a bargain due to risk nature and maybe need to drill to keep the leases.  As noted before, Pecos results are not super exciting so far.   I think they paid full value or beyond there.  Fang deal certainly seems better at the moment. My gut is they won’t get a $33k /acre valuation as an operating company (maybe in a takeover), but it certainly could get to over $20k.   A number of companies trade below what value per transaction acre would imply.   Maybe in cases where operating costs  seem high and maybe faith in management not that high.",
Well done series LR and very reasonable PT.  Look forward to following this one!,
An investment here essentially comes down to ‘Faith in Floyd’!,
Price target?,
"great article. what value are you attributing to production and what metric are you using to get down to an adjusted $ per net acre valuation for comps? also, I think some of the comps might have off balance sheet liabilities or acquisitions that aren't yet accounted for in enterprise value, making halcon proportionately even cheaper.",

"Reinsurers have been looking toward the Japan treaty renewals at 1st April to push back on prices. Japan for this season has been fairly benign for cat losses (so you can see where that argument goes between the reinsurers and the clients) though attritional loss across various classes has been on the rise.   Issue with Japan treaty is its a market that reinsurers clamour to take a part in and so over capacity becomes an issue.  The major insurers here can then cherry pick through the security and/or quoted terms. The lead quoting markets need stick to their stance though they too are nervous about a reduce signing as they are under pressure income wise globally.I guess i would rank Everest Re as a middle tier market - they certainly would be best off concentrating on the insurance products side of the fence.In the last few years the China Insurers have also been dabbling with reinsurance - though they are backed by fairly larger groups in their market but tend to find a lower acceptance across international buyers  -  though again its added 'reinsurance capacity' to an already wide pool  -  they certainly have not broken onto the 'international scene' though China Re's Lloyds (as in an operation in London) arrangement in 2014 points to that they'll grow ......... my belief is you'll have maybe 2 China carriers that will take reinsurance to an international stage eventually (you could see the government pushing for globally recognized companies in so called respected industries).  The Japanese companies have done that but only through acquisitions and then generally by retaining that acquired companies name.I've thought for a while that Aspen would be acquired by a Japanese carrier - either MSIG or NKSJ - though from memory MSIG acquired a player in the last 2 years so that's less likely to happen.  NKSJ as a company has a more modern thinking than a Tokio or MSIG but for some reason they trail their rivals in this 'acquisition' spaceSwiss Re and Munich Re.  2 behemoths of the industry.  It still sounds like the newish Insurance direct marketing side has its issues in penetrating the insurance field for Swiss Re - from memory Munich Re were slightly ahead of them.  I'm not sure, from an investment standpoint, either of them is worth writing about.   Swiss Re is certainly trying some novel ideas with the recent investment collaboration with Japan's Softbank ( Feb 2018 )  -  apologies perhaps my wordology isn't great  -  and it will be interesting to watch and see where that goes.  Again from investment standpoint there is better place to put money, or so it seems.Apologies for my long comment.

why is Wall Street and big investors so negative about gassy stocks like Apache and Devon?  I thought natural gas was good?  I am not talking about gas generated by flatulent human beings which is disgusting; but rather the clean gas that comes out of Mother Earth,
So if Harris is correct......if you buy Apache at $34/35 today the North Sea and Egypt are worth $34 so you are getting everything else for free......WOW!    The market can be inefficient but I call BS on this...........,
"8 months ago there was an article: Apache's depressed stock could double July 8 2017. Stock price has only deteriorated since then but the fundamentals have not. So maybe the idea of Hassis Associates who further increased position by the way, is still valid.her some excerpts of the article:""But some well-regarded stockpickers are quietly scooping up Apache shares, on the expectation that they could double from a recent $45. Harris Associates, parent of Oakmark Funds, and Davis Funds substantially increased their stakes in the first quarter. Says Tony Coniaris, a manager of the Oakmark Select fund: “We believe value will ultimately be realized, either by the market or by a buyer.” ON A SUM-OF-THE-PARTS BASIS, however, Apache shines. Consider its 1.3 million acres in the Permian Basin. Based on Harris Associates’ assessment of 25 private acquisitions in the Permian area since petroleum prices began falling, the core acreage alone could be worth $20 billion, or about $50 a share. That’s more than Apache’s entire market value (see table). Then there are the Egypt and North Sea properties, worth about $34 a share, and Alpine High, which many analysts currently peg at $15 a share. Subtract net debt of $18 a share and you get an asset value of $81, 80% above last week’s price. Davis Funds, for its part, believes Apache is worth around $90, according to Kent Whitaker, a portfolio manager.",
"I just took a position today. Market not happy with production levels which is understandable.  However, balance sheet strengthening and decent asset base. Decent company, just not best of breed.  Hopefully management has been managing Mr Market's expectations with all of the ""negatives"".",
Very good analysis. You have a way of using the data to come up with your own conclusions rather than relying totally on a company’s management to misdirect or mislead you.,
"Production has been flat, but management have repeatedly stated that this has been the intention. And, LT, it's better to sell at $65 than $55, or whatever.",
"I am not understanding the negative articles which are coming out concerning Apache.  Management has been working on Alpine High for several years as they carefully studied the land formations, acquired the land and drilling rights, and commenced drilling.  It has all of the marks of a company looking for the long term; it does not want to be a flash in the pan.  I am long APA; I would like the analysts to be right when they project a price of $55 in the next year.  In the meantime, I continue to buy as the price remains at these two year lows.Just a thought or two.",

"in the most recent earnings conference call, management indicated that the percentage of oil in Alpine High should grow over time and that they were fairly confident with that.",

These are not big city guys .You have to cut them some slack.Look at the sec fillings. Several officers  converted 2020 options into stock recently.

The company has tried to respond line by line. They have also sued  and were upheld by people who made false claims. I doubt if they could do a lot more. A CC is not a place to read a long list of accusations and then rebut each. In fact if you listen to earlier cc they have at times done this.3.What they did do on this CC was confirm the number of new hires in marketing. Keep in mind that after 6 months or so a salesman is good for about l million in sales. Management again confirmed the guidance for 2018.4.If you look at recent SEC filings you will also see that senior management have also converted more options into shares so that they are in fact buying more equity. Granted at lower prices .The point is that they are putting good money into the company.Overall, in my view the CC did what it was supposed to. Your characterization of the CC as poorly run does not hold true.If you want a line by line rebuttal go to their website.Time will tell. To evaluate a firm like this you need to understand both the science behind the product and the quality and experience of the management.

"FTAgree that any issue with MDXG could be a localized one not a systemic one. Keep in mid that the ceo has previously sold two or three companies to larger firms.

Moreover, since the Va sales as best I remember were never more than about 25% of total revenue if that, any issue was contained in that area and since they are now selling directly, it has probably been eliminated. Overall this is a very interesting company as you have suggested. Yes I'm long. SC",
What’s your opinion on PLX and NVO?,
Pgnx is different SGYP   SgYP is one drug company and mgt are being sued with NO TRUST !!!! PGNX has multiple possibilities - so analogy is different. SGYP selling at $1.96 is worth $4.50 - $5.50 in a sale Which they may have to do !PGNX is worth much more if ALLPotential realized !!!,
is blrx the one that owns a piece of ast?,
Does BLRX have any competitors for the AGI-134 and BL-8040? Is there any company who's testing drugs for the same target diseases and might beat them to it?,
Thanks for the mention!,
"""we believe that MDXG under $8 - and following an over 50% drop - is a buy"".Not in my world it is.  CAUTION is the watchword here.  While I agree with your assessement of the products, the company is a hot mess.

"TFT -- Your New Team has many picks for many SDIs. With the addition of Team-S, you've closed the loop with picks for those also interested in speculating. I've made my share of speculative investments (and unfortunately, also a few that moved from relatively safe to speculative). IMO speculation 'done right' involves discipline--spreading X% of one's portfolio across 4 or 5 positions, while fully expecting 2 or 3 positions to become TR failures; 1 or 2 positions will likely survive and perform modestly; and if lucky--1 of the 5 positions will become a 10-bagger.SDI are not likely to become wealthy speculating...most cannot/should not logically allocate so large an investment devoted to risk/reward speculations that success is likely to will make a significant difference in their net worth. Speculative positions often have very high betas, and require close monitoring to know which price changes are important, and which to ignore. As I'm in the late stages of removing excess risk from my portfolio, I no longer engage in speculative investments.  Nonetheless, setting aside X% of one's portfolio for speculation keeps the juices flowing when much of the action trends toward boring.Rich-unck:12hrs.p.s.

The 37% market share link has only 2 years growth numbers. That will tell us if Roku can maintain the leadership position or not.  Thanks.,

"Above I mentioned that short interest in ROKU rose to over 30% over the past month as the share price rose unexpectedly. At the moment its 35%. This writer at Dow Jones agrees, saying Roku became, ""One of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq,"" after rising far above its IPO price of $14.00. Now the question is, what will the share price do between now and the end of summer months? I personally believe that the answer lies with the company PR division. If they promote the company, provide news and information on a regular basis, maintain public interest, the share price will likely stay at least 2X the IPO and rise eventually to over the most recent high of $58.00.""How Roku Came Up Short""By Dan Gallagher 12:44 PM ET 2/22/18 | Dow Jones""Roku, the maker of TV streaming boxes went public in late September and was an immediate hit. It's first quarterly report as a public company six weeks later fueled the fire even more, sending the stock into the stratosphere. Roku's share price more than doubled soon after and closed out the year above $50; it had listed for $14. Dangerous ground, as it turned out. That post-earnings surge put Roku's stock price well above the $28 median price target set by analysts, most of whom are extremely optimistic and are employed by the banks who underwrote the IPO. Short-sellers pounced. Prior to the company's fourth-quarter results Wednesday, more than one-third of Roku's public float had been sold short -- making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq. The shares thus fell sharply Thursday following Roku's latest report, which contained a first-quarter revenue outlook that was below what the Street expected.""Good luck all!",
"Roku's business: When your competitors are Apple TV, Google's Chromecast, and Amazon's FireTV, good luck to you. Moreover, this space is so cheap to enter their margins will get crushed by bunch of Chinese knock-offs.I agree with most analysts this will probably end up like GoPro and Fitbit. People thinking this is gonna be the Netflix are delusional. Netflix has to spend insane amount of money to create original contents just to have its moat up. What moat does Roku have?

The reality is that the revenue loss from the cigar butt portions of the Valeant portfolio are well-documented and expected.   B&L is the anchor position, and Salix continues to get healthier with the reorganization of the sales unit.   If there is a battle ground between bulls and bears at this point, it's related to the Salix portion of Valeant's porfolio.    I don't have a position at the moment.

Management previously forecast 8-10% revenue growth CAGR for Branded Rx segment through to 2020. If that is still their view then it should manifest in the 2018 guidance as a big positive surprise vs expectations. The forecast of 4-6% CAGR for B&L/Int'l will likely be at the top end based on how things have been going recently. Fx will be a significant tailwind now in 2018.--> Big upside surprise in 2018 guidance is coming in the ER today IMHO.,

"If there is one thing that consistently rings true about finance forums and the associated public comments  by users  is that the analysis and commentary is camped at opposite corners in the zone of extremity.     By this ,    I mean that if one looks at the opinions and price projections  they are very much lumped into the least likely to occur zones,    they are at the extremes that are the most unlikely to actually transpire.     The bears  overstate the negatives while ignoring the positives,  while  the bulls overstate  the positives while ignoring the negatives .     Such lack of moderating naturally leads to price projections that are the least likely to be realized ,   when reality bears its inexorable effect.   Little wonder is it that options market makers are amongst the richest and most profitable ventures known to man.

Investors should consider this report as only a singlefactor in making their investment decision.We are upgrading Valeant to Overweight, ahead of earnings Tuesday.VRX 2025 bonds have traded off 5-6 points in the last couple of months,but we aren’t expecting negative surprises for 4Q results or the outlook for2018.At the time of our last comment on VRX we said we thought sellsideequity estimates were too high. That’s still a bit of a worry, based onBloomberg consensus a little above $3.3bn. We feel that’s been a little derisked, however, by a couple of more recent equity analysts citing a figuremore in line with our own $3.1bn estimate. We’re thinking creditexpectations may be more muted in late February than was the case twomonths ago.We also feel a bit better about our own estimate. We previously neglectedto account for the decline in the US dollar, which will be a tailwind forValeant this year as its OUS earnings will translate into about $75mm moreEBITDA, we figure. The US dollar has continued to weaken YTD.Valeant’s presentation at our Healthcare Equity conference in earlyJanuary was, we figure, a good preview of how it will frame its 2018-2019outlook. Namely, that the firm has delivered on its debt reductioncommitment, the stabilization and turnaround has traction, and investorscan look forward to numerous catalysts from new products. The companyframes seven of such new products as its Significant Seven, with acombined revenue opportunity of $1bn. These aren’t going to be bigcontributors this year, but we have confidence that they’ll be an importantoffset to LOE headwinds through 2019.JPMorgan’s high yield Index is off about 35 bps YTD; 6.45% vs 6.1% atJanuary 1. Valeant 2025 bonds are 90-100 bps cheaper. Some of thedecline may be linked to the lower stock price, down almost 25% from itsearly January peak. Management has commented that all options are opento set the company on the right path for growth – including equity. Wehave increasingly convinced ourselves that equity would be wisestrategically. It’s not so much that a reduction in leverage of 0.25-0.50xwould be monumental. It’s that equity might be seen as a milestone in thecompany’s turnaround, establishing that access to capital, de-risking theequity story, and potentially an addition to Valeant’s growth profile if useof proceeds helps facilitate inorganic growth.We’ll be revisiting our outlook after the company’s earnings, but in themeantime our 2018 model and preliminary 2019 FCF/leverage thoughtsremain substantially in-line with our January note, linked above.",

"The interest din't go down the whole way, because debt was renegotiated at slightly higher rates - it is down though, just not as much as you say.Still I believe there's a beat in the offing this week - should get above $20 easily enough.Also, @browndlee's comment, if they can get debt down to ~$24B, there's really somewhere between $6-$9B as stated before by management that they really need to reduce by in order to get to a comfortable longer-term debt level (of $15-$18B) - if they're working at about $1.5-$2B/year reduction - thats not that long until VRX is in pretty darn good shape.No more diversification, no more equity raise likely; and probably one or two more debt refinancing to spread the big hits coming in 3-5 years out a little further, so they don't have years with $5B+ to pay off in a chunk. With the interest rates rising a bit more this year, I would have to believe creditors would be only too happy to get a slightly higher return on the current fixed income repayments most of the debt is making today.",

SE, on the other hand, is like a hunter lost in the winter woods who comes upon a set of footprints and follows them knowing they will lead to safety; in time, more and more footprints join until he's following a well-traveled road. Only too late does he discover he's been walking in circles. Sorry, SE, I'm done reading your articles.",
"I think this is one of SE's more balanced pieces.  I think his point about closing the asset sales at the end of the quarter is a valid one since it shows quarter end debt (which reflects the debt paydown from the asset sales) but they get to keep the EBITDA from the sold assets from the quarter.  It definitely makes things look better than they otherwise would.Having said that, I think the company is well followed and the news and quarter are baked into the price at this point.  I think the downside risk is that the 2018 guidance is heavily sandbagged (like last year) which the market should be prepared for, but who knows.I think the real risk is still to the upside.  For instance, they have stated several times that they are looking at small tuck in acquisitions.  If they were able to announce even a small product acquisition that fits seamlessly into their rebuilt salesforce's sweet spot, this could move the stock up.  From here on out, it is all about sales growth.  The easy lifting on debt paydown by selling assets is likely over.  If the new products sell well and they can tuck in some additional products at the right price, the stock is headed higher.  If they don't get revenue growth, they are still not out of the woods IMO.  I am long the stock basically because Papa & Co. have shown they can operate and deliver.  My bet is they keep making progress.",
"This strikes me as one of your more serious efforts as it has better balance. However, I believe the way to analyze their quarter will be ex divestitures. So Q4 2016 was revenue of $2.403 billion and EBITDA (non GAAP) was $1.045 billion. There have been public filings that give some clarity on revenue and EBITDA from divested units, but it’s still incomplete, so it requires some assumptions. All the major divestitures were part of Q4 2016 figures. It appears the divested units produced around $1.1 billion of annualized revenue and $385 million of EBITDA. Adjusting a little for seasonality Q4 2016 revenue ex divestitures was around $2.15-2.2 billion and EBITDA around $955 million. Viewed in that fashion the underlying growth is roughly offsetting LOE’s. If the LOE’s decline rapidly in 2018-2020 and new and existing product sales show continued strength YOY comparisons will begin to look very good. Also of note will be the size of the writedowns related to Sprout and the new tax bill. Also, how long will the present tax shield last with reduced deductibility of interest payments.",
"""VRX bulls would almost have you believe Valeant is a growth company.

"it's only ~$35bn and interests will increase due to junk rating.... truly insignificant indeed just tell me how will the company grow? through first-to-file generics? haha IMHO, it will be a LONG way (years) till the stock sees a decent upward move. The question is are you willing to wait that long and is it worth it over other opportunities?",
"They still in very interesting situation and have to be managed right, but if they get their biosimilar of herceptin on the world market anytime soon they will make huge profits. According to Oncology drugs sales figures herceptin even in 2017 was a top 4 selling drug. They need little luck with new clinical trials, they have to be disciplined investors and good managers of this very extensive and expensive business, but to deny that they can’t grow from current levels of stock back to 30-40 dollars range would be silly in my opinion",

"One additional comment about the above. While the issues discussed by some are very real, in the context of Michael Webb's January article, http://bit.ly/2FJzfuk, the company transparently conceded that the roll-out would be slow, with critical profits not plausible until 2019-20.  But once the post-marketing study is at least partly addressed, and production capability clarified, it will become a significant competitor. The cardiac issues/complications are somewhat exaggerated, while the diabetic applications are being underplayed. Combined with its faster dosing aspect, and improved efficacy, it may become the dominant product of choice in the long-run, with that implied financial potential.Maybe the floor is in around 16, or maybe the remaining float will be manipulated down a bit more, but its long-term future as an established player is now assured  Any pipeline success gives DVAX the potential to become a big-time company or takeover candidate. The existing institutional holders aren't sitting quietly on all those shares for no good long-term reason.",
"I've been reading the last several comments with great concern, and respect, after the stock price fell out of bed today (along with several others). With approval finally accomplished after three attempts, it's not possible that the company has thought realistically about the production and marketing? In reality, these are highly qualified and experienced professionals who finally achieved approval for the first major improvement in Hep-B vaccine technology in something like four decades.""BERKELEY, CA and DUSSELDORF, GERMANY, Dec 09, 2009 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX News Network) -- Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: DVAX) announced today that its GMP manufacturing facility in Duesseldorf, Germany has been approved for the commercial production of hepatitis B surface antigen, a key component of HEPLISAV(TM), the Company's investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine. The approval comes as a result of an upgrade expanding production capacity. With an updated European Union GMP manufacturing license in place, Dynavax can meet the initial commercial production demands for the anticipated launch of HEPLISAV.""Note:  http://bit.ly/2FDzoiE",
"unless this company CEO changes his attitude the company will be hung out to dry .  you can speculate which major PLC I'm on the pay roll of but until Dynavax can produce commercial scale batches and actually sell it there won't be profit just further stock dilution loans etc that will make SGYP etc look like credible companies.  I'm seriously amazed no analyst has ever raised the ability to produce product as a consideration.  ask fast Eddi on the next ""fire side chat"" PS he doesn't have a clue how to deliver a return to the share holders paying his wages!",
"Careful about the loan, until we get to read the loan document. CRG loans have historically had performance milestones the company has to hit before the money can be borrowed. See OMER and SGYP.",
"DVAX valuation is hardly reflecting Hep B Vaccine potential only, let alone TRL9 agonist in cancer and TLR and in COPD. In fact Hep B Vaccine , which is a reality now, could represent a tiny fraction of what may come from cancer and COPD. If SD101 can double Pembrolizumab efficacy (as first melanoma results seem to imply) and possibly make 'cold' tumors 'hot' (like for breast cancer) then the combo will become standard of care across the board in many if not all cancer types, fetching tens of USD billions in sales annually.

my post has been up for a few hours and Surprised guy and his  other trolls that might be on Dynavax payroll havent bothered to comment ? Funny that ?,
"Dynavax need a new production facility big enough to produce Hepslav in commercial scale batches and even if this started tomorrow it will still take at least  2+ years or more to get the new facility built and registered with the FDA , i wil let you speculate how much this will cost as  Hillerod has a very limited capability and even if run flat out will only generate $41m of prodct IMHO.  Given all the c**k ups by DVAX in the past i think VBIV will get their product registered and FDA approved without the need for an ongoing study as they have already got 500,000 patients and approval in 14.  VBIV also have income.  Myself included thought this stock would have made $30 easily after approval but further share dilution has devided share holder confidence and a cozy fire side chat will not make up for the lack of a partnership (joint venture) or revenue.",
For a small biotech - the selling and marketing expenses are a big burden - also getting experienced people from BP is not easyThat is why the buyout option is always attractive as current investors get full benefits immediately and BP take over ling term risks,
"In my opinion, the stock price would have appreciated exponentially if Merck acquired Dynavax.  This leads me to wonder if folks are hesitant because of the efforts of a sales force as well as potential supply. If SD 101 is looking good in the future, maybe then Merck will buy Dynavax at a much higher price.  If supply for Heplisav can be met, I see know reason why DVAX conservatively can’t go to $30 in 2018.",
this co has a proven track record for not delivering or meeting any of its key dates.,
"All the pieces are in place except an effective CEO John. Gray may be the titanic for DVAX. He refuses to monetize HepB effectively, the companies most important asset by far. His ""fire side chat"" clarifies that more. He leaves the door open for the competitors to shut the door on HepB.  He is spending 2018 rolling out the product and may be 2019 and beyond waiting for CDC prime approval. It goes on and on. For me it is about time to take a good sized hit I will be taking and sell and move on to another product with a better run company.",
its deferred share holder dilution as its still cash raised from recent share holder dilution that will be used to service this loan.  good luck to all the longs but another 7 + years before you see a credible return is crazy,
Also as far as the loan goes I am much happier to see management do that for its share holders then issuing more shares (dilution) at the share price level it is at now.  Issuing shares instead of taking the loan would have instantly diluted share holder value to a level most likely below where we are now.  The old saying is true it takes money to make money and in the world of biotech's it takes a lot of money to make money on these newly approved drugs.  GLTA,
I really have nothing to add other than there is a LOT of Speculation in the above comments as to what is holding this price down and I have not read anything new in any of those comments to make me consider that all or any of them are correct.  The fact is No One knows why the share price is being held back but with all the news coming out this year from DVAX with regards to their pipeline and the launching of Heplisav B I look for the share price to eventually rise again.  SD101 looks promising but more studies are being done as I am writing this and the results of some of those studies will be released and talked about this year.  Should be an interesting year for DVAX but unless it is as obvious as the nose on your face you will drive yourself nuts trying to figure out any reason a share price does not rise when it should.  This is the dynamics of the stock market and it has always been this way.  GLTA,
"Regardless of ""preferential treatment,"" ""best-in-class,"" ""king of the mountain,"" or whatever term one might proclaim, the issue always will be commercializing. If they can't get the drug to the patient, nothing else matters. Unfortunately, that is often the result. BTW: I am long $DVAX.",
"I would submit that the past performance of Dynavax is part of the problem with the share price.  The steps leading up to the FDA approval were less than satisfactory.  I am not sure that the management has the necessary skill set to make the company succeed.  I am troubled by the fumbles in getting the drug approved, the dilution of the shares, and large loan recently taken out. Excellence in research and development of new drugs is not a guarantee that those skills will be the needed ones to take the company into the cutthroat world of marketing drugs.  A major reason for failure of new businesses is that the entrepreneur that can develop a better mousetrap is unable or unwilling to be able to take it to the next level.Just a thought or two.",
And what exactly is SA track record? Very little correlation between SA and stock prices.IMO SA just another form of pump and dump advertising.,
"A very good article touching all the salient points.  You may be right regarding the markets unappreciation for the new DVAX position; it’s cash on hand, credit facility, oncology pipeline, and pending Hepislav-B rollout.  I’m a shareholder and disappointed too in the share price.  But wondering if Mr. Market has less an unnappreciation but rather a healthy dose of pending risks.  I was hoping you and others could comment.  PharmaSystems raises one good point about manufacturing concerns, but I’m guessing that is solved by the cash and the credit facility, and the fact that the initial demand will likely not outstrip it’s ability to deliver with existing inventory or their ability to manufacture more.  Frankly though it would be disappointing to learn this was true, it would be better than the alternative and a ‘good’ problem to have.  So I’m not so much worried about product availability that PharmaSystems may have, though again it’s something I had not considered.But this is what worries me and was looking for feedback.  I believe that Mr. Market, by a large %, was looking for a partnership deal, or a an acquisition, post approval, I know I was.  These guys have never rolled out product worldwide, never developed a large sales force.  And to PharmaSystems point, never had to manufacture on the scale they need to.  Those are likely the headwinds that Mr. Market sees ahead, and not necessarily the lack of appreciation for the progress and the position they are now.  Secondly, again looking for feedback, I think the post-marketing study may be seriously hanging over head.  Where I may have hoped for an acquisition post FDA approval, or a serious partnership, who would do that if in 3 years, there is risk that Hepislav-B takes a hit.  And in what form?  Pulled from the shelves?  New black label warning?  You have to believe that the GSK sales force is letting all these institutions aware of this ‘black cloud’, at least as this sales force will depict it.  That’s what a good competitive sales force does, sow doubt in the competition.  And why not?  The CDC itself basically has done the work for GSK and Energix-B by NOT awarding it ‘preferential treatment’.  And the GSK salesforce will dwarf DVAX salesforce, well, forever..  so that risk and this ‘cloud’ has the potential to linger until such time that the post marketing study is completed.  And it must be unequivocally positive or it’s trouble.Finally, and this also touches on this study, there is a company that already has a HEP B vaccine in Israel and a few other European countries, currently being marketed, ( similar to Egenerix, it is administered in 3 doses).  Company symbol is VBIV.  However, it is currently approved to be administered to the immuno-suppressed population, perhaps even more so than Hepislav-B, including pediatric patients (or they may be looking for label expansion to pediatrics, on that I’m not entirely sure).  But the point is, this vaccine is already being marketed and they are currently in a phase III trial here in the US, scheduled to conclude in, I believe, 2019.So 2 things.  If hepislav-b passes the post marketing trial, and the VBIV trial (I think drug is called Sci-B?) also get approval, then not only will DVAX need to compete with GSK, but also now VBIV.  And from a product standpoint, Sci-B will compete pretty well considering the immune-suppressed market it will pursue, not unlike DVAX.  3 doses vs. 2.  Yes, big advantage to DVAX, but another unforeseen competitor in the market place beyond just the big gorilla, is not good.  But worse, if the DVAX trial has poor results, and is forced to but a warning on their label, that becomes a more than serious problem to compete with.  The competitive sales forces, both VBIV and GSK, will frame the sale as 3 doses or potential heart attack.  Regardless of the realities, that’ s what the hospitals and doctors will here. So it’s my belief that the share price and Mr. Market is paying a lot of attention to this post marketing study, and the potential for yet another competing vaccine, and if and when DVAX passes their Post marketing trial, a competitor who’s product already is better than ENERGIX-B.So having said all that, if DVAX was a one trick pony and Hepislav-B was it, I’d have sold already with a very nice profit.  I think its oncology platform holds a lot more potential, and is why I’m still here, for the moment anyway.  Thoughts?Thoughts?",
John - good articleHave you seen the big news on Standford finding on mice study of SD101 with BMS OX-40 combo - some crazy results - also CEO did not talk about the new study registeredhttp://bit.ly/2t09we6Any views?,
"Great article John.  Eddie is rightly focused on demonstrating as much value as possible from Heplisav and the oncology pipeline in the near-term.  The credit facility and recent sub-licensing agreement with Merck (2/20 8-k) give me much higher confidence Dynavax can roll this out without any major roadblocks.  At sub-$18/share, it's clear the market is discounting Heplisav's prospects significantly.  While I don't know if $500m/yr is realistic, the market seems to view it as $200m/yr at best.  Not to mention the entire oncology portfolio, which appears to have very little value baked in at all.My humble opinion: a non-botched rollout of Heplisav, working towards+/- $20m of Heplisav revenue in Yr1, and positive SD101 data in Q2 will move Dynavax to a $2 billion enterprise value in short order.  Promising oncology data could lead to a strong premium on top of that in a buyout scenario.  PT $35-45 by end of 2018.  GL.",
Hi JohnYet another good article however a couple of questions:Why did the CEO earlier this year state they had enough cash from the last share dilution to to take them through to 2019 and then decide to take a loan at 9.5 % to raise a further £100m that has to be serviced from share holder cash.There is also the ability to actually produce product to sell .  As far as i know production ceased in Q2 ish 2016 and any stock piled product from 2015 is rapidly approaching its shelf life expiry date.  Every one takes for granted that Hepslav is a product that Dynavax can produce but i have heard no evidence to support that production has resummed.  From memory the facility in Hillerod had a very limited ability to produce pruct and certainly not in the volume required to support the potential sales figures needed for this company to service it's loan commitments and ongoing R&D.  Either way the share price is still a long way off its post approval and additional share dilution price of nearly $24.  I agree potentially an under valued share but also still a very risky stratergy is being taken by the company.,

Many would agree my criticism & skepticism  was warranted  given the consistent failures by management to make real breakthroughs and all the while IR providing some conflicting messages on an individualized basis over the phone. Those are some bad practices the company needs to cease following immediately and start provide regular update to all investors  in a timely manner via  a conf. call or company's web site etc.I expect stock to remain volatile until the news of deal/no deal is announced.

"Mr. Engle-- thanks for the update, although not a lot of news (which isn't  a criticism of you -- it just is what it is).  That said, I have a few comments:""We also touched on competitive threats. The only new entrant on the horizon is the generic being developed by Teva (TEVA). It is under active review by the FDA, but Teva has been quiet about it for some time. It had planned to commercialize early this year, but that now seems less likely. It may fail to win approval.""1) Flather's opinion regarding the commercialization of TEVAs generic is necessarily biased (if he wants to hold onto his job) -- and he certainly has no objective evidence about if, and when, this competitor of Symjepi might arrive on the market.  What we do know objectively is that it is being actively reviewed by the FDA.  Bottomline, Flather's opinion here is not useful information."" But even if it is approved, the generic’s economic value may be limited thanks to downward pressure on the branded EpiPen. Symjepi, on the other hand, has always aimed to be positioned as a low-cost alternative. ""2) IMO, ANY generic competition to Symjepi, coming to market in the near term (perhaps even before Symjepi) is a serious handicap for ADMP in negotiating with a partner""Adamis has narrowed the field down to two contenders, and each is doing end-stage due diligence.""3)  This isn't quite accurate -- Carlo said that the process is still ongoing and they are in discussions with two groups, and ""Each group is engaged in what we believe are later stages of diligence, which may include discussions with potential drug buyers, wholesalers and distributors,""My point here is that the actual statements of Carlo don't give me the impression he really knows for sure what the two groups are doing.  If they had actually told him they were in ""end-stage due diligence"" (as you say), why would he not just say so?  My interpretation of his entire update is that he is giving his educated guess, but he in fact has no concrete evidence of what stage of DD there are in, or how serious they are as contenders."" That is good news insofar as it tells us that there has been some material movement toward a final deal.""4) again, this is an over-reach -- Due Diligence is just that -- it may lead the potential partners to conclude the party is over.  No information presented by management gives us a clue regarding the disposition of this so called due diligence on the part of the interested parties"" It is true that there is always a risk that neither deal will materialize, but it seems highly unlikely that either party now involved would simply back out after coming this far. ""5) again, we have no clue from Flather's or Carlo's statements ""how far the parties have come "".  And again, coming to the end of DD may in fact bring the parties to conclude that the party is over.",

Maybe this apprehension gets him nervous in dealing with partners and that is the main reason for the delay and he is just hoping that they will force a deal to happen with him stepping away?  I am worried that he may be scared of taking calls and having meetings.   If so, as investors we should confront the problem and him the poor guy.

The reason I say its ""ok"" and not great is because the streams were only in 720, not 1080 or 4k and sometimes the streams lagged or buffered (but this was rare). When I watch football on the TV I am used to 1080 so watching in 720 was a big step down. I hope that they improve the quality of the streams in the future. However, the channel lineup was perfect for watching college football as it had all the channels I watch: ABC, ESPN, and the Big 10 Network. Good value at $35 a month, as I'm locked in at that price even though they increased it to $40.",
The new platform design for YouTube is frustratingly difficult to navigate.,
Google has other advantageous with YouTube TV over competitors.   A big one is they already have the infrastructure with regular YouTube to leverage.My biggest problem with Vue and Sling was the cloud lag you do not get if you are use to a Tivo.   Google with YouTube TV has somehow figured out how to get it perform as a local solution but still be cloud based.  I suspect the YouTube existing infrastructure and their excellent CDN is how they were able to do it.So Google will have less infrastructure cost.But then on the revenue side Google has the data to make ads more valuable.   You are logged into your Google account and therefore can target ads better than anyone in the world.http://bit.ly/2q7rUAENobody else is close or has the type of data Google has to leverage.Then Google knows what ads you saw where others do not.  They can then use targeted ads with search and other properties based on what ad you saw watching linear TV.   Google knows what ad played when and your account.   Plus Google even knows where you went after you saw the ad.The advertising industry traditionally has flied blind and had little opportunity to improve.    Here Google can close the loop and optimize like never before.Then in addition YouTube TV is just an excellent product and would say now the #1 Google product passing Google Photos and Google WiFi.,
Chromecast is in an estimated 25 million homes so that another excellent addition.,
YouTube could easily be a $100B asset in 10 years or less...,
"YouTube TV claims ""Watch live TV without cable"". The problem with Cable TV isn't the cable, it's the content, as well as the business model. I have zero interest in watching network television with it's constant barrage of commercial interruptions, that are artificially organized into linear ""channels"" and shown on someone else's schedule. That's a 20th-century business model that has no place or future in the 21st.  Adding a DVR ""feature"" doesn't change this.Per the FAQ, ""YouTube TV is available in most metro area locations around the United States"". So the potential market is a fraction of the US and zero International. How is that of interest from an investment standpoint? Meantime the author is projecting its potential ""7-10 years out"". In 7-10 years the whole broadcast/cable TV model will be dead, so this is trying to squeeze the last few dollars out of a dying medium. I wouldn't count on this to generate any meaningful revenue for Google, especially in the longer term.For those who aren't yet ready to wean themselves from network TV, and don't want to pay for Cable, get a digital antenna and watch for free.",
Very nice article. I’ve been on the sidelines on google (admittedly for no good reason other than price per share) but am considering adding on next significant dip if there is one.,
"I signed up for YouTube TV 2 months ago after A) cutting my cable TV cord and B) doing a Hulu TV trial.I'm impressed with the UI, particularly on the iPhone, and how well it works with ChromeCast on the large screen.  The DVR is awesome.  I recorded every Olympic event with a single click.  The unlimited DVR is pretty powerful - coupled with 6 simultaneous screen views - its far better than the others that I've tried.It's missing a couple of my go to entertainment channels (History/Discovery) but I'm hopeful that's not far off - the Turner channels is a nice add.I'm also hoping they can build in some TIVO like features where it records programs it thinks you'll like based on your watch behavior (AI).Long GOOGL",

Adj EPS $0.67: 24% beat.  Rev $278.5MM: 1.5% beat. Comps 4%. Cash +$4.4MM.  Debt -$5MM.  The bar is full of peeps. Stock is up 12.3% today to $55.65.,
i think you are ignoring the cash flow here.  BJRI is basically a conservatively levered public LBO.  they are using their prodigious cash flow to aggressively reduce the share count.  I would not be surprised to see them do $150m of adjusted EBITDA within the new few years.  This could trade for 10x adjusted EBITDA less about $150m of net debt and divided by 18m shares gets you to about $75 per share.  They have smartly slowed unit growth down to drive comp sales and traffic.  They are pulling back on discounting and continuing Project Q cost savings to restore margins.  Clearly this is not a slam dunk to happen but i would not bet against this company.  There have been several buyouts in the restaurant industry and BJRI could be one of them.,
"????I think that there are a lot of positive fundamentals for this relative modern restaurant.   Especially low debt, good cash flow, and a positive tax policy that will add to profits.The way they have reduced share count which will accelerate now that they are slowing the addition of new restaurants to me is very positive.  Also a little dividend was added last quarter.  good cash flow and I believe profits will grow especially per share maybe faster than the last 10 years at 16% per year average profit growth.

The one thing I really hope is that FB start introducing a payment service (alipay, wechat pay) or money wiring (western union) service across Asia and Africa - around 5.8 Billion people combined, Asia alone has 60% of the world population, so logically speaking, FB should put more focus on Asia and Africa. Ant financial (Alipay) is worth about $100 Billion - about 25% of FB's market cap, its revenue double last year and expanding across Asia rapidly.

The Local Line business component of Windstream will continue to incur losses as users flock to cable.  The SDWAN initiative is really to leverage spending less money on their own network. That makes sense as they just don't have the cash to upgrade their own equipment needs. They  will likely win against Aurelius but not before losing more cash defending themselves.

In their 10-K, Tesla management has clearly stated they can remain in business with no new capital or debt raises by making various adjustments to their operations. PriceWaterhouse must agree with Tesla management's statement, because PriceWaterhouse did not require a clear statement that either a capital or debt raise is necessary for the company to remain in business.Given the above, Tesla can still raise all the capital and/or debt they desire, and, shareholders and debtholders can expect that 100% of all new capital and/or debt funds raised will be used only for new projects. Since PriceWaterhouse, with intimate knowledge of Tesla's history, still affirmed that no new capital or debt raises are needed for on-going operations (salaries, G&A, paying outstanding bills, etc.), I'm confident PriceWaterhouse will require 100% of any new funds be fully, and clearly, tied to specific projects in Tesla's financial statements, in an on-going basis, so investors can easily see how the funds are being used.

That does not fit with the numbers shown. The second is that as others, have noted, most esp. Bill Cunningham, Tesla doesn't really have outstanding credit lines of 2 billion. Nor does it have much in the way of collateral with which to secure new draws. Remember, it just about cleaned out its US lease portfolio. Bill's right. They're running out of collateral. The third is that I believe that Tesla's ability to ramp Model 3 production is not just restricted to the ability to get production speed up and pay for the parts, but to the ability of the underlying service/delivery structure to support the increase in production. Taking those three observations together, it seems very unlikely to me that Tesla does have that much discretionary ability to slow cap ex. If they fail to ramp, they pay much more for parts/penalties. If they ramp successfully, then they have to spend quite a bit for the infrastructure to support the ramp. If they ramp enough, then perhaps they can generate collateral to be used in drawing down credit. That is why everyone believes that Tesla MUST raise capital to keep going. However, even if one does not accept my conclusions, these numbers make it clear that Tesla will raise capital and spend capital in order to obtain the growth that was supposed to arise from the prior capital investments. This is why I think the long thesis is so hilariously wrong. What remains are merely the asset valuations of the stock - but the future was baked in there. The stock has already risen based on the Model 3 expectations, and the problem is that Tesla is stuck with the Model 3. It has to ramp up to something decent, and it can't really pledge to start something else in 2019 and 2020 before it shows that it is getting there. In the prior investment call that question was asked and answered - Tesla's planned cap ex this year is not for future projects, but to support ongoing. So investing more in Tesla is actually done to save the prior investments - to prevent it from going broke. Not for any forward growth. And if one is not buying forward growth in Tesla, then what ARE you buying?",
"The premise of this article is that the accounting rule requires prior disclosure of capital raises.  That premise is false. The accounting rule change simply doesn't require that. Note that the article didn't quote anything but simply misleadingly paraphrases the rule, and then writes the rest of the article outraged that there is no disclosure of a potential capital raise. What does the rule actually say? The accounting rule change only applies when there is a precedent condition, namely when ""substantial doubt is raised,"" that is, substantial doubt that ""conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.""  If there is no raising of substantial doubt, then the rule doesn't even get started. How do you figure out if there is substantial doubt? You look at an entity’s ability to meet its obligations, considering its liquidity sources including available liquid funds and available access to credit. Only if there is substantial doubt, and then that doubt is alleviated by plans for a capital raise or other cash infusion, does there need to be disclosure as to how that substantial doubt was alleviated through those capital or cash raise plans. See 205-40-55-3 and 205-40-50-01 through 50-5 and the flowchart on page 12 of the FASB Aug 2014 document.TSLA's burn rate needs to be offset enough by Tesla's cash pile, cash flow, and open credit, to avoid raising, not mere doubt, not short seller wishful thinking, but ""substantial doubt.""  Only if there is substantial doubt considering all those factors, does there need to be a discussion of mitigating factors such as a planned capital raise.  See the accounting firms' better discussion of this rule change.",
"I'm enjoying these threads also.It's kind of fun having been preached to for 4 years that some of us are mathematics incapable, don't know anything about financial statements and that the bears entire valuation argument relies on the published financials.And yet, here we have an entire article and set of posts basically saying that the financials are fraudulent, the auditing firm (PWC) is complicit and are fundamentally wondering why the financials presented don't line up with where the bears think the stock price ought to be.So the rationalization for the fact that the bears predictions are fundamentally wrong (to date) is that this is all a  poorly executed con and fraudulent.  Amusingly, the only shorts to date claiming gains are those who have been playing the down side of the volatility ratchet (and winning) as their claim to genius market ability.  Amusingly those betting on the upside of the volatility ratchet could claim the same genius as a long.  Which means in both cases that the traders just had well timed trades that coincided with direction and timing.  Nothing at all fundamental about a long or short case in that with a volatile stock.What a scary scary thought it must be if basically the financial reports are fundamentally valid numbers, and the stock price is what it is today.  If that is the case, then the bears would be saying to themselves, ""There's something I fundamentally don't understand about this with regards to my short because reality isn't coinciding with the way I think it should be because my idea of correct market valuation is the discounted cash flows to the present.  And there is no way I could have gotten that wrong because all my assumptions are valid and I guarantee I know what will occur!"" It couldn't possibly be the case that the numbers as reported are real, that they don't understand the company, don't know how investors value it,  have bad assumptions about outcomes, that short term winning trades on the long and short side of a volatile stock is just good timing, and that the stock price might just continue to increase, could it?Nahhhh!  That's crazy talk!So I guess the ""con job with complicit auditors"" delusion is as good as any.",
"Tesla will raise money this year and probably by Summer.  The Semi and roadster won't drop out of the sky.  It is also plausible that the Semi and roadster are typical Tesla announcement of the announcement of the announcement and no real effort will be made until 2019 or later.  Sorry VA, I know you believe Tesla will be producing the semi next year.",
"I think the last time the shorts trotted out the ""Going Concern"" pony, Tesla went on a massive bull run (most likely an epic short squeeze). I suspect their brokers are calling in more funds to backstop the losses, so here we go with these articles. There really is a stench of fear from the shorts lately.This is why I love SA for entertainment.",
"Great job, gator, thank you.A few thoughts. First, I believe a capital raise will happen this year. Tesla certainly left the door open that in several places, including in the section from which you quoted. (""We continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business."")Second, I'm not quite sure where you got your $2MM from for the unused part of the secured credit facility. The ABL facility amount is $1.825B. $1.11 was drawn as of 12/31, and another $138MM in letters of credit were outstanding (they count against the line), so that's $1.25B used, leaving another $580MM.Yes, there is potentially another $175MM available as Incremental Commitments under the line, but only if various collateral tests are met. Assume they are and we get to $755MM.Is there some other undrawn loan facility? Because right now, I'm coming up $1.25B south of your figure.Third, some $800MM+ of the cash came from Customer deposits. If there is a net drain on Customer deposits during 2018, which is at least plausible if not likely, the available cash shrinks by that net amount.Finally, I think it's likely Tesla will be able to refinance the debt that comes due. But, the cost of the new debt will likely be higher than the cost of the existing debt.Lots to think about here, and thank you for laying it out.",
"Tsla has a lot of escape clauses still. For example,1) If they need to raise money, they will claim its for building a production line for the semi, or the Y, or whatever else Elon dreams up. No need to have pre-announced that for going concern reasons.2) If they choose to instead reduce capex, why should it matter to the tsla lemmings? No amount of evidence can shake their faith.",
The only way the auditor gets in trouble is if Tesla files for bankruptcy this year and that's not going to happen.  2019 may pose a great enough risk that the auditor takes action.,
Maybe Tesla’s fundamentals are an exception to the rule. Maybe Tesla will forever lose money.,
"What additional information offers the article to investors? Mr. Market knows that the company is burning billions of cash and is going to burn more in 2018. Model 3 production issues are well known and won't abate anytime soon. The company needs outside capital to finance its business.Nothing new, I guess.Investors would be well served to focus on the three core themes at this point:1) Will the company be able to increase Model 3 production rates and margins over time? Sure.2) Will the Model 3 be a success? Obviously - hundreds of thousands of buyers are eagerly waiting for their cars.3) Does the company have access to the capital markets to cover ongoing losses and elevated capex requirements? Absolutely,As long as their products are in high demand, the share price will prosper regardless of missed projections, heavy cash usage and botched production ramps.It would take a major flop for Tesla to get into problems and there's nothing like this on the horizon at this point.",
"""Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries grew 0.2b.""ddw-Actually, TSLA received $789 million in payments from non controlling interests investing in subsidiaries. Selling interests in assets is the only thing keeping Tesla afloat. Look at the quarterly payments going out, which keep increasing (logically), since outside investors keep purchasing larger portions of Tesla's future cash flows.  This is the hand grenade that's going to blow Tesla up. The small net  $.2 billion increase is the result of cash coming in, payments going out, and an accounting loss for the VIE's.  Details are in the stockholders' reconciliation table for the year.",
"@Investor Gator,""Looking at obligations over the next twelve months, we can see over $6B in required payments, ""Wait, current maturities of long term debt are listed as $1.8 billion on the Balance Sheet. (Current portion of long term debt and capital leases and Current portion of solar bonds) That $1.8 billion represents what is required to be paid within the next 12 months on long term debt and capital leases. The chart you show on Contractual Obligations, page 58 of the 10-K, includes firm commitments based on purchase orders.  Some of that probably hasn't been recorded as transactions in the accounting system yet, but likely represents future transactions.  This is ""future stuff"" that hasn't transpired yet.   2018 Revenues and cash flow would come into play as to how much resources Tesla would have to meet the Contractual Obligations listed.  All of this is not ""firm"" as of yet or knowable, IMO.  So, the $1.8 billion is a more reliable number for payments that are due in the next 12 months on long term debt and capital leases, IMO. I used to prepare financial statements for a couple of public companies, as some background for why I am saying this.  The $2.506 billion you show for long term debt in 2018 from the contractual obligations chart is not reliable as far as what is required to be paid in the next 12 months.  Otherwise it would be listed as current maturities of long term debt on the balance sheet. That's the reason for that item on the balance sheet, to state and show what is due in the next 12 months. The ""Cash and cash equivalents"" you show of $3.3 billion, as well as the unused credit, represent amounts available as of January 1, 2018, but include no amounts for 2018 (revenues or cash flow) because that is in the future and not yet knowable. So, some of what you have presented are future transactions and events not yet knowable. You can't assume Tesla won't have the ability to meet these future obligations.  It just doesn't make sense. They will generate new revenue and new cash flow in 2018, some of which can be used to meet these future obligations listed in the Contractual Obligations.  And I am of the opinion that the accounting standard that you are citing about the going concern concept has more to do with a company that has decided to liquidate or go out of business or is required to liquidate or go out of business than it does about a company seeking to grow and stay in business. I think a little more objectivity is needed to properly assess accounting standards or the going concern concept, and I'm not trying to be hard or difficult.  I just think you've made some incorrect assumptions about the reason for the standard and about Tesla's ability to meet its obligations.  That's not to say that I don't share your concerns about Tesla being able to remain in business. They are completely dependent upon external funding to remain in business, I agree. But, thus far they have been able to obtain that funding without any trouble whatsoever, it would appear to me.  And the resources you show for meeting future obligations are not complete, but only show what was available at the beginning of the year.  That's like taking my bank balance and available credit at the start of the year and then looking at all my known obligations for the year and assuming I won't be able to meet those obligations.  But, what you have not counted are my wages for 2018 and other income  and credit resources that I will earn during the year that may be used to help meet those obligations.  (2018 cash flow, in other words, has largely been overlooked)",
There is no case law regarding this new regulation and that might be the planned defense should the SEC decide to take the auditors and/or TSLA on regarding any further debt or equity raise.  Any litigation would likely drag on for a long time allowing TSLA to continue as before for years. The next step by the SEC might only be a letter of enquiry.,
"""Tesla has been entirely dependent on outside capital to stay in business. ""The numbers don't back you up. Long term debt and capital leases (including related party debt) grew 3.2b in 2017. Paid in capital grew 1.4b. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries grew 0.2b. That's 4.8b of outside capital.But PP&E grew 4.0b, their car lease fleet 1.0b and solar lease assets 0.4b. That's 5.4b total. These numbers show a company that's dependent on outside capital to GROW their business, not to stay in business.You can do the same analysis for 2016, though it's messier due to the SCTY acquisition.If you look deeper, though, it gets a little trickier. Working capital is a source of cash for Tesla, but only BECAUSE they grow. If outside capital wasn't available to fuel Tesla's growth, their working capital benefit would disappear. At that point Tesla WOULD need outside capital just to stay in business. Unless they cut opex, of course, which bulls say would be easy in a non-growth scenario because a big chunk of opex is for growth.I don't have a strong opinion on that last point. First, because it's unknowable and second, because it's irrelevant. Tesla is a ""grow or die"" story. And since they still need outside capital to grow, by definition they need it to survive.",
Gator - any thoughts on a potential downgrade of debt in the near future? I was curious what kind of impact that might have on future borrowing and or equity raise. Would the credit rating companies now make a decision based on the recently issued 10k or is that really relevant to them?,
"Investor Gator,You talk about purchase obligations, but I don't see that as a huge issue; it's simply that they have contracts for purchases of inventory. It's good that they have committed supplies. This shouldn't affect cash needs if everything works as it's supposed to. (Although it appears that's not happening very well, a somewhat separate issue.)",
"Investor Gator - your link says: ""The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.""That means this rule was in effect starting with Tesla's 2016 10-K, right?",
I found the “risks to the business” that management listed as being so inclusive as to be worthless. Do other companies include that the earth may be hit by an asteroid? When so many risks are included you really minimize the real ones.,
"great note. simple and fact-based. in light of the new rule, tsla had three options: 1) admit they won't make it, 2) explain capital raising plans, or 3) (creatively) note that they can cut costs in order to get by. they chose option #3. this is troubling for a growth company. further, given the ""newness"" of the rule, it will be interesting to see if an unforecasted (but seemingly inevitable) capital raise will have an impact on investor sentiment. I suspect they will get a pass, as usual. but such a raise will only serve to exacerbate the company's worsening financial condition that was made clear in the 2017 10k.",
"Investor Gator,Your chart shows they have $2 bn. in uncommitted credit facilities. They actually only have  $800 million. The rest is ""financing funds.""  This is mostly the VIE's, which are sales of interests in assets to investors. Throwing assets overboard (selling them) is not really a good way to stay in business.  In any case, these funding sources all require unencumbered assets. I don't think they have a lot of unpledged assets lying around.  These sources basically help if they have new lease originations or new solar energy system leases they are putting in place. It's not money available to fund operating expenses etc.",

"It seems the company took the attitude that the additional disclosure is only applicable if they conclude they wouldn't be a going concern in a year.

As a former employee of UTX who has worked at all three divisions I wouldn't like to see a breakup. There is a lot of interaction between the divisions and engineers routinely shared ideas and resources to help solve problems (e.g. Otis expertise with motor controls helped the Aerospace division a few years back). Key players move back and forth (the current chief engineer of PW held the same job at Aerospace within the last decade).,
"Hi, thanks for the article, I appreciate the point of view.I am retired, and capital preservation and income are my primary investment objectives. I've been long UTX for 3+ years; very happy with the company's performance. I'm not so sure of your reverse SG&A point, but I agree completely re your organic growth point. UTX has been delivering good, predictable results for some time now. From what I understand of the Rockwell deal, this should bolster the company's aerospace business. Essentially, my take is that the company exchanged Sikorsky for Rockwell; on balance, a good move. I think management is very able. Michael, I think the main point you touch on above re 'does a spin off make sense' is questioning the value proposition. In UTX's case, I don't really see a red-haired step child of a business that would be better off on its own. Despite the Sikorsky/Rockwell deals (and other minor ones), I don't think of UTX as a wheeler-dealer type of conglomerate in the style of, say, GE (as a former investor in that name, thank God). Rather, I think of UTX as a conglomerate that has a plan, has stuck to it, and has delivered the goods. I am in UTX for the long term. Candidly, at the first whiff of any recessionary-type risks, I'll likely trim some of my UTX exposure. But I do plan to keep a core position, and then add over time on any significant dips. This is a good company that knows what it is doing. Keep doing it.Best of luck to all.",
Otis and Carrier are much less cyclical business than aerospace and defence. They give UTX  a measure of stability through business cycles. I am opposed to sacrificing stability in the hope of getting higher margins from all assets.,
"You make some good points.    A spinoff of Otis and CCS isn't a guaranteed winner.  However, I'm not sure how much weight I would put on the SG&A disynergies.  I know quite a bit about UTC and your $300-500M estimate seems way high to me.  Given UTC's holding company structure, there is no reason for Otis and CCS to incur incremental HQ expenses of more than $50M each, if that.  Each company already has a substantial divisional HQ staff of its own.  Incremental costs would come mostly from adding a few fees such as board of directors compensation, stock exchange listing expenses, ratings agency fees, and auditor fees.  Additional headcount would be minimal - only a few tax, treasury, and investor relations people.  One intangible that argues in favor of spinning the commercial units is that the new Otis and CCS shares would allow each company to tie management compensation more closely to performance.  This can be pretty powerful.One additional comment:  There is no reason I can see to keep Otis and CCS together.  Each is more than large and stable enough to operate on a stand alone basis. They are both building systems companies, but that's where the similarity ends.  They sell to different customers at different points in the building cycle.   Plus CCS has a large residential and refrigeration business that is unrelated to commercial construction and building management.",

"I do agree that the market for a standard iPhone is becoming somewhat saturated.  At least in the U.S.  Still plenty of growth opportunities in foreign markets.  Yes, people (in the U.S. at least) are holding on to their phones a bit longer.  I am an example of that. Have a 6 and just got the new battery last week.  I will probably hold on for at least another year. However, Apple is diversifying their rev streams.  The wearable business has had huge growth and that will only accelerate as connectivity improves with each iteration.  Services now has true momentum, the iMac is growing and even the iPad surprisingly had some growth.   The Phone is offered at multiple price points, all of which are profitable.   Obviously, this is critical for Apple but the Phone is entering in a cash cow phase of it's business cycle.  That is not a negative given Apple's continuing ability to diversify rev streams.  I hear nonsense about CAGR.  I laugh every time.  This is nothing more than simple math.  The bigger you are, the less CAGR you will have.  Growing from $48B to $50B in NI is only 4% while growing from $100m to $400m is 400%.  A $2B increase is still a $2B increase.  The big picture of Apple is solid.  If it were to double in price in the next 6 months, then I think the stock would be on shaky ground because I doubt earnings could rise that fast.

Since that time in 2015, we have added shares occasionally and now have a relatively small net amount of capital invested.With clinical phase biotechs trying to obtain initial commercialization approval(s), it can relatively suddenly become an all or nothing proposition. If ADXS ultimately succeeds in any of their lines of core focus, they could easily revisit their previous highs from 2015, or higher. For that reason, and because we have relatively little net capital invested, we won’t attempt any timing or stop loss activity. We’re in it to win it, but we’ll maintain from here no matter what.",

"Let's consider Ford's bankruptcy in under 10 years. While most automakers are busy cutting deals with lithium producers or buying them outright Ford has decided to take Blackberry's famous ""we'll wait and see"" approach. They have decided with misplaced pride that they will entering da EV market by dumping a bucket of water onto a forest fire. That is, they're allocating $10B to electrifying their fleet in the future...great. Let's do some simple math: Tesla's gigafactory costed $6B to build with absolutely monstrous tax incentives. When it's at full capacity it'll have 75% of the worlds current lithium EV production. They cannot even produce enough vehicles for the US market. So as Ford has kicked the can and lithium prices have tripled in the last 10 months alone Ford thinks they'll be globally competitive. No, they won't be. When they build out the EV infrastructure, spend money on ip, r&d, retraining and retooling and are ready to go they'll find no lithium available. Maybe they think they'll be buying it at market prices? At what, $75k or more a ton? The average EV vehicle has almost half a ton of lithium in the battery. They'll take a massive loss on every vehicle they sell. They're on the path to bankruptcy and to avoid it they would need to buy a mid-large lithium producer which would cost about $10B. They would need to repurpose facilities or build their own super gigafactory which would cost $7B and $10B respectively. They would need r&d, ip and retraining which would cost $3B-$5B. Don't believe those numbers dummies? No? Ok, let me be very concise by offering an example: Porsche, which set a record last year selling 260,000 vehicles globally is investing $7B(only in Porsche) in electrifying it's fleet and VW group doesn't think it's enough money. Ford sells 2,500,000 vehicles a year...They[Ford] need to spend every dollar they currently have but won't. They're busy buying trash like Chariot which has less utility than a public bus, is more costly and takes more time... They're busy spending billions on factories in Mexico to build more combustion engine vehicles which have no future.... This is Ford's path: they'll find no lithium, they'll look around and find vehicles driving themselves, they'll find Uber/Lyft fare prices dropping, automakers with free EV charging everywhere, they'll find dealer lots out of space because of new/used vehicles, they'll find a recession and then the UAW will drive the final nail. As they near bankruptcy they'll find no buyers because their combustion engine ip is useless, their r&d is outworn, their vehicle parts are all sourced from other companies domestic and abroad and their factories filled with the fat bodies of striking UAW workers.",
People keep forgetting Ford is really controlled by the Ford family via the Ford Foundation that owns 30 - 40% of the stock.

"Here are three reasons not to take a gamble on Ford: 1) losses in South America (ongoing and perhaps forever), Middle East, and break even in Europe, with no announced plans on how these problems will be fixed, 2) Ford has or is being kicked out of the passenger car market in the USA.  A new Focus is coming from China, but does anyone think it will take back market share from Corolla, Civic, and Cruze (which outsold Focus in 2017).  No final announced plan on Fusion.  Mustang is an exception, although it will not be long before the Asians will attack this niche.  The rest of the models (Flex, Taurus etc) are probably history, 3) No one on Wall Street, the employees, or the retirees have a clear vision of where the Company is going and how they are going to achieve their ""plan"" except for some very high level announcements,  It would be unwise to bet anything until Hackett describes in detail his corporate ""Fitness Program"".",

"Ratslayer, can you give it a rest on the UAW bashing? You never know,... you could be insulting some of your colleagues without even knowing it. Why would you assume that UAW workers have fat bodies?",
"I'm long F having purchased it very recently as a contrarian bet, that AV's are not going to take over the world (any time soon) and that Jim Hackett, the new CEO will be able to right size the company and get operating margins to their 8% goal. If I'm correct in my assumptions, then I believe the equity is undervalued at current prices.Having said that, this article is mistaken on a few of its financial terms, thus changing the financial ratios drastically (these really should be fixed by the author, since they are at the core of his premise about Ford):#1 FCF : You use of the term FCF in the article is not correct. FCF isn't even positive at F.  FCF is whats left over AFTER they pay out divvies and spend their cap ex.  What you are calling FCF is actually Operating Cash Flow (and very close to EBITDA), which is clearly different.  The term ""Free"" in this case means unencumbered or cash that is not already spoken for - its the cash thats left over that adds to the companies cash balance on the balance sheet.  Did you notice that cash on the balance sheet did NOT go up.  Although, you could make the case that acquisitions (which F has done quite a few) should not factor in to ""uses"" of cash, thus add back those amounts to FCF, but in F's case, those acquisition amounts usually are undisclosed.#2  Enterprise Value - Your use of the term EV is also incorrect.  EV is Market cap +debt - cash.  In Fords case, the EV appears higher than it actually is, because of Ford Credit.  You need to factor out Ford Credit and look at Fords automotive business as the Enterprise or your EV won't make sense.  Ford Credit is akin to a bank (banks EV are skewed as well and not a good measurement tool).  The loans FC makes to car buyers is classified as debt, thereby throwing off the EV calculation.  Additionally, those loans are offset by receivables, so it appears that they have a huge NET debt position, but in actuality, you must factor in the receivables (offsetting cash being received later).   Its better to look at F's Automotive cash balance, which is NET $11B ($26.5B of cash offset by $16B in automotive debt).  In this case, The true EV of F is the Market cap ~ $42B - net cash ($11B) or ~ $33B.If you think my analysis on the Financial ratios is incorrect, I'm happy to be proven wrong about how to calculate FCF or EV.Thanks!",
"The dividend looks good and the stock price is cheap.    If it continues this way, it'a a win win situation for Ford.",
"Yes, Ford stock price look attractive, but the one big hurdle I am looking at is how well will the new GM pickups do, and will they still sales from Ford. We all know new designs and hype win over new customers. If GM take some market share from Ford in pickups, this can hurt Ford.",
I also think you have to consider tax reform when lookijng at ford. They're a very profitable company and will benefit greatly from the reduced tax rates. This year they had some tax credits and paid a lower effective rate but their effective rate was over 30% in 2016 and would have been back up in that range in 2018 without tax reform. It will save ford hundreds of millions per year. In most cases with tax reform I feel like many companies were trading at stretched valuations and tax reform helped justify those valuations but didn't really warrant a bump. In the case of ford they were already very cheap and tax reform just made it that much cheaper. I don't think Wall Street has fully digested what this and how big this is especially for mature profitable companies like ford. It's. not easy for them to grow revenue or cut expense in a drastic manner but this a 14% reduction in their single largest expense. A game changer for sure.,

"I've been a Ford fan since the 1960s. I seriously doubt they can bring 16 full EVs to market in the 3.75 years remaining before 2022 models hit showroom floors in Fall 2021. I just don't think any auto maker can do it. I see daily articles on lithium mining, battery making, etc, and to me the auto makers are promising more than can be achieved. But I do  hope they get as close as they can and if they meet or surpass these goals I will be over the moon....in a red Tesla....",
"I repeatedly see articles saying that by 2030 the sales breakdown will be one third EV's, one third hybrids, and one third ICE. So Ford should be well positioned for 2/3 of the market. They have now made the investment for the other third. I'm curious what does it mean to be behind on electrification? Is GM producing its own batteries? How complex is an electric motor? They have been around longer then ICE.  The plant I work in has thousand of them, some bigger then jet turbines. Wouldn't Fords experience producing half a million hybrids give them some insight into electric motors? And if Tesla is so far ahead in thIs technology why didn't Ford take up Musks offer for Teslas technology and intellectual property free of charge? Ford has already slated a Mexican plant specifically for EV's so production shouldn't be an issue. When Ford states a long range, 300+ mile, affordable performance EV/SUV will be out by 2020 why are they percieved as behind or late? It sounds like they might be right on time.",

I think it's still too early to make this investment in electric - unless the battery technology  changes drastically to something other than lithium-ion.  There is just not enough lithium-ion resources to support this forecast of growth in electric cars.  I think the focus should still be on further improvements to ICE until that happens.,
"Another point: Ford is a global company. An American based company that provides global diversification.

No, it isn't but investing is gambling. Luck matters in both.A few comments say that there are better investments than Ford, but no mention of what those stocks are.

I think people need to start a #GetOutNow movement and have protest outside of RAD headQ and in front of SECWarning: if you need to have a bad day - please read year old proxy and you may vomit on CEO compensation game and how one gets to collect $40MM to drive straight into wall and groundhttp://bit.ly/2sNINBw,
"Investors should email, snail mail, and call the board of directors. Remember, that the BOD’s primary job is to ensure the prosperity of the company and its shareholders. By allowing this merger to go through, they are not fulfilling their responsibility. For more details on how to stop the merger see:http://bit.ly/2HARtPD",
"I read nothing in the earnings announcement that made me feel secure with what management intended to do with the money from the RAD to WBA store sales. Without a firm commitment from the BOD and CEO, to using the Walgreen's sale proceeds to pay down debt; the temptation for management to misuse, misallocate, pay themselves unwarranted bonuses, give themselves undeserving pay raises or to for ABS to bail themselves out, is too great and way too easily done. [It is similar to giving Trump a bag full of nickels and dropping him off outside of a nickel whore house while merely telling him not to go inside.] And once all the money is spent, RAD and ABS will have wasted the opportunity to right this teetering ship. Make no mistake about it, Stanley, RAD and those in charge at ABS are just as capable of stealing this opportunity from the RAD shareholders.  Anything short of paying off/down debt is literally stealing from the RAD shareholders. On a buyout or merger basis, the stock is worth at least twice the current price. ABS is not paying a premium, but getting RAD at a discount. All 10 of RAD's biggest shareholders should vote 'NO' and tell Stanley to take a hike. I hope management reads this. I hold 140,000 'No"" votes.",

I could be wrong but I thought they were over 5% for quite some time now, certainly before the deal was announced.  It does not dawn on you that many buyers were going in on RAD stock because it was too cheap assuming the pay down of debt. and maybe going it alone or a ""reasonable"" offer coming in during the year.  Albertsons is NOT such a deal.  Your assumption that the only reason they bought ""recently"" ,without providing the date, was that they were in cahoots to ""throw the vote"" to RAD is insulting to Vanguard, if not readers here.  Some institutions buy because it is a good investment in their view, nothing more.I am not in the mood to do the research for you, so why not start out by providing us the ""buy in"" date for this recent Vanguard purchase.

"http://bit.ly/2t6aCoR#So im my looking through the comments i see only a small few remarks with data on valuation with albertsons.  Im including this link that i just went through on the SEC site in the recent earnings filing by albertsons.  filing date jan 16 2018 its their 10Q.  you can click on the ""interactive data"" hot link button top left of the 10 q and it takes you to a drop down list...  most of you probably know of this already... so i used it to find their financial notes section specifically on the ""Fair Value Measurements"".  I provided the link above so you all may look at this as well. After looking and calculating all that ive seen so far from Albertsons?  I think its good they sold a lot of gasoline into an increasing labor pool trying to get to work because they are in a tough market and going backwards with the bulk of their other sales.  their fuel sales saved their balance sheets the way it looks to me.?  Anyone correct me if im mistaken...I would like to hear of rite aid offering Albertsons the opportunity to offer to their private equity investors the vote to dilute their share interest by 6 to 1 ( 5 for 1 ) and if the vote is declined we then renegotiate the current mess rite aid is in.  if the vote is accepted RAD should buy Albertsons out and eliminate the union contracts and renegotiate the whole mess into a profit center not soley reliant on smoke mirrors and gasoline sales.  I would have said beer sales also but it just so happens I shop at tom thumb and they price gauge on coors light and killians so I wont purchase from them.  I did not know albertsons owned them until i started sifting through the impact of this pending bad deal.  who knew small world.I think I would vote yes if rite aid were to reverse this deal and buy out Albertsons at a split as referenced above...I would like to hear from the commenters on the point of view shown on the link of what albertsons is reporting as their fair value measurements data provided.Its still a No vote with my shares for Rite Aid to be bought up by Albertsons,  and stock is drifting away from us it seems.",

It is distributed with Standley taking hit of 14M and Fidelity taking 80M hit for their silence.Most importantly Cerberus and other investors will take around 2.5B hit, even put their entire investment in red may be a 1B better than it would be.

Also, assuming the deal does not go through, the shares rose to $2.50 per share after earnings were reported.  Therefore, at least at one point, people thought the value of the stock was $2.50 per share as a standalone entity.  Now it is below $1.90 with no news at all?",
Standley has created perfect storm -- he holds 14MM shares- he gets cash $$ for becoming CEO of new co- he gets CEO salary after that along with new co shares (which we have no clue)- we have NO clue what Albert will be worth (but he got his cut already discussed)Standley has spent nothing out of pocket (even thought pockets are stuffed using RAD shares and comp) - to buy RAD.

It's still early guys.  There could be another offer on the table at any time.

Nonetheless, I still find it fascinating that the market has put RAD under $2. There is very little downside here and seems like a good opportunity at this point to jump in.

"Chris LauAmong the reasons that you are correct that the Albertsons merger should be rejected, not only by readers here, but of course by the institutional shareholders, is the sheer malfeasance over the years by the board of directors. Many here, who only starting following the stock since 2015 (and some of whom the SA mute button were invented for) make comments without the knowledge of what has ailed the company all these years-the board and its senior mgt.  This week I will begin contacting as many of the institutional holders as possible.  Readers here can begin to see what the problem has been all along with my decision to show you now one of many letters sent to the board over time.  Subsequent to sending this letter, the Coutu family sold their whole 30% position in the company.Mr. Francois J. Coutu                                                                                         June 27,2012Vice Chairman, President and CEOJean Coutu Group (PJC), Inc.530 Beriault St.Longuevil, Quebec J4G1S8, CanadaDear Mr. Coutu:As previously submitted to the Rite Aid board of directors on several occasions, the undersigned must hold the directors accountable for some of it's dubious decisions which clearly indicate that cronyism is alive and well in the Rite Aid boardroom, which is fully responsible for the poor financial condition that it's shareholders have been and will continue to be saddled with.As you must already know, Philip Satre, former lead board member, was the first to be singled out by this shareholder, and as a result he has not exactly had pleasant IGT (the slot machine co.) Annual Meetings during my attendance the last several years.  Even this shareholder could not imagine the ""jackpot"" of Rite Aid information that he offered at the conclusion of one of these meetings, which was quite a surprise given it's sensitive nature, and may explain his current absence now from the Rite Aid board.This shareholder has avoided causing any embarrassment to the Coutu family, based solely on the prior courtesies extended to me by Michel Coutu and a certain rapport that this shareholder believed he had with your brother.  However, my responsibilities to the charity I mentioned at the Annual Meeting, The Humane Society of Miami, must supersede all of this.The Rite Aid Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee continues to exercise intentional poor judgement on numerous past unethical events and more recent board nominations, which collectively cause Wall Street, the stock price movers, to look elsewhere in their stock investments.  You know this all too well, since in recently selling a significant percentage of your Rite Aid stock at $1.50, you do not believe you will see $2.50 anytime soon; not exactly a show of confidence in Mr. Standley.Additionally, the board press release on a Friday at 4PM at the start of a three day Memorial Day holiday, meant to bury the news of John Standley's promotion, does not exactly signal the full board's strong confidence in it's decision.  In any event, the stock price dropped on this news first thing when the market opened on Tuesday.  Instead of a corporate culture change, long overdue, we will simply have more of the same philosophy we have had for the last twelve years, since John Standley is part of the original culture  of Miller, Sammons and Standley in the year 2000, which continued the deterioration in customer service and brand name destruction.This shareholder has not been shy in warning against this anticipated decision.  Mr. Standley had this promotion ""in the bag"" by his ""boys/girls"" on the board from the very moment he returned to the company in 2008.  I have no doubt that if the board could promote Mr. Standley to the title of God they would, but that position is already permanently occupied.In attempting to protect my investment, regrettably I must put aside my respect for your brother and focus instead on your committee's complete disintegration in meeting it's fiduciary responsibilities not only to it's Rite Aid shareholders but as well to your Jean Coutu Group shareholders.  As you know, the prior write-down of your investment in Rite Aid to zero on your books has financially harmed your own shareholders.  It is long overdue for your shareholders to begin to understand why, in part, this has occurred and sadly some of the blame lies at your doorstep, as a member of the very troubled Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  The Chair of your committee, Mr. Anderson, will also now be spotlighted and he affords this writer a selection of Annual Meetings from which to attend.Some of the matters that your shareholders and the local/regional Canadian business media may be informed of include, but are not limited to:1. The shocking re-nominations to the Rite Aid board this year of Mary Sammons and Marcy Syms who have clearly and completely demonstrated incompetent or unethical business practices in clear violation of Rite Aid's own minimum nomination criteria.2. Allowed personal usage of corporate aircraft soon to approach $3 million, also known as ""legal theft of shareholder assets"" which, in Canada probably would result in arrests being made, and which behavior would never be tolerated in your own company.3. At a minimum, unethical insider trading by a former board member, allowed to remain on the board for a full year after board notification, rather than being immediately dismissed.  Shareholders and Wall Street are not interested in providing graceful exits for wrongdoers.4. A resignation of former board member Jonathan Sokaloff only after this shareholder notified the SEC and Rite Aid that the accumulation of over $9 million in ""consulting and other fees"" was unethical as an active board member, and thereafter after his resignation the proxy materials in 2010 indicate that the company had no plans to continue this practice.5. The extended third year payment of $500,00 to your brother had no proper business purpose other than to buy Ms. Sammons extra time to correct her malfeasance, which correction could never actually occur.  Rite Aid shareholders are not responsible for providing ""consolation prizes"" to any board member, in order for that board member and yourself to ""play ball"" with the remaining board members.6. The label of  Mr. David Jessick as an ""independent director"" tramples on the spirit of NYSE full independence rules, as this shareholder discussed at the Annual Meeting.7. Board fee increases in 2010 totaling nearly forty (40%) percent and a quadrupling in Rite Aid stock under cover of retaining two related consulting companies who had a huge unethical financial interest in giving the board the outcome they wanted, to unjustly improve the Board's personal wealth, while rejecting $1.6 million in invoiced recommendations pertaining to other company related matters. The statement in the 2010 proxy materials that the board will no longer engage these two companies together speaks poorly of the motivations of this board and the waste of shareholder assets solely for the directors personal gain, while they, and not the economy, have caused the financial suffering of it's shareholders.  The Compensation Committee, which your brother presides on,  bears the full responsibility for the way this was handled and it's outcome.8. Rather than breaking up the board, whose resumes in the vast majority clearly indicate either direct/indirect relationships with current/former senior executives/directors or who continue to do business indirectly with the company, the  board has not seen fit to nominate any truly independent board members without such ties in it's last twelve year history, other than those who have a contractual right to be a board member.Due to all of the above, this shareholder will take further actions as follows:1. Until specific changes are made which demonstrate to this shareholder that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee ""get it"" , as of 8/1/12 immediate contact will be made with your local/regional Canadian business media to discuss the decisions you made on the Rite Aid board which caused your Jean Coutu Group shareholders a significant drop in equity, and2. This shareholder will allow the expiration of one (1) year to review the needed changes on the board, the lack of which will ensure my attendance at the 2013 Jean Coutu Group Annual Meeting to divulge necessary information that your shareholders have a right to know.  None of it will speak well of your family's representation on the Rite Aid board which has already harmed your own company's shareholders. Certainly the damage caused by current Rite Aid board members in 2007, in making an ill-conceived purchase should have automatically triggered immediate resignations.The undersigned does not take these measures lightly, knowing that any goodwill between myself and your family members will obviously deteriorate.  However, my responsibilities to my charity and the many fine employees of Rite Aid must supersede the highly questionable performance and behavior of the board generally, and your committee in particular.I pray that the visit to your 2013 Jean Coutu Group Annual Meeting will not be necessary, however, I fully expect based on past events that my passport will have to be dusted off.Sincerely,Steven KrolRite Aid Shareholder",
"Seriously, why couldn't WBA meet with FTC, find out how many stores they'd have to divest and make a $3 cash offer for RAD.    What would Albertson's say?  Hell, they can't even prove they could pay $2.50 a share.  I think someone else will make a hostile play for this and it will go to a vote.   The shareholders will take the cash or the stock that is trading with an ascertainable value.  It's still early in the game.   They aren't fully divested of WBA and no one else has even had an opportunity to bid.",

"That's a serious question above that no one is considering yet.  Wouldn't institutions be forced to buy this new company, due to it's size, for all kinds of index funds?  How does this type of buying take place with a new stock that will magically start trading one day, with no IPO price?  They probably can wait a while to buy I'm assuming, but I wonder how long and how it will affect the price of these new shares.  I just want to know what the hell we are getting for 1 share of RAD.  No one even knows and Standley has sold the company without knowing!  Is this the OTC markets, how can this even be legal on the NYSE exchange?",

"If I wanted the share price to increase,  even for a short while,  I think I would have announced the debt payoff prior to announcing a horrible merger.",
What could be the short buy upswing potential if RAD stay wholly undivided or merged? Say to buy at current $2ish.,
"I'm also unsure if when RAD shares convert to the new stock, are we then considered ABS holders in a lock out period?   I'm not sure where to find this information at, as everyone seems to have their own opinion or legal interpretation some saying yes, and some no, it appears no one even knows for sure if we will be able to sell the new stock on the day it opens or not?",
"One question I'm wandering about, that I haven't seen discussed here, is if this new company is so large based on revenue.  Does that mean index funds will be forced to purchase it?  If so, how does that work or when would they buy it?  The first day it opens, or at a later date?  How might this forced institutional buying affect the new stock's price and when?",

"If you were one of the real estate folks who invested alongside of Cererbus and saw an opportunity to buy up RAD on the chearp by cutting a deal with Standley, you would probably beleive today that having patience with letting the WBA divestiture play out and they sneaking in with a low ball offer was great execution.You can blast Cererbus and Albertsons all you want and claim they are just greedy bastards too  But they watched RAD and did homework on the firms value and saw a bargain opportunity.  The only way this gets de-railed now is with a higher bid from a yet unknown potential buyer.   And if there is another potential buyer, they might not want to get into a bidding war and will back away.Cererbus and Albertsons might not have run a great grocery operaion, and they may not see synergies that are promised with RAD, but as capitalists they seem to have jumped on a opportunity at what appears to be on the back of unfortunate RAD shareholders who are not served well by the RAD board.This is capitalism.   I don't like being a RAD investor here, but this is the way the system usually works.  Real estate investors, such as those involved in Albertsons, buy stuff at low prices.  This is what they do is should  be expected.  And Standley had no issues  with being a willing party since he will now be the CEO of the merged company.The logic all makes a lot of sense from Albertsons point of view.",

What idiot could have negotiated this?Let's see. I'll steal 40% of your value, or you owe me 64 million! Both the CEO and lapdogs on the BOD need to be fired immediately and without severance.  64 million for Standley's sheer buffoonery is small when you consider the other blunders he's made, but hopefully it's the last 64 million this idiot can blow.",

About the only thing that could change is IF some activist buyer offers to pay more for RAD.  If that happens the RAD board would have to listen, I guess, but it seems to me that Standley has a big incentive to make Albertsons merge because he is heavily conflicted with a lucrative job of CEO of the merged company.   As we all have learned the hard way with investing in RAD.   Nothing about RAD is normal or typical.  I would expect some class action suits to be filed just because some lawfirms know they can get paid off with a settlement early so there is no obstruction to the merger.   Plenty of accident chasers that do this anytime there is a complex transaction dependent on promises  and they make a good living bringing suits and shareholders only get pennies, if that.  These firms are experts in finding defects in merger agreements and take it to court.",
"It has to be slowly sinking in the psyche of the market, what utter sleaziness surrounds this deal.  More fireworks to come, for sure!",
It is impossible for Elliott or any other activist investor to gain more than 5% of the outstanding shares. Management and BoD of Rite Aid implemented a 'poison pill' for the entire 2018 year. They did this in the first week of January while in full knowledge that they were working out a merger deal with Cerberus.  Illegal ? on't know but hard to believe they were not intent on protecting this deal when creating that wall.,
Why did Vanguard and other Large Institutions buy more shares of Rite Aide while the stock was dropping in valule as WBA money was pouring into Standley and BOD. Is there a Quid Pro Quo going on for votes on the merger. Please check out SEC & FTC ?,
"MWD thank you for the 150 page reading assignment ;-).  I know what I am doing tonight after work.  Out of the gate, yes heavy debt and interest obligations eat up all profits.  Breakeven business, FCF floats the operation.  They have $3B of ALB borrowing available - gee I know more debt.Back of the envelope: $3,300M EBITDA (from slide show) x 3.0 (dog multiplier) / $393M shares (from slide show) = $25.19.  So $2.52 is not unheard of.  That also matches what others have calculated based on the option #1 & #2 buyout scenario.At negative net margin, we can't scale off of the $83B Revenue for a figure. But we can use Enterprise Value.  The multiple on EV will be 1/2 the going rate for this mess plus positioned in a market segment which typically carries low valuations.  I'll look at that tonight.Either way, RAD is worth more than $2.09, we should be trading up at $2.35+ at this point.  I can see a 5% discount for the unknown merger effect (and management characteristics).  This is partially a PR issue.  Unlike a traditional IPO, no one is hyping the deal.  Why should they.  The advantage of the backdoor, Reverse IPO, already have a float and market makers.Watch Dropbox.  IPO with PR and everyone is interested to buy a piece of the cloud.

"papaExcellent post above.  I think you nailed it by coining the term ""Standley discount"".For once you have given RAD shareholders the power to succinctly describe pricing of this stock.The problem is that Albertsons private shareholders are taking advantage of the Standley discount in the ratio of shares that will be given to RAD holders.   And as long as Standley is in charge, the discount seems to be embedded in the current $2.10 share price.In effect this about like SA reader ""dumbfarmer"" agreeing to buy a piece of land from his neighbor for a very low price and then dumping loads of manure on the property line so that no other buyer will emerge.   Standley and his board have ""stunk up"" RAD so they can give it away to Albertsons and  even continue with an afterlife in employment contracts  out of the merged company.    The ""Standley discount"".  Very appropriate term.",
"The only good news I can find is that someone thinks there is upside to RAD.Jan 2019 $3 calls are fetching about 15 cents, and Jan 2020 $3 calls are bid/ask $0.25 / $0.33 with a decent open interest.  The $1.50 puts to the same expirations are only getting about a dime and 20 cents respectively.I sold $4 Jan 2020 calls and I'm trying to buy them back for a few pennies on the $ and the market wants way more.  I have all the time in the world, because if those don't expire worthless I'll be as happy as can be.",

"Based on my rough math, Cerberus ""put together"" Albertsons with 2 acquisitions for around $ 12B within the last 3 years.   The investment is a dud because of new competitions and price war.  Yet, Cerberus make a deal with RAD with a valuation of Albertsons of $24B.    Sure, Cerberus will not get $24B because the new company stock will tank once the deal is finalized.

"Chris - Do you and others think - cutting a deal between Albertsons & RAD between ""friends"" is considered INSIDER TRADING? Clearly, knowing what we know of WMT, KR, TGT and others fate - Albertsons is lower end of low. Thus, RAD prospects are worst off than standing alone. Why would CEO/BOD - agree to such a deal? Because it makes financial sense for themselves - not for majority of share holders. Standley has 14M shares. If he accepts cash - its $28M in pocket. Plus sign on cash and CEO position. Its going well for him. He would NOT care for harm he is causing. All this because he is greedy and friends with another greeedy from Albertsons. Let's play this another way - if he is not able to cash out his shares and he is not getting any position with Albertsons - would he sign for such a deal? No of course not. He is greedy but not stupid (i hope). IMO - this is a classic case of twisting fiduciary duty role. The CEO has shown his loyalty and this is a Trojan horse. This is insider trading - a lawsuite is in order and CEO and other exec and BOD should see jail time. Clearly Standley has not paid any price - botched original merge with WBA, botched second merger with WBA and not abortion of the their merger in progress and having affair with old friend - Where does he think his loyalty is?

"I was in and out or RAD years ago. Still followed, but never tempted to get back in. This deal does look like robbery. The only thing that matters is how the big holders think. In this case I wonder if they even care.

So I made money recently on NXPI because Elliott had an interest, not in me but in making money on NXPI.

If not, it isn't my money, so it is easy for me to say that I would take the Albertson's stock deal, if only because I would then be on the side of the buyer who is taking advantage of RAD. It also opens up the possibility that activists could move in on that new company...remote possibility, but it would explain why the big money interests are not objecting to the deal, and possible activists are biding their time.In any event, I wish you all the best. But just be realistic about your situation, including whether your no votes will matter, and if not, what your best course of action should be.",
Another question if someone initiated more than 5% and poison pill is triggered what happens to ABS deal. Do they need to pay two shares for every 10 shares.,
By the way when is the vote. Mine is no. If that has an impact then good else it doesn't matter anyway. Like someone pointed out there was no vote when price changed from $9 to $6.5 and then sold 40% of shares.,
"I'm gonna vote no, but why is the stock not trading at $2.50, if the offer is so low, other company will come around to outbid, at least the stock should trade on the price of the low ball Albertson pathetic first bid",
"I agree with ""its playtime""....who the hell out there is going to give rad a second look...nobody!!!!! and if a class action lawsuit follows,the shareholders get buried even more..the only one to make out on lawsuits is the lawyers......but at least then then rad managment gets kicked in the butt...maybe............i will probably sell and take the loss and chalk it up to greed!!",
"The decision here is easy.  VOTE NO, NO, NO!   DON'T LET THEM BELIEVE WE ARE OUT OF THE GAME!   I WILL EAT MY SHARES BEFORE I SELL OUT,  JUST ON THE PRINCIPAL THAT HIGHWAY ROBBERY IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY. This will end up in a lawsuit.",
"Let's not forget that no shareholder ever received the opportunity to vote for the first amended buy out with WBA that reduced the price to $6.50 to $7.  Like that deal, no one really knows what the price will be as no one can say what the market price of one Albertson's share will be.  I recall though that the sentiment back then was still overall in favor of taking $6.50 per share.  Sentiment now is much more negative",
What will happen to the RAD bonds ?,
"Look at the stocks of WBA and CVS.  They are strong (unlike RAD, which has been pillaged of its good assets), but future valuations are being discounted because they're under assault from all sides. There is no higher offer coming for RAD, which is fairly valued.  Turn down Albertson's, and all that follows is darkness.",
I'm voting no.. The majority stakeholders have the final say.. It doesn't help if they're passive.. I don't want to be around when they finally do the back door IPO..,
"This author should have mentioned the value of the PBM in the article as well.  That makes the deal even wose.  I guess along with the lowball offer on stores, we are just giving the PBM away for free along with it?  How can this be legal, we are about to be stolen from if no one steps in here.  How can this be acceptable to large holders like Vanguard and Oppenheimer?  Im concerned Cerberous is buying as many shares as possible this week for a cheap $2 yes vote.",
"As a shareholder, I agree with a no vote.My question is....what happens to the stock as long as Stanley is at the helm?With a no vote victory...the stock price will continue to drop until management gets forced out.Not sure what’s better: $2.50 within 6 months or seeing lows of $1.30’s with Stanley in charge without the deal. Because of this the large funds will vote yes just to get out of this mess.This vote should be for the removal of management and BOD.Frustrated!",
realistically i don't have enough shares to really hold long.   i will be selling out at a small loss and buying some DIA calls to recoup losses.    RAD will continue to be an excellent short all year,
"Even if albertson offers a better deal, it won't work if based on Albertson stock. The stock will immedeately tanks after it's issued, and the final result will be same. Only if a stronger company is involved or more cash is offered by Albertson, the deal will make sense!",
"Are you joking... I am waiting for management to come back to me and tell me what they think the earnings will be for RITE AID Alone.....  Even if it is 50 cents a share for the year do the math... That's a 7.50 stock at 15 times earnings... Mind you... Rad has already sais that there is 300 million savings in interest expense and 200 million in cap ex savings... With 1 billion shares that 50 cents right there... Also, mind you, Rad was break even or making a small profit with the old footprint... Now, let's add the better stores remaining, the better COGS with WBAD deal for 10 years...  So, at 7.50 Albert would have to reach 75 bucks to be even.. With Kroger at 25 who makes 2 billion profit WITH paying a dividend.. Do you think Albert will trade at 75.... I will be in the ground for decades before that happens.",
i guess it is almost time to start selling calls at $2.5 again,
"I am holder of near 50k shares , voting NO.No imagination here. real estate can be spun off, and the company can be releveraged after using the WBA money to pay down their debt. Cerberus at 70+ % will be the beneficiary of all that cash going out the door. PE guys are notorious for getting their investmentout via fees, recaps and special dividends to themselves. RAD s/h will get pennies and management will retire rich on our backs. Eff em.",
"WOW, so many complainers now.  How unfair this deal is right?  How badly the company is managed.  How Standley and the board are crooks, etc, etc.Where were some of you complainers, especially the long-term holders, even last year, forgetting for the moment years before!  Oh, that's right, going to Annual Meetings are a waste of time to give yourselves an excuse for the reason you never show up!Looking just at last year's Meeting:,1. the stock had already tanked badly, 2. the chronology of events were clear that Standley was already throwing his shareholders ""under the bus""; to do anything to get those ""accelerated stock options"" which shareholders had voted to stop 6/15 and the board ignored the voice of their shareholders.3.  you had a right to demand Standley's immediate resignation, just like Staples got it from their CEO, a mere 3 weeks after their failed acquisition of Office Depot4. there were already ethics issues on at least 3 current directors, 2 of which approved the Eckerd acquisition, which is responsible for the mess Rite Aid got itself into, and one of  those directors who did not even bother showing up for the Annual Meeting, without excuse.WHERE WERE SOME OF YOU??  If a mistake is made at the cash register where you shop and you are owed back .50 cents you will complain, but not your large stock investments.  Let someone else do that, I can't be bothered to go to an Annual Meeting, you make an excuse to yourself for.  Last years Annual Meeting in Harrisburg, had the usual shareholders, the many elderly shareholders coming for the coffee and donuts, poorly attended.  Imagine that, Standley just erased a majority of your equity by picking the wrong dance partner in Walgreens, not minding the store, who is on numerous outside boards, allowing at least 3 directors (more if you include the Nominating Committee) to be re-nominated despite their conflict of interests, misrepresentation of their qualifications and and in one case, Marcy Syms, who at her own company, Syms Corporation, unilaterally delisted her stock off the NY stock exchange and place them on the pink sheets, in what court documents suggested was  a scheme to IMMEDIATELY devalue the stock; devalue it did with bankruptcy not far behind.Indeed, when I raised these issues once again last year, several other purported shareholders (perhaps plants in the audience to defend management's $2 stock) called me ""snarky"".  I could have used more ""snarky"" shareholders in the audience.  Unfortunately, nothing but crickets, and you allowed Mr. Standley's wish-to get out of the room at fast as possible.  Funny thing is the hotel advised me we had paid for the meeting room for 4 hours; the meeting hardly lasted 1 hour; Mr. Standley kept repeating he had ""time constraints"" which is why he attempted to continually interrupt my comments that ran past his 2 minute arbitrary time limit to speak.So, some of you should be looking inward and ask yourself what is your responsibility to defend your investment instead of just leaving it up to others.  The Parkland, Fl. students have proved one thing, there is strength in numbers; we could have used more strength at last years Annual Meeting.Lastly, lest you forget because Mr. Miller has been allowed to skate away mostly ""scot free"" because human beings have a short attention span.  Mr. Miller ran Rite Aid into the ground from 2000-2007 as Chairma/CEO, when he received nearly 1/2 million in bonuses to simply close the Eckerd deal and then left the mess up to Mary Sammons, when he resigned from that position and remained on the board for several years more.  So, if this Albertsons deal closes, the 2 out of 3 worst executives/directors that Rite Aid had for a dozen years will run the newly joined Albertsons/Rite Aid.  Can it get much worse than that?",
"All I could say is wow. Walgreens must be pissed as hell. The FTC has blocked them from fully taking over RAD and Albertsons gets a freaking discount deal, plus Amazon has started to come into the market. To boot, Walmart, Costco are also growing in the pharmacy business. As a Canadian, I can't believe the bullshit you retail investors have to put up with! I hope we have enough power to change this.",
There is no question about it.  RAD CEO and BOD are the enemies of people who have invested their hard earned money in RAD.   We must bring this entire thing to daylight.,
Sorry.  Nothing holders can do with the poison pill.  All you can hope for is deal collapses,
"Forty years ago I owned a large piece of a marginal unionized trucking company. Thought I had its liquidation value all scoped out in the event of a recession. Well, I was wiped out by the company’s share of the multi- employer pension deficit which became due upon the company’s closure and withdrawal from the plan. Albertson’s share of their multi- employer pension plan deficit is $3.5 BILLION. This greatly limits managements ability to make significant changes without paying to leave the plan. This is a stranglehold on a declining business and  I would like the RAD shareholder to be aware of this. Sold my RAD the instant I looked at the Albertson balance sheet. In a period of rising interest rates companies like Albertsons will get crushed.",
"The IPO seems like a very grim prospect. Only the greed mongers at the top win in this deal. I shall leave it in my IRA to fester for decades, with very long dated puts once they become available.",
21665 shares voting Hell No!,
"I have no problem holding RAD stock.  But to turn it into a badly run version of Kroger is unfair.  If I wanted to invest in groceries, I'd have put my money elsewhere.  I hope to get back to my buy-in, which is pretty close to current, but just far enough that I'm not optimistic.  I'd have rather put the money into a sinkhole, knowing now that it's being given to Cerberus so that they can exit their horrible investment in Albertsons.",
Standley should be elected Chairman of the Board of the CEO Hall of Shame.  How someone can have absolutely no conscience is stunning.,
Voting NO,
"What this deal does is cast a pall over the new stock of the combined company.  After seeing what Standley did to RAD stockholders, how much confidence will their be in a debt laden ship loaded with the same pirates who just destroyed so much investor capital?The answer is very little.  This will be hugely discounted for lack of trust in management.  How many people do you know who are clamoring to buy the stock from the new company?  Can you count them on one hand?  Or do you even need one finger?Steal a loaf of bread and you go to jail.  Steal a billion dollars, and you live in a gated community.",
Premarket sentiment was good when the NEWS of this deal came out (+30%) and the market responded once the DETAILS were released. Shame on Cerberus and Standley for having no shame.,
"Long RAD, no good reason to get <$4/share - this is highway robbery at its best. WBA may not have had the right number but Albertsons definitely has a wrong one.",
"All I can say is if it someone makes a better offer on RAD and buys it, I am available to personally fly to RAD headquarters to escort John Standley out of the building.  I'll bring a garbage bag with me and will help to empty his office.",
"Be as much of an activist as you can here.  Whining on SA doesn't help.If you are a Vanguard customer, write them a letter.  RAD is a small cap, so it is in their small cap index funds and ETFs.  VSIAX has 16million shares, VSMAX has 25million shares.  These are tiny holdings in big small-cap index funds;  they won't care unless you make them care.One letter or e-mail won't matter.  Maybe a bunch won't matter either, but maybe they will.  And just a suggestion -- don't ""scream"" and complain and make outlandish claims;  just tell them that at an implied $2.50 but with all the risks associated with Albertsons, this offer could easily be worth less than the pre-offer market price of RAD, and that they need to investigate it for themselves to protect their fundholders.  You can even throw in a compliment and tell them you invest in Vanguard Funds because they shield / protect the small investor from the ""jungle"", and that while RAD is just a tiny part of the portfolios of these funds they have an opportunity to send a very loud message that they stand by the retail investor.Change the names on your letter and send it to Blackrock, Oppenheimer, Fidelity, and the rest.History says it may very well accomplish nothing, but for 5 minutes of your time it is worth a shot.  Rite Aid investing has certainly been the home of quite a few firsts and surprises the last few years, maybe one of those will land on the investors' side...",
"Unfortunately, white knights have better opportunities. The acquisition of RAD poses a significant challenge. Keep praying, a miracle may happen.",
Thank you Chris for having enough sense to see what a terrible deal this is and having the guts to say so.,
Unless an activist shareholder shows up this deal will go through. It’s a bad deal for anybody holding shares.,
I agree with you also.I am also voting no.I think 2.50 is not enough especially since it is stock and 18 cents.It traded at 2.50 just a few weeks earlier.It either needs to be more stock or all cash deal.The problem with stock is no one really knows what Albertsons is worth.,
"From a real estate prospective the cost to replace a Rite Aide store is well in excess of $970K, and that is just the bricks and mortar and not taking into consideration if the ground is owned or leased. I am voting NO.",
Standly and RAD is a complete farce and Albertson's is hardly a picture of financial health. Two lousy operators getting together just creates a bigger mess.,

"Albertson's is a discarded carcass that has the same future that wagon wheel makers had when autos came out.  They've been bled dry of all their value by Cerberus.  While the proposed price is terrible, the fact that they expect us to take it in preposterously overvalued Albertson's stock is the real kicker.The new order of supermarkets is Aldi.  This is what's coming.  Albertson's cannot compete here and it will be a matter of a few years before it goes the way of Sears.  In fact, this couldn't be more outrageous if we combined with KMart and took Sears stock as payment.  That's just how bad this deal is.WE MUST FIRE JOHN STANDLEY.",
"Don't the funds have some sort of fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders, especially when a deal is so ridiculous?  Standley is a poster child for corporate executive greed.   When you're going to steal like this from your shareholders, the more who realize what's going on, the better.  People have worked hard for their investment money.  To have private equity come in and steal it through this convoluted deal is simply beyond outrageous.  That the BOD and CEO are cooperating with this for personal enrichment is just unacceptable.  The public should be angry.Not only do we need to vote the deal down, we need to fire John Standley as soon as possible.",
"unfortunately(and i am a large RAD shareholder),RAD is only worth what the market will PAY!!! if there is to be any takeover(merger)with Albertsons that involves the SAME MORONS running the combined entity,AND the value of RAD is based on getting a % of that entity, then even today'sprice may be too high!!! the best a shareholder can do now is to wait for a rallyin RAD(if it happens) and then sell $2.50 calls to collect premium.""stupid is as stupid does"" applies her to RAD as it ALWAYS HAS(unfortunately).",
"if shareholders would get 3 bucks, it would still put the discount to weighted value roughly at 30%.  2.50  simply unacceptable.",
"I totally agree CEO and BOD did not even consider shareholders. All they care about is their position or their benefits. I will vote no for the merger, however, we need big shareholders like vanguard to threaten before going to Vote. Voting no may not end up good. CEO might be in his backyard counting chicken before they hatch and totally ignore current stores (like he did before). If vote is no he will come to conference call with negative same-store sales and mumble something which kill the price. Best course of action for shareholders is to get better deal and move on. Unless someone steps in with a  better offer, unfortunately, that is the reality for now. $3 is the best case scenario for now even if there is another offer on the table, there is no reson for anyone to say no for $3 cash offer. $2.5 with ABS is what I am hoping right now which is close reality. Amazon offering some thing may not happen. At least if price reflects $2.5 most of retail shareholders like me will be out. ""The approximately $2.50 per RAD stock values the buyout at $2.6 billion, or just $970,000 for each store"" - What is the basis for this. Are you considering envision as $2B or $3B?  We have debt of 2.9B so looks like you are putting $3 for envision. If we bring envision value to 1.5B then each store is valued around 1.5M. I really don't know if PBM is worth 1.5B or 3B. With changed landscape may be it is 1.5B. How ever market thinks with current deal RAD is worth close to $2 that puts per store at 1.3M.We can use any number but store price is not even close to 2.2M WBA offered and these are supposed to better stores than what they sold. In theory they should be around 2.5M which should fetch around $4.8/share (if some one want to buy those stores).",
Agree: Vote 'No'.,
"The fact that RAD share was traded shortly almost a buck (30%) higher before the merger news announcement tells it all how bad the deal is.  The only parties benefited, if the deal concludes as stated,  are the current management, particularly the CEO with a new job, and Albertsons which uses this scheme to backdoor an IPO.  Definitely RAD shareholders should oppose this deal using all the legal means including class action suits in addition to voting NO.",

"I don't see how this article is an ""elucidation"" of commercial partnership.  There is nothing new here at all.  CEO Carlo came out last Friday with a vague update indicating there is an ongoing discussion with two potential partners, but offers no specifics that should increase investor's estimate  that the chances of a deal are any better or worse than they were 3 months ago.Carlo said in his PR that the process is still ongoing and they are in discussions with two groups, and ""Each group is engaged in what we believe are later stages of diligence, which may include discussions with potential drug buyers, wholesalers and distributors,""This statement gave me the impression that the CEO really doesn't know (with any clarity) what in fact the two groups are doing. If they had actually told him they were in ""end-stage due diligence"" why not just say so? My interpretation of his entire update is that he has no concrete evidence of what stage of DD the two interested parties are in, nor does he have clarity on how serious these parties are about being ADMP partners.  Consider that even assuming these potential partners are nearing the end of their research about the prospects for a deal, their conclusions might be  bad for ADMP. That is, no information presented by management gives us a clue regarding the disposition of the so called due diligence on the part of the interested parties.  Keep in mind that TEVA's generic epinephrine pen could potentially be marketed before ADMP's pen, which can not be considered anything other than a handicap for ADMP in discussion with any potential partner.",

It has traded 40% of an average days volume already.  Seems a little heavy to me.,

"LVS should purchase Wynn, and no different than Weinstein company, lower the offer price to include a fund of $100 MM to handle the class action suit that ""may"" arise against the board of directors and Wynn.Than by purchasing the family Wynn shares, which apparently cannot be presently severed. LVS has a leg up on all the competitors than with ownership of 21.4% of Wynn. Wynn family agrees to sell their shares before they are force to reduce the ownership for market price + 10% which is set aside to cover litigation since Steve caused the action. The 10% withheld for litigation should placate the Board of Directors. Elaine and Steve receive $3.9 Bn. paid in three payments during the calendar year. LVS initiates an offer for 29% more of the company at $195 per share for 29 MM shares. An expenditure of $5.65 Bn, thus giving LVS effective control of the company.The sale of Macau Taipa Wynn and Encore Resorts raises $ 12. Bn +50% of total debt of Wynn Resort, plus an additional $2 Bn for Sands Macau. This sale should placate Chinese/Macau governments. With that sales to new Chinese ownership also provides the casino operator license. That is why the cost is $12 Bn for the two entities with the Taipa Wynn and Encore Resort name is removed upon closing of all aspects of business.Wynn Palace is transferred to the LVS/ Sands Macau license.That monies received from the sale of Taipa resorts, eliminates the debt of the remaining $5 Bn of Long Term Debt, leaving $7 Billion to pay the remaining construction debt of Encore Boston  Harbor of $1.2 Bn. Additionally, $2 Billion will be set aside to pay for Wynn West in North Las Vegas, mini convention center.  Thus leaving $5 Billion dollars + cash float which will be used to bid in JAPAN.",

When I go there for dinner, to gamble, or for a show, I am always treated with the utmost respect.  The restaurants pale to none in Vegas, the grounds are clean and well-maintained, and except for Elvis Costello getting cancelled the shows are awesome.

"Howard, I agree with all your comments to Lydie.  Please continue to invest in projects that will provide ever increasing EBITDA in the future.  Past investments (i.e. Palace) are starting to reap huge rewards.  I can't wait to see Boston finished and up and running.  I really wish WYNN can/will stay independent.  I like focusing on the high-end consumer and wouldn't relish having these awesome properties diluted.  However, if Steve has to sell all his shares it will probably go to a single buyer (could the company buy them back?).  Long run the value of these properties is why the shares haven't fallen below $160 and I doubt they ever will without a serious buyer coming in.",
Howard:  What is your response to he question of which would be a better buy at this point:  LVS or WYNN?  I own some LVS and have patiently waited until I am finally in the black.  Do I buy more or diversify to WYNN?  Is there too much turmoil and uncertainty right now in WYNN and better to wait until dust settles a bit?,

"Howard, I own a fairly decent position in both lvs & wynn with both recently getting back into black numbers (bought about 3-4 years ago).  My thoughts a month ago were that wynn would be the better investment but with these latest developments think that lvs might give a much better opportunity for their regular ops and potential to take on the wynn operations too.  Between the two today would you agree lvs is the superior growth and income play?As always, thanks for sharing your considerable knowlege.",
"Mr. Klein, any potential buyer would have to be able to place a value on Wynn's Macau operations for which a looming uncertainty exists--license expiration. Without knowing the details of what comes after the expiration, how could any potential buyer put forth a bid, no less for a premium as you speculate? Nobody now knows with any certainty what Wynn's Macau operations cash flows will be post-expiration because the Chinese government hasn't yet disclosed what it will expect of these companies assuming a new license bidding process ensues. I think any potential bidder would have to be pretty confident that the future after license expiration will be similar to the past in order to come up with financing and be willing to risk the amount of money that such a deal implies.",

"I accumulated long ago when Steve Wynn was buying low 50s. I also accumulated more than a double down when the price tanked. I have followed Howard all the way through  and find his articles so insightful I feel that it is close to border between legalized and illegal insider trading information...lol Of course he has no insider knowledge that I am aware of but he does have a knowledge and grasp of the casino industry better than anyone that publicly produces articles such as his. No one on Seeking Alpha or any other website that I'm aware of provides anything close to the insightful knowledge of a sector of any of my other stock sectors that I own. The only thing that trumps Howard is when Steve Wynn prevents during the WYNN earnings release conference calls. I, for one, will truly miss Steve Wynn and his leadership in running the company and his openness in sharing his vision. I truly am lacking and knowledge of Maddox and really who he is...I don't no because Steve when did not build him up with a history of what he has accomplished. I do like the prospect of LVS and Adelson accumulating shares slowly or buying out WYNN directly. I also like the fact that Adelson could allow Maddox to run the WYNN with his oversight. I am fine with that as long as he does not ""cheapen"" the Wynn experience. I am also an adamant supporter to keep the current Wynn branding...solid brand. Heck, when the colonel went away Kentucky Fried Chicken was still fine....right? lol Same thing could be said of Walt Disney who had his own vices as some of us are aware of as exposed in the book ""Dark Prince of Bel-Air"". The Wynn brand is so deeply entrenched into his entity that his happy confident voice is heard seemingly everywhere while visiting and while making phone reservations. Howard most certainly provides a three-course meal, food for thought, in continuing to invest and WYNN. I am thankful to Howard that he wrote this on a weekend so I have time to sleep on it one more night before the Market opens tomorrow. Currently I have no plans of selling or buying additional HK: 1128 or WYNN shares until I let my subconscious grapple with this new information and wisdom from the King of Casinos Stocks Howard Jay Klein.",
"Howard, excellent discussion, as usual.  Sold my WYNN at 200.50, before the revelation of the presidential proclivities, which we all have known about for awhile.  We never had such dastardly stuff going on at Caesars in the day!  Sheldon seems more attuned to Israel these days, and is really getting on in age.  A deal like this doesn't sound like something Rob would do (Bill might have).  It would be a big deal to swallow, regulatorily and price-wise, given WYNN's expansive PE;  and especially with LVS so hugely into the mass market, rather than the WYNN market.  I suppose the deal would be a positive for Japanese gaming, if and when that happens, since it would combine LVS's Singapore experience with WYNN flair, presuming that the flair remains by Wynn coming aboard as a non-executive consultant on thought and design.  Best regards,  Bob Reilert",

Thanks Howard,
"Nice analysis.  On another topic, is the visa price increase a big issue?  Is this a sign of more meddling and intervention which will set Macau back or should we just take this at face value?

"if they approve Amazon purchasing Whole Foods, why would they approve 7 casinos in the USA WHEN there are 10,000 of various size.  Additionally, how many casinos does CZR have and they purchased a casino group out of Indiana. As well in this scenario, the Wynn Macau group of casinos are being sold off. As well we know that China prefers to have for each license a different casino operator.This purchase of $20 Bn is a great deal cheaper than SA/LVS folly of $35 Bn proposal for Europe.  Like the fact that SA/LVS has 3 significant long term locations with 7 casinos eventually in LV and the North East. This can be managed by Wynn group, and Goldstein can manage the international group with CEO emeritus can scoot around in his planes.

"HJK -- Thanks for the update. I'm quite pleased with my investment in LVS, and look forward to your LVS articles.You've offered an interesting LVS/WYNN scenario, even addressing a succession plan for Sheldon Adelson (age 84).

Great analysis.,
"Why will they have to give up the name? Steve Wynn will have trouble getting a license in Vegas, right?",
The deal works Howard.  Just remember when Wynn Macau the new purchaser will have to give up the Wynn and Encore name. This would allow a facility on Parcel 7 and 8 to be resurrected as the Wynn Diamond through LVS or even better replacing the Four Season and St Regis names with the Wynn,
"Thanks for this analysis. Think WYNN floor definitely $160.  Just one point, LVS (or anyone) cannot accumulate over 9.9% without triggering disclosure requirements.

"Howard you are really smart and forward thinking. Now is the time to act while Wynn’s stock is low. Genting and Galaxy could be in the mix as well.

Is the profit real and reflected in the cash flow of the company or are the pulling profits out of thin air by making up tax benefits that really do not exist and excluding expense items under creative accounting and proforma presentation of a not so good quarter?

Abercrombie went for a flagship store concept and is under huge fiancial obligations on leases for large, dingy, stinky empty stores.  While they are trying to change that and not exposing the cost, ANF is under huge debt because they wanted the best location for their empty stores.

"This stock is one of the most undervalued retailers in the entire market.  While American Eagle has just about the strongest fundamentals, consistant earnings, a dividend and growing SS sales, the market chases one of the most troubled and overvalued stocks in this sector in Abercrombie and Fitch (ANF).  Why?  Institutional control of the stock.  Almost all of the float is controlled by hedge funds and instituions.  It is a sad state of the market that ANF can go from 9.00 a share to over 20.00 because of the hype given one single good quarter out of 20 while American continues to put up great numbers while growing sales and profits and remaining undervalued compared to the market and especially this sector.","Apparel Retailer Undervalued Despite Growing Digital, Zero Debt And Surprising Market Share"

Buffett understands debt and bonds and companies,
"I haven’t read the post, but the title is idiotic at most, to call out a firm that understands the credit market second to none in a tone that indicate he knows much better. Buffet may miss some new technology, but he still read credit market much much better than most of us",
"This is an article 7 or 8, and you are very negative about Teva. Buffett is not stupid. He bought a total of 1.8% of the Teva shares at $ 18.95. He will increase the debt. There is already a debt arrangement with regard to Teva's bonds and the banks' .This is an article that should have been written in 2016 and not in 2018,You are very negative about nature, and it seems that you speak out of a pose,Do not forget to have a new general manager.He is very knowledgeable in the field of pharma and has a great deal of knowledge in medicine and accounting,I have written to you more than once, with the program of streamlining + drugs of Teva currently about 1500 drugs + 600 new drugs,There are already 100 certifications with a market value of many millennia then nature the right way,Your accounting for the bonds is not true at all, you're wrong,Every fifth person in the US takes a drug of nature. Nature is still a profitable company. Teva is the largest generic company in the world. They will focus only on what it earns. Which will not be cut or sold. Teva has in the years 2018-2019 to return 7 billion USD. And she would stand there.Which means that Teva will stand with interest rate differentials that you specify around 22 billion debt,With there will be approvals of new drugs so debt will be smaller than all pharmaceutical companies in credit debt.If you see the nature of the debt in 2014.It had future commitments of $ 14 billion before the acquisition of Actwis, which means that at present the debt is $ 32 billion,Teva cut its debt from $ 40.5 billion to $ 32 billion in two years.The debt of the bonds is also spread until 2046.25% of the debt, 75% of the bonds.Only 2 new drugs will be in 2018.The market value of one of them is: 4 billion dollars,Saving employees about $ 3 billion a year,Dividend savings of about $ 1.2 billion a year.Savings in closing factories,And the creature will move to Asia cheaper there. , Nature at these gates is Kenya, There's accounting for everything, and it's not over,The new CEO knows what he's doing and is waiting for surprises.Besides, Teva has properties all over the world.Do not forget it. It's worth a lot of money,This too should be assessed financially.I've doubled my share of nature,I have time, nature within 3 years 60 $,You will have to re-calculate and not write negative,You're no smarter than Buffett.And sure is no smarter than the general manager of Teva Shultz.He does not speak a very discreet man.He's a man of work and he comes to work.And said that he is committed to the shareholders and he is optimistic. Be optimistic too. And do not repeat the same thing many times about something everyone knows.Wait for surprises and do not be negative, a good week",

"I share the view expressed by a reader on another thread...BRK stake may be a longer term plan hatched with Bezos and Dimon...get the largest generic drug maker back in good health, may be make it a portfolio company of new venture later, get a health insurer on board, Amazon filling prescription, delivering as well, and JPM bankrolling. Taking a tiny stake does seem odd though....but TEVA may fit into that grand game plan.",
"SE, I checked the latest results presentation after what @spencet comments. He/she is right. Your numbers are wrong but you chose to remain silent on why you provided wrong info. For the record, 2018 maturity is $2.8b, 2019 is $3.5b and 2020 $4.0b after adjusting for post-results prepayments. So 2018+2019 maturities totaled 6.3b and not the 7.5b figure quoted by you. Management guided $2.6-2.8b FCF and $4.7-5.0b EBITDA for 2018. So maturities for 2018 looks fine. 2019 is further down and a small refi would suffice. Teva is cutting costs and 2019 could see the benefits of cost cutting. Perhaps you could be right about Copoxene or the competitive landscape of generics but one must not take your ""facts"" without checking. You mentioned WB but provided no perspective as to why WB has taken a stake in Teva. This article on Teva is as one-sided as your posts on other stocks which you are negative.",
"Thanks Shock Exchange for your insight. I know people want to be bullish with Teva, because of how much the stock has fallen. The problem is that you can't base your investments based on how much a stock has fallen and what the current value is only. You have to look at other things like you touch up in your article. As well as year over year declines in earnings, trouble with generic pricing etc. I love your piece a lot thanks for the write up.",

"This writer is desperate, so many bearish articles in recent times, someone’s gonna get squeezed real hard.",
"thank you, is there a generic drug stock you do prefer?",
"Shock, The 6.6% YTM is on the 2046 sen unsec bond, right?  It's priced slightly under par right now and has a 6% coupon, right?   And your assumption is TEVA is looking to take ALL of their near term maturities and place them AS FAR OUT on the yield curve as possible so they can pay 6%?  Am I reading you correctly here?  Because I am certain that is NOT what TEVA will do with their maturities.  So if you looked at the latest Q you would have noticed they are placing around 300 mil. against '18, '19 and '20 maturities as of Q4.  We then add in an additional 1.7 bil placed on the 2018 refi in Q1 and Q2.  So they really have less to refi then you report, and some of that will be placed on the revolver which is priced at a spread to Libor and should be just a tick above 3% this year.  That is about a 85bp movement up since last year, accurately reflecting shorter term risks, rates moving higher and inflation expectations.  The other thing you fail to realize is while rating agencies have some impact upon the credit markets, the equity markets are forward looking so the drop in stock price was reflecting something other than a slight move from BBB to BB.  The equity as a forward looking indicator is thinking about TEVA 9 12 months from now and asking the same questions you are asking but they seem to feel much more comfortable than you.  Maybe they realize that TEVAs strategy has a good chance of succeeding.  As a thought experiment think about the life cycle of an LBO.  Every LBO since the '70s has levered up the balance sheet, cut costs, improved efficiency and paid down debt.  In return the shareholders were left with a more efficient company, with less debt and greater equity value.  It didn't work every time, but if you look closely at the record from say a KKR in the 80's I think you will find it was as rewarding an endeavor as one could find in the market.  So as an investor you have to ask yourself this, ""what will TEVA look like in '19 and '20?""  If the answer is they are circling the drain right now and things will continue to deteriorate on a forward basis for years to come, then your assessment is correct.  If, on the other hand, the bad news that you continue to point out in your writings, TEVAs cycle in downward pricing ameliorates this year and they continue to chop away at debt....well under that scenario you will be at a loss.  I find it interesting that when I read your bio I notice a strong sense of altruism (financial literacy program) embedded in the description of your work.  However, I want to challenge you to be fair to people reading these articles who may not have your same set of skills and knowledge about the markets.  In your writings I find that you tend to spin the facts or even conjure up estimates that are flawed on many levels.  I am not asking you to be sanguine about TEVA, but rather give the reader a realistic accounting of the facts.",Teva: Berkshire Thinks Bondholders Are 'Mullet Mullet'

A few thoughts of my own, as an shareholder of ANET, CSCO and several optical networking stocks (although not AAOI).As someone who tries to keep an eye on valuation, ANET's valuation is unarguably high (I bought it in the 60s; it probably wouldn't pass my valuation screens now, even after the drop), but it should be looked at, if you're going to invest at all, relative to the overall market, where pe's in the 20s with zero organic growth are extremely common, not to mention stocks with triple digit pe's with erratic to no earnings (hello AMZN, TSLA, CRM AND NFLX).  ANET's PEG is aggressive but not beyond the pale (consider it vs. CSCO in the late 90s).ANET's market is share is still small with lots of room for growth.  Maybe someone else sees it, but I see zero signs that CSCO is going to stop the advance, let alone take anything back.It's been CSCO's stated policy for some time, which it's more or less stuck to, that it's not going to look to buy competitors; rather, companies in peripheral areas, such as security, apps, etc.  I'd view a CSCO takeover as highly unlikely.AAOI is really inapposite to ANET.  Outside of the customer concentration issue, optical networking stocks are wildly cyclical, like semiconductors on crack; standard networking stocks have not been to anywhere close to the same degree.  (If you have doubts, note that the SOXX finally passed its dotcom high several months ago, but if you put together an index of CIEN, AMCC, FNSR, etc., it would be only a fraction of where it was at that point).  Outside of a general economic slump, ANET's most likely threats seem to me to be either price erosion or a new competitor jumping in.  At the moment, I don't see either.  While I wouldn't be the ranch on this one, I net out about where SU is on this.",
"I guess my overall comment would be, if you have concerns about ANET post stock drop, you should have been much more concerned at $307 (Where I got out-150% lucky, back it at $250).  My point is, the stock dropped.  Absolutely nothing else has changed w this story that is known publicly.  The stock ran up into earnings like crazy.  Sold off after earnings.  That is about the extent of it.  No more cloud Titans?  ANET has 14% US market share in switching, is just entering routing and is just really ramping up out side US.  There is a bit of runway left I would think.",
"I have been looking at this for a while now, afraid to initiate a position.  The concern that I have, as others have already stated, is that they are poking the bear (CSCO).  I find it hard to believe CSCO won't actively try to get its lunch back.  I'll hold off, but might look at some options play.  Great article though, I enjoyed reading it and learning :)",
"Thanks for the articleIf we look at the 2 market share charts, while clearly Arista is gaining at the expense of Cisco, Arista is gaining less in 2017 vs preceding years. And their combined shares at 2017 vs 2012 is also 10 share points lower. That means there are other competitor(s) out there feasting over Cisco lost shares. Anyone knows what company/companies that might be? Another disrupter(s) we have to watch out for?",
"This is one of my winners, even after this correction the stock is still up almost 100% from my entry point and took some profit yet with options. The fundamentals are strong, there is only the theoric risk (like in every investment) that CSCO or another company can become more competitive, but there is nothing concrete for now.",
"There are no more cloud titans to win over. They have to grow via small, medium, and large enterprise sales. Not a small feat.",
"For this level of risk, I'd rather go with something like NVDA or CGNX that IMO have better moats for PE 40+ stocks. For somebody looking for high risk/high reward in the networking hardware industry though, ANET is where it is at.It would be strange if Cisco bought them out considering that most of the Arista leadership team consists of former Cisco employees.",
"Hopefully it won't fall off like AAOI. For one thing its PE is much higher than AAOI and they have a big competitor yet trade at a premium. Cisco is that sleeping giant Arista has been stealing marketshare from.They have been whacking Cisco over the head for a few years now. It's interesting to see Cisco make some positive moves. I'd hold off until things become clearer and stay away from networking stock for a while unless you are quite confident in the technology leadership dominance long term because it is clear those trading in the sector right now are playing momentum rather than fundamentals.By the way, yes, I know AAOI is not in the same market besides being in networking equipment. It is an example of another high flyer that got clobbered for showing reduced growth and the sharp drop off in price after a steady run up is similar enough for me to compare and contrast Arista's chart right now. Sadly logic is not the guiding principal in networking high fliers right now.",
I agree with this article very much. If some know what is ANET he would know this is a nice chance to enter because it hit the bottom.  Arista(ANET) is really decent company to own. We know Cloud business is still beginning with huge potential ahead. One thing we like Arista is insiders own 40% of its stocks. That means Arista is for their livelihood. The company's culture has very strong mentality to win. There is no other way.,
Arista sold off?! How come nobody told me?,

You wrote a great article on a truly outstanding company.

It has definite CAR-T expertise and is ripe for acquisition. BullishCancer trials are never pretty, but I’ve been in labs and I’ve been in clinics, and CAR-T with a kill switch (safety feature of BLCM’s tech) that has gone deep into human clinical trials is, at the very least, evidence that the company has an attractive skill set for future acquisition.

"CHK oil prices are covered for 75% by Us 53 per barrel in 2018 as per CHK statements. So any drop in price would not affect the 2018 revenues as they said.How CHK management could have made such an error by locking in 75% of their oil output since at the November 2017 OPEC closing statements that the oil output was going to be limited to the previous output of 1,1 barrels per day on a word wide bases and Saudi Arabia with others were aiming at a minimum oil price of $70 per barrel in 2018.Why CHK Management were so naif and made such an error of locking in only 75% of their oil production to such a low rate of $ 53  per barrel when they were also fully aware of the geopolitical situation resulting of lower oil output and expanding oil exports at home. They could have reduced locking in only 50 % of their oil production at  $62 in order to reduce their big debts and interest payments. Hopefully they can find something to make this happening !!",
One thing unclear to me is what happened with the property that they wrote down when oil dipped under 35. Where are those fields accounted for and can they be revalued when oil stabilizes say at 65? This issue may bring additional value to the stock.,

so what is the price outlook by the end of the first Q 2018?,
"CHK drilling through its best acreage and selling off property without reducing debt should be a big concern for shareholders. The author fails to mention that CHK pays $700 million in interest cost each year. That is why it will ultimately go belly up amid a significant price recovery in oil and/or gas.If you want a levered play on oil prices, go for CRC. They also receive Brent pricing on it oil",
"CHK is covered 75% by 53$ in 2018. It has already proved that with these prices can make money. So any drop on oil prices should not affect the 2018 revenue.On the other hand, you are talking about debt, debt and debt. Debt has been a constant by  CHK in a decade, I do not see any big concern until 2021. Hope things will be better then. Thanks for sharing your thoughts",

"If they could only get oil up another 15,000 bpd on this budget it would bring in another $320 million to the bottom line at $60 oil...at $70 its even better...",
Another point to be made that I'm not seeing much from SA authors is how we have multiple LNG refineries being developed and I believe 2 that will come online at limited output this year. This will benefit CHK a lot if they manage strong contracts with these facilities. I'm sure they can setup beneficial hedges as well. Just my thoughts happy trading Long CHK folks.,
"This is not the first time CHK has been on the ""comeback trail"".....",

"That risk of another downturn is exactly what is keeping this  stock down. I believe there is a window of opportunity given a price recovery to enter into deals that truly stabilize the company. Sale of the mid-con? The marcellus?  A JV with  Cheniere for the Haynesville production? Whatever the deal, I'd like the proceeds to be dedicated part to debt and part to a meaningful reduction in share count. At these prices, a buyback is a steal and might restore some faith by the shareholders that they are not going to suffer more dilution. They've suffered enough, and for long enough.",

"COHU buyout is bittersweet news.   They snuck in before XCRA reports their quarter, and unless it was a bad quarter this buyout price is an absolute steal for COHU (and frankly a steal regardless).  Once shareholders dig in to this and arbs finish their hedging I would be surprised if COHU price doesn't pick up.  Significant synergies projected close to 20% of the TTM combined EBITDA numbers.  One negative is they are going from unlevered to ~3x levered but they should be able to pay this down relatively quickly.  Personally, I would have preferred an all-stock deal.It will be a while, but really want to see the merger background and comps once the proxy comes out.",

Thank you so much. Your very clear and convincing article made me buy XCRA.,
Needham upgrade to a target of $16 today.,
"CVC, thanks for this.  On the surface the valuation is compelling.  My primary concern is that they do not intend to return any of the cash via buybacks.  When asked during the Friday conference call, this was the response:""I think I've said it in the presentation, but I'll express it. We are going to be extremely aggressive on the M&A front. We not only have $170 million approximate of net cash. You can quickly see based on up stocking positively about the where we go through '18. We're going to generate a lot more cash. It's not it would not surprise me to our net cash if we do nothing to get close to in that rate over $200 million by the end of our fiscal year.So, we will be very aggressive on the M&A front where we make sense for the business. I think it's time for us with all the share gains and all the activities we have underway. It's time to take the next step in the growth of the Company. As far as looking for another partner, that's, those things happened when they happened, if they happened. So that's not we're targeting at this point. It's really how we can we accelerate our growth.""Given their confidence in continued positive FCF and the current low multiples they should be giving stronger consideration to buybacks.  In this regard, Teradyne appears much more shareholder-friendly, and thus deserving of a higher multiple.  I encourage any shareholders with similar thoughts to communicate them to management.",
"Excellent summary and totally agree with everything stated.  After agreeing to the merger almost a year ago, the semi equip market got significantly stronger, and those companies multiples expanded during last year.  XCRA missed all that multiple expansion as it was capped by the takeover price.  Fundamentals remain stable to strong.  They are generating good free cash flow, with mgmt. stating they will be over $200m in cash in 2 quarters.  I think they should buy back some of the stock at these levels - maybe 2-3 million shares or roughly 5% outstanding.  They will still be left with a war chest of cash for accretive acquisitions.  There were 3 upgrades on Friday but it gave up the gains late.  Maybe there were some merger arb guys in the stock that needed to exit now that the takeover is off.  But I think the $15 target is a good one at roughly 12x ests of $1 plus $3 in net cash.  Once mgmt. can get on the road and show their results to investors I believe it will get to $15 in short order.  They haven't been able to have conf calls or investor presentations due to the merger - so mgmt hitting the road and meeting with mutual funds (hopefully soon) should bear fruit.",

That all said, I have watched their operations and commitment to service decline over the last year or so.

"This is such a biased article it isn't funny.  Intel is being threatened big time, even at the high end.  First of all, the only benchmark this article uses as a performance reference is Passmark, which everyone knows is a horrible benchmark to use.  Secondly, the benchmark puts Intel's best server CPU's up against only an AMD Threadripper, which isn't more of an enthusiast desktop CPU as opposed to a server CPU.  Keep in mind that AMD's EPYC CPU's are their server line of CPU's.  An Intel Platinum 8173M is a 28-core server CPU, however, AMD has 32-core EPYC CPU's that can actually out perform Intel's best.  Third, is the fact that AMD offers 128 lanes of PCI-Express lanes compared to a maximum of only 48 for the Intel Xeon CPU.  That is where AMD absolutely obliterates Intel and especially in the data-center environment, where cloud computing, AI, and systems of the future are dependent on parallel processing, where GPU's are utilized to provide incredible amounts of compute performance, and having 128 lanes of PCIE allows a 1P system to use almost 3x the amount of GPU's at a full 16x each, or almost 4x the amount of GPU's at 8x each, which is a more efficient way to go, as running 16x over 8x only offers about 5-8% difference per card.  And there you have it....that is why the more knowledgeable analysts out there, believe that AMD's potential to disrupt the datacenter market over 2018 and 2019 is extremely high.  The fact that AMD EPYC CPU's are less susceptible to Meltdown and Spectre is also in its corner.",
"While I am bullish on Intel in the near term, to say AMD is not a threat is just a terrible misstep. It is how Intel got caught flat-footed, to begin with. Did the author not read Intel's last ER guidance at all? They even gave clear warning signs off the bumpy road ahead. Two of which I mention below. Intel has not needed to maintain a new CPU on a year to year basis because AMD was always so far behind. Now, however, Intel has to fend off competition while maintaining market share. Intel has slower multi-thread CPUs than AMD and that is NOT good for Intel. Intel should be thanking the heavens that a majority of games still focus their performance off a single thread count, otherwise, AMD would be eating Intel's lunch. The author makes ZERO mention of Intel's Meltdown / Spectre lawsuits. One lawsuit against Intel is $5 billion. We also won't know the full impact of Intel CPU market until EOY or Q3. It is easy to be bullish or bearish about a company, but it is much harder to look at both sides. Ignoring AMD isn't just a mistake, but dangerous.",

Intel is down to its server business as its primary profit center and this is being challenged by both AMD with high quality, cost efficient chips that are x86 binary compatible and new big-iron ARM CPUs / platforms. The rest of its businesses are low margin and highly speculative with substantial competition: Altera rides second fiddle to Xilinx in the FPGA space, mobile eye faces challenges from nVidia and Google, its modem division has consistently underperformed Qualcomm's with hardware manufacturing being very low margin and licensing where the profit is made. I think in the end, its heyday of restrictive x86 licensing and fabrication advantages are almost gone, but it can deristrict licensing and open its fabs as a last resort. Perhaps a spinoff of the fab business is appropriate. I wouldn't advocate a short at this juncture, but an investment seeking growth is wholly inappropriate.",

Even on its home turf in South Korea Apple doubled its market share to almost 30% last year, and Samsung plunged 9% to 51%.Worldwide, Apple is the number one by revenues (51%) with Samsung a distant second place. By profits, Apple hoovers up 90% of the smartphone market, even with only a 17% market share by units.90% of iPhone users buy another iPhone. That’s double the rate of android users, which is illustrated by the shocking loss of market share by Samsung at the medium to premium end of the market in countries like South Korea. Samsung users are switching to iPhone, not vice versa. The author’s assertion that unlike Apple, Samsung is diversified suggests an anti-Apple bias for whatever reason - I’m not sure what the point of the article was to be honest. Was it to show why Samsung can sell 30M units of its new phone or to say Samsung is a stronger company than the largest most successful company in the world, namely Apple? The author should also note that Apple’s dependency on iPhone revenues is falling as the growing service and “Other” categories are growing at a 20-50% clip depending which sub-segment you look at, and the iPhone will represent just 40% or so next year, as the Mac and iPad (about 20%) support the growth of services and accessories, which over the next 5 years will likely grow to represent into 40% of revenues on their own.Apple is well diversified. Samsung’s phones are losing market share, a situation unlikely to change any time soon as it’s been a building phenomenon.",

"I see in previous posts back in March that several (including you) had correctly pegged the future ( I.e., now) correctly... you saw a bad conf call with bad news and correctly called DAIO’s stock weakness and even price (I see $6 in a couple notes).Superb.!!I saw weakness , but not the drubbing and dumping that has occurred. Further, I did not at all see the $.02 eps in Q1 driven by opex. Nor did I see the ugly Q2 that is right in front of us ( I’m guessing revenues BELOW Q2 of 2017... that’s right...BELOW).That said, the new biz model has the chance to be a game changer. I see the stock staying north of 6 for the next 6 months. I’ll bet there will be 3-5 additional Sentrix deployments in Q2. THe recurring rev model will start to materialize in Q4 ( but Q4 won’t be reported until Feb 2019). From there... we gain traction.The old model of bookings, back orders and deferred rev is dead. The new model will be Sentrix platforms “installed” and projected bytes programmed. My math says the following based on Anthony’s comments that byte growth will be near 40% per year....Take the 40% unit growth...discount the price per programmed byte by 20% (industry will not accept a 1 for 1 relationship...they’ll want price concessions)...DAIO ends up with 20% growth per quarter for as far as the eye can see.In the meantime, I am interested and sincerely wanting when you think a technical bottom has been put in. I can, and have, been blinded before by DAIO. My thoughts and arguments have been wrong over 18 years😌. Thx",
"Hello to all. I make the following comments and thoughts... 1. In my 18 years with this stock I have never been more bullish than I am now.2. My formula for revenues “was right” , but I had NO IDEA the open would be what it was in Q1... and hence the dramatic reduction in net income.3. I had NO IDEA of this biz model shift...I’m totally caught off guard... but after reflection and some rational thought, feel this singular strategy will , with time, catapult DAIO to all time highs (and I’ll go on a limb here and say near end 2019 and 1st half2020.)4. I was pissed ,and still am, with Anthony’s “ bed side manners”   In so bluntly and without warning broadcasting the softness at programming centers and now with this new business model... does he not understand how to coach investors through transitions... I don’t give him high marks here... but I do get my juices flowing at the notion of recurring revenues versus capex sales.5. My old model of arriving at sales and eps is DEAD!!!6. Q2 2018 and beyond will be driven by some capex sales, heavy opex in the form of r&d and marketing/biz dev and a wild card variable called recurring/subscription revenues.7. The p&l will suffer until recurring revs hit a critical inflection point (my wild guess???...$1.0 million per quarter)8. Here’s the game DAIO is playing... and I believe they are targeting a “winner take all” roll the dice game...but the odds are in their favor... DAIO is going to offer all electronic IoT and Auto programming businesses a risk free pass... take our Sentrix equipment for $0 upfront. In exchange...you pay us a small monthly or yearly fee AND WE GET A SMALL PAYMENT for every IC or micro controller you program...think of it like a credit card user fee of 3% on each and every purchase.This approach is a game changer (but not without initial pain).In DAIO’s investor presentations over the last several years they have a slide showing the number of secure units needed in the billions...then you have to add expected auto growth in terms of byte expansion from terabytes to zetabytes... I’m guessing the complexity of byte growth alongside security provisioning and programming leads to billions upon billions of IC’s and MCU’s needing to be programmed...and DAIO’s new business model swipes what??...say a nickel per device?... Run the math...9. Programming centers should be licking their chops...NO upfront capital commitment and they only pay when they do what they do...that is, program parts!!! That’s a no risk proposition and directly addresses what Anthony said of the cc...that is Programming Centers tend to be more reactive to unforeseen, out-of-nowhere orders and are “last minute” reactive... hence NO VISIBILITY for DAIO....all that goes away with a lease/subscription/pay per program model. 10. I suggest we try to comprehend the nature of the 2 mega, secular drivers of DAIO’s various customer base... those drivers are the desire for greater functionality (byte and code growth) and making all that functionality “hacker safe”. What DAIO is doing is investing in their business (I.e., their machines, equipment) to handle the byte/code growth whilst SIMULTANEOUSLY reconfiguring their business model (on the call, Joel calls this their go-to-market strategy) to give their customers a RISK FREE approach to lower programming cost with SECURITY built in.11. It’s a huge bet!!! That said, they have already secured 2 major customers for SENTRIX and have partnered with leaders in their ecosystem...and more partners to come.12. I see $1-$1.50 per share eps somewhere between 2019 and 2020. How do I get there? Simple... $1.50 per share with 8.5 million shares says DAIO needs $12.75 million after tax. If I assume DAIO get $.025 (2.5 cents) per device programmed... we need DAIO equipment to program 510,000,000 devices... in a world of 5 billion devices...we need 10% share. I see no reason this cannot happen. And I could make an arguement that this calculation is extremely conservative13. Next steps or what to watch for? First, future revenues... is the per byte/unit business model being adopted (specifically...number of SENTRIX deployments). second... who else joins the DAIO ecosystem????? TXN? INTC? Qualcomm? Programming Centers??( Avnet, Jabil, Flextronics, etc). I agree with Anthony that Renasas, Infineon, Cypress, Maxim, IAR, NXP, Secure Thingz are impressive (I leave ARM out of this because that’s really not a “partnership” per se). We can expect eps for Q2 and Q3 to suck. BUT!!!!...that’s not the “game” right now... the game is revenues from the new business model... my old calculation model is over and done... throw it in the garbage.... we now need to develop a new one...rooted in recurring revenue.I think the stock is dead money for 3 months and likely 6. Once we see the top line mojo gaining traction...get ready to pounce with your money.Sorry for long winded. I’m all in on DAIO... all in.

My bet is on CHTR and John Malone as they are the best positioned without the overhang of content plays such as CMCSA.The linear TV model is in secular decline, holding onto these assets is very problematic hence my preference for CHTR versus CMCSA.

"Thanks for the article. Pandora also trades OTC as PANDY and I bought at mid 23 (now 25). I think some patience will be in order for a while, but over time, Pandora will succeed in penetrating a mix of worldwide marketplaces with an operation it mostly controls (owns). Of particular noteworthiness, is how it is penetrating the China market via online Tmall - targeting the 25-35-year-old demographic, partnering with celebrities like actress Ivy Chen, and on the ground it has more than 100 stores there, and has only begun to grow its China presence.Pandora entered China in 2011 and It represents a small but rapidly growing percentage of Pandora's overall sales up to this point in time. The current price point undervalues Pandora's big potential. The main negative point is that the business model must hedge against commodity silver/gold price movement (a silver spike would prove painful) and building out the brand franchise in various countries for more control will be capex heavy. So if commodity prices spike in the coming years, it will present a drag with bumps along the road (compared to more established players like Tiffany). But the business model appears solid with healthy cash-flows and so I agree with your article... the current price is a very reasonable low entry point.

"Best way to serve shareholders and to avoid tax: Spin off the Tencent shares into the accounts of the shareholders. They've done so with novus holding shares. May be a test run. Or they could spin off all the rest in to an Newco and distribute the sahres of Newco to the shareholders.Each Naspers shareholder then could decide to (i) hold the Tencent holding company share, and sell the Newco shares  (ii) other way round or (iii) hold both replicating the old Naspers structure.",
"I suggest listening to the Investor Day webcast on company website, especially the CFO section at the end and CEO at beginning. They acknowledge that the stock should always trade at some discount, perhaps 20%, but this current discount is too much. They also point to the 22.4% withholding tax on distributions for the proceeds of asset sales. There is no intent to sell Tencent. The idea above to sell small amounts each year and use proceeds to buy back Naspers stock is a good one, IMO.Long NPSNY, but not in major way. I need more comfort in fundamentals and valuation of Tencent, which had more than doubled in a year. Want to make sure I’m buying Tencent at a reasonable price through Naspers, and not simply getting an excessive discount to an assset with significant downside risk. Sarel, have you seen good Tencent research that makes you comfortable with it?",
"Great article Sarel.In my view perception of SA by international investors has a lot to do with the discount. Local fund managers and pension funds are constrained by reg 28 from buying as much as they would like.

He has made a good start.I for one, use every spare Rand I earn to load up with more as the tension between real value and perception won’t last forever.",
Totally agree on the buyback reducing the shares outstanding in a meaningful way never fails.,
"This has looked compelling for a long time but two things keeping me out:1. Tencent is arguably overvalued by the amount Naspers is undervalued. (Note: arguably. I know the bullish case so you can save the effort. I still don't know. Your confidence and bluster are not going to change that).2. Uncertain tax implications when they liquidate the Tencent position. Everybody has a different opinion on what will happen. Some say no taxes, some say a lot of taxes. This makes a huge difference.If and when these two become more clear (to me, not to you), I'll be in for sure.",
I think Pony has is plan maybe he uses naspers as a Vehicule for investments a chinese company couldn’t think of.. who knows but naspers is unloved and everyone knows china controls South Africa. There is no point in Tencent buying Naspers they are in growth mode. 33% less share in circulation means less volatility.. they know they won’t sell.,
Tcehy should buy Naspers. It would be like a stock buy back at a 40% discount.,
Yea....but.  S Africa is problematic.,
I like the idea of forgoing the DIV. for buy-backs!!! Long $TCEHY and $NPSNY !!!,
"I continue to believe Naspers should announce and then sell 1% of their Tencent stake a year and use the proceed to buy Naspers stock (as long as the discount is over 25%).  This would serve 3 functions.1) they get a great return on their investment - buying shares at a 40% (now) discount.2) this would reduce the discount (boosting shareholders investments)3) while Tencent is a great investment, owning a stock that is >100% of your value is a crazy situation.  Sure it lets the CEO bank huge ""incentive"" payments just on Tencent delivering great returns but that is not enough of to justify such a strange arrangement.  They need to reduce their Tencent holdings (even following my strategy is just barely going to move the needle in reducing how dependent they are on Tencent).  If they want to remain just a proxy for Tencent they should just spin off the tiny appendage of other businesses and make Naspers 100% Tencent proxy instead of the weird 105% + other stuff proxy it is now.I own Naspers and Tencent (though less Tencent directly).  I believe Naspers can be a good company, especially if they focus on both some good internet businesses globally and some Africa specific opportunities (where they can have added value over other businesses).  But they need to reduce Tencent holdings from the over 100% of Naspers value it has now.Selling a tiny bit of Tencent each year and buying back Naspers stock would do this and get a great return on the discounted Naspers shares.But if they won't do that, they should start paying a dividend in Tencent stock to shareholders - pay say .01 share of Tencent stock as an annual dividend (so 1 Tencent share to you each year for every 100 shares you own).  Yes this is a bit weird, but it is weird to have a company that has an investment worth more than the entire company (so it isn't so surprising an option to deal with that is strange).  If they decide the annual dividend were too bothersome, then do a 1 time dividend of .1 shares of Tencent for each Naspers share owned.",

"Same old stuff. The chart show iPhone sales increasing, not stagnating. You just have see FY'15 as an anomaly, based on long overdue larger screens and opening up China.Sure iPhone sales growth will be modest to flat going forward. But remember the Mac was officially pronounce dead 2 decades ago by the pundits. Still growing and still profitable.Lower margins are great. Who cares? At today's stock price, Apple can buy back shares to make up the EPS impact. Plus high margin Services and App business will pull up margins. Eventually Apple will fix Siri (Let's all agree it's way overdue) and figure out video content delivery (Let's agree this needs work too.) Fix these two and that HomePod makes up it's margin on content delivered. That works.",
Sanjay Jha is that you??,
"Rohit,You are leaving out the most important part of this story.Apple is maintaining their margins by getting the component prices down.

"Perhaps I bought my iPhone X because I just couldn't hold out anymore, but man am I glad I did; the ease of use, the functionality, the ability to connect with Apple products is just astounding. And I'm buying into the cross-connectivity to other Apple products, because if I were to design the functionalities of the products I own, I would design it exactly the same way. And I would be happy to spend more in achieving that goal. . Apple is a conservative company with conservative leadership, exactly the kind of company I like to own. Their new research center, will move well beyond our desktop, our lap, our wrists, our foreheads and on into medicine, science and areas we can't even imagine yet. Let them be, watch and we will all thank them from a new perspective one day. .I recall a company who once stated 'Don't Do Evil' and now they are the most invasive company in the search field arena by far, while Apple is truly doing good things. I don't use G to search, haven't for a long time, I use DuckDuckGo and Bing. And I will continue to both support and be rewarded by AAPL.",
According to my analysis the cost of the HomePod is much less than your figures.,
HomePod isn’t the true product: it’s a gateway to future products and services (home automation),
"This phase of Apple’s existence reminds me of 2008-2009, when iPod sales were falling... articles exclaimed: “What is Apple to do?”  They were already doing it, the iPhone was replacing the iPod.  If you truly believe that the iPhone is the dead end for Apple, the company will be ok, although probably underperform the NASDAQ as a whole.  That’s hard to believe though, when you look at the up and coming sectors of their “one trick pony” lineup.  Wearables and services will continue to propel the company, and likely the stock as well, given the insane amount of FCF they generate - and the shareholder friendly things they do with it.  Appreciate all the negativity though... it’s provided me many entry points over the years.",
"Schiz,  Apple is not looking to you to be a customer.  If you are holding your phone for ten years or buy old, discounted products, nobody is making any money off of you.  I’m not saying there is anything wrong with your spending habits but I will point out that Tim Cook is not putting his brain power in trying to figure out how to produce a no margin product so you will carry one of his phones.  The name of the game is to make a profit and it appears that Apple has figured out how to do that very well.  I am 64 years old and recently bought an iPad Pro, great for reading SA and for doing art work.  I don’t believe that because I am of a certain age that I shouldn’t keep abreast of current technologies.  The world moves on and I intend to do that too.  I’m hoping I’ll be able to afford to do that based on my investment in Apple.Good luck to all in their investing and their technology upgrades.  :)",
"I own some Apple stock, but have never owned an Apple product. I am 62 years old and have a $40 LG smart phone. I can make phone calls, text messages, and have a golf app and running app on it. I also use it to look something up on the internet on rare occasions. I have no reason to spend several hundred dollars on a phone.I also own an Amazon Echo that was on sale during Christmas for $30. I could have bought one for every room in my house for less than the cost of one Hompod The Homepod only works if you own an IPhone or an IPad. So that limits its market quite a bit already. If Apple wants to be able to sell these things, the cost of production is not the main determinant of price. It is the price of the competition and how much premium people are willing to pay over other options. You cannot use BOM data on the Hompod and assume that it is a precuror for lower IPhone pricing in the near future.",
Nice article.   The Google Home Max has 66% margins.    The problem for Apple is Google is able to get the better sound with less cost using AI.http://read.bi/2F3v7azApple probably makes less profit on the HomePod than Google and ...,

Look out for AAPL Project Titan. That should be the product line bringing AAPL past the trillion market cap.,
The margin on one product in a competitive market outside their core competency is irrelevant for a company whose core products are the standard of comparison in their market.,

Meanwhile... the stock just keeps rolling. :),
At $549 Apple would have sold dozens of Homepods by now.,
Looks like the shorts are getting squeezed hard in places where it hurts the most due to the strong bounce back in AAPL over the last few weeks. People probably bought some puts when Apple dipped to $151 after the earnings. I would recommend just cut your loses as this Juggernaut is moving past $180 soon.,
OMG... this author is not very bright.  Please do read what JP24 says above.Regarding Apple's GROSS MARGIN....Did the author even do the math on the HomePod?  Did anyone as SA do the math???Apple's gross margin has been very close to a 37-38% range for quite a while now.  IF (huge if) Bloomberg BOM is accurate the GROSS MARGIN for the HomePod is 38%.  DO YOU HEAR ME AUTHOR???  I'm sorry but I need to scream it.  Maybe it will sink in.,
"You are not addressing the repatriation and how Apple will use this money to benefit its shareholder?  Apple will always be a successful company, even though you have chosen not to own it.",
"Your assumption that Bloomberg's Bill of Material guesstimates are at all accurate is your downfall. You further assume that products in Apple's product line have to have the same margins. They do not. Who ever told you they did? Not Apple. Not any business or Economic Class I've ever taken or taught established that as a LAW of either business or economics. There isn't even a government regulation requiring it. Some things and products that Apple makes and does have no margins at all. They do them because they add value to their other products that DO have a margin and they understand this value added concept. As such, they may be treated as a cost of manufacturing or an overhead of sales of that product. Also, introductory margins can be lower than margins for more mature products as development costs are amortized and manufacturing costs are lowered with experience.",
"At best, this analysis is incredibly weak. At worst, it's intentionally misleading. The author quotes the BOM costs (reportedly) with the selling price of the HomePod to make his point. These numbers, of course, are used to calculate Gross Margins. He then displays a graph of the ""falling"" Operating Margins. While Gross Margins are obviously an important component of Operating Margins, they are simply components. The fact is that Gross Margins have been virtually flat (at a remarkable 37-39% rate) during the last few years. Operating Margins have declined to some degree due, at least in a large part, to the increase in R&D investment. Nevertheless, Operating Margins continue to be in the mid to high 20s. Which, it itself, is pretty remarkable for a business this size. The author also seems to imply that maybe Apple is, or should be, adopting an Amazonian style approach to the market. An Amazon, by the way, who just wowed investors by raising Operating Margins to 3%.Total garbage. Anyone who does not understand something as basic as the difference between Gross Margins and Operating Margins should not be investing.",

Unit sales at the expense of margin is not a bad stratagem,
I hope all of you are right,
Here we go again ... “Apple is doomed” even with rising ASPs and revs. Bait.,
Bad management at Apple!,
"Apple had to sell the Home Pod at $349, otherwise it couldn't compete with Amazon's Echo and Google. Both Amazon and Google also underpriced their devices. Apple was late to the party and it priced lower than costs because it had to.As fas as the rest of the article. Don't believe what Tim Cook says. He misrepresents facts all the time. Apple is under pricing pressure. The lower sales of iPhoneX, stagnating sales in China, market saturation in the US and Europe. Apple needs another ""big wave"" product. Home Pod is not it.",
"Even if this BOM estimate is correct, I doubt it will have any impact on future iPhone pricing because you're comparing apples and oranges. The iPhone is basically a computer in your pocket. It has a top of the line screen, processor, camera, and other features that are easy to market and differentiate. Apple made a strategic decision. They know that the HomePod is basically just a really nice speaker that you can talk to. There's not much more you can say about it. When other companies are selling basically the same thing with arguably better AI for less than $150, $349 is a pretty tough sell...let alone $549. Apple's play right now is basically ""well, it's a REALLY nice speaker."" And it is, about $350 worth of nice perhaps. Apple knows that Siri isn't really as robust as Amazon or Google's AI assistants, so they've made a speaker product that is also competitive with Bose or Sonos on price and sound quality. $549 would have priced it out of both the AI assistant and mid-range speaker markets. There wouldn't be any justification for that price.",
"iPhone X will be supplanted by the next gen OLED phones. Technology simply does not stand still and with the direction taken in the memory sector by companies like WDC, MU, INTEL, NVIDIA, then very soon phones will have solid state memory at the terabyte level.As processor speed, 5 G networks, and advanced memory chipsets are introduced, your iPhone X will be nothing more than a historical pivot point. Today obsolescence can be measured in technology in months.",

I can’t wait until iPhone X Plus starts at $1099 and Apple further increases iPhone ASP.I also can’t wait until iPhone SE is lowered to $299.,
"If there is one thing I am relatively confident about, its that no one on the outside really knows what Apples strategy is for just about anything let alone pricing.",
"Sorry, but even if the BOM numbers were true the strategy to break into area were they do not compete would be the reason for lower margins.  As they increase unit sales and take some market share they will also gain efficiency on the BOM and increase margins.  You can't equate one fringe product line to their entire portfolio of products that have a completely different market presence and dynamic.",
"Just a little reminder.... Apple is the only outfit out there with ANY pricing power.    Most of the people who buy Apple hardware aren't just buying the hardware.

No thanks.Apple will still be capturing the majority of profits in any sector it desires for a long time.  And while they do that in hardware, services will grow at a nice clip.",
"Not enough units will sell to materially move the needle.  Besides, they can take a hit on Homepod margins if they are simply platforms to increase high-margin iTunes and services revenue.",
Your whole premise is based on the Bloomberg BOM estimates to be factual. No company has the purchasing power of Apple so I am a bit skeptical of the $216 BOM estimate.,
"Absolute nonsense ..., remember when Apple inc. could not possibly sell iPads under $1000, when they cam in way under that. IPhone X has increased the ASP by about $100 and new iPhones have consistently averaged over $600 ever since introduction in 2007.

"Keith, ANAB excluded patients with moderate to severe peanut allergies. 46% success for patients with less than moderate allergies. Lol, that data is nothing compared to AIMT. You sure did pick a winner. ANAB just revolutionized a Benadryl lol",
Any updates on Aimmune?,
"Keith, thanks for a well written article on AIMT. You were spot on with your KITE call, so this one also likely has a chance to be another multi bagger given the data they presented and the unmet needs in a large market. When do you expect your price target of $160 could be reached on AIMT?",
"Saw a RR that stated that one reaction requiring and EPI, did not affect breathing etc and may have been an individual who should of not qualified for the trial.....   So, hopefully that stuff will come out in the conference next week...",
"This one is as close as you get to a slam dunk at the FDA. The risk of living with a nut allergy is significantly higher than taking this therapy. One reaction requiring epi is excellent. This company is at the top of more than one pharma companies buy list. It won't be long, $70 minimum price.",
I think the what has really caused this share to plummet is AnaptysBio releasing their interim phase 2 results the Saturday before Aimmune released its results. To investors that showed IL-33 inhibitor worked and that is what has caused sentiment to shift. Eager to hear others thoughts,
"Comments from a board certified allergist. This is not medical advice. After successful desensitization, why would a family want to spend $400 a month indefinitely for the prescription product, when they can have the kid take two peanuts per day for about five dollars a year?  I am interested to see what percent of patients using the oral product developed eosinophilic esophagitis. I would imagine that condition will be much less common in patients who wear the patch.  I have done about 10 desensitization's to peanut using peanut flour, off label of course, and one patient had to stop because of eosinophilic esophagitis.",
"Like Spread""eagle"" better...I also agree that someone buys them out eventually.  Rightly or wrongly I compare AIMT to SAGE.  I see the demand for SAGE's PPD drug with large mkt potential but I think AIMT's mkt potential is bigger, more urgently needed & more likely to materialize.  As someone who has an allergy & has had an anaphylactic shock, no parent is going to pass up the opportunity to safeguard their children with this therapy.  They still have to carry an epipen around with them but this is an added measure to protect against trace amounts  of peanuts. AIMT is targeting the biggest mkt (children) ANAB is targeting adult mkt only at this time.   I just saw that they finished the secondary offering.  Maybe this puts a floor on the share price.",
Thanks for the article & all the comments on the bewildering price action.  I am long but fear we might visit $26 a share soon.  Something seems amiss.,
I wish AIMT  and their long term investors well. They seem to have done a great job on peanut allergy - first real success with great efficiency as far as I can tell.,
"I think informed investors are connecting the dots early and thinking that if successful, ANAB drug could make AIMT obsolete already, so long term value or AIMT drug could be drastically reduced. ANAB drug is a new class of drug which is in prove it stage. If it works, it will work across many indications and population. I don't think informed investors are looking at what the two companies are saying currently as far as targeted indications and population. I am waiting for ANAB peanut data before deciding to invest in ANAB and/or AIMT or not.",
"I have been burned badly a few times when I was totally convinced after doing my own DD (which included reading very optimistic SA articles with little info on major risks) that the stock is way undervalued and being manipulated. Unfortunately, in basically every case, it turned out the I didn't know the whole story and risks, but some professional and hedge funds knew.I was looking into AIMT and was about to buy last friday, but I passed because the price action after great news looked a lot like those I got burned badly on. My bet is AIMT sold off on good news because of ANAB phase 2 results for peanut allergy will be announced in March, and there is  a high probability that the data will be good with better efficiency and safety - based on recent results on another indication. Instead of visiting doctor office every 2 weeks for 6 months then on maintenance for AIMT drug, ANAB med may require only 1-3 applications a year. So there is a big risk for AIMT investors if ANAB results are stellar.  If ANAB results are not good or clearly superior, then I am sure AIMT will take off again.",
AIMT is a screaming buy at any price below 32. Patient and unemotional investors who buy AIMT with a good margin of safety will be greatly rewarded in the long run. DBVT is also severely mispriced and I'm accumulating there too. Both of these companies deserve a huge round of applause for their innovation and recent accomplishments. This is a huge breakthrough for food allergy sufferers.,
"Keith, per my previous message, is there any concern for AIMT longs about the soon to be announced results of ANAB phase two peanut allergy trial?  Larry",
"The results for AR101 were quite impressive, but I would describe the large peanut allergy market share that you're expecting AIMT to capture as irrational exuberance. I have 2 kids with peanut allergies. I would rather have my kid wear a patch than take a pill any day. The DBV viaskin patch safety profile and ease of use is so impressive that pediatricians and family doctors would be able to prescribe it. The patch also increases in efficacy over time. The DBVT REALISE safety trial results were quite phenomenal. The recent FDA feedback received by DBV technologies regarding proceeding with their BLA submission based on their available data is very promising. If FDA had any concerns about the strength of their data, they DEFINITELY would have demanded that DBV conduct an additional phase 3 trials.  The 15 percent lower limit confidence interval that was pre-specified for the PEPITES study was something that was arbitrarily decided upon. Many people fail to realize that the FDA has approved 2 other allergy drugs that did not meet this 15 percent lower limit (Odactra for dust mite allergy being 1 of them). I foresee, DBV capturing 70 percent of the peanut allergy market and AIMT capturing the remaining 30 percent. It is also easy to forget that DBVT has a phase 2 milk allergy product due to report in 1H 2018. When dealing with treating kids, superior safety trumps efficacy any day. I do plan to initiate a long position in AIMT shortly as I believe the shares are undervalued. The fall in the stock price following the results release (offering or not) is manufactured and represents stock manipulation by MMs at its best. They want to accumulate shares of this stock at a lower price. They cannot allow the price to rise too fast. In the process they are shaking out the weak hands. For anyone with a long term investment horizon, AIMT is a winner. Good luck to all.",
"All data looks so good and convincing, but ""the tops"" unloaded $24.5M worth of shares since July '17, and keep selling. Major red flag for me.",
"Keith, I loved your article.  I see that some time this quarter ANAB is announcing their phase two peanut allergy trial results.  Obviously, they are two years or so behind AIMT, but is this one a potential concern at all?  Thanks.  Larry",
$160 might have been possible until management botched the offering. What a way to drop the ball. Had they let the stock run for a few days before announcing an offering it could have been at $50+ no problem right now.Now $160 is going to take a bit more work.,
Keith I think every option bought before the news is a money loser - call or put.  I am glad I sold my June 40 calls before the news for a tiny profit.  The premium was outrageous.,

"And one more thing. Some posters on other boards are saying why pay for this treatment. Just get some generic peanut powder and do it yourself. Way cheaper. To those folks I say, next time you need penicillin, instead why don’t you just get some blue cheese mold and rub it on the wound? Good luck.",
"On other message boards I’m seeing people poo poo this result as useless and saying no one will buy it. Well, one of my granddaughters has peanut allergy. Many people who don’t have direct contact with someone with a peanut allergy don’t understand how serious a kid’s reaction is when a tiny bit of peanut reside is accidentally ingested. You send them off to places you can’t be with them: school, birthday parties, camping trips, etc. You make them carry an epi-pen and hope that everyone there will know what to do. But you worry. It can be life or death. The host of the party knows about the allergy and so scoops vanilla ice cream for your kid. No peanuts? Wrong. The scoop had peanut residue from scooping the other flavor ice cream. Your kid can’t breathe. Yes this happened to my granddaughter. Epi-pen to the rescue. For parents of a peanut allergy kid, this treatment is a no brainer. The treatment keeps the kid safe if accidentally exposed.Thanks for this article, Keith, and I’m very thankful for AIMT getting this done.",
"People fail to recognize a very good aspect for AIMT's drug is that they will file a BLA (biological licensing application) instead of a NDA (new drug application).  If the active ingredient of AR101 were a small synthetic compound, they would have to file a NDA.  The unfavorable thing with a NDA is that FDA will grant a maximum of 7.5 years of regulatory exclusivity during which period no generics are allowed to launch, ONLY IF AIMT is the first to get FDA approval for this active ingredient.  In other words, if  DBVT's approval which involves the same active ingredient comes first (which is very likely) in a NDA situation, then AIMT will have a very limited FDA regulatory exclusivity, and generics may launch soon after its approval.Very fortunately for AIMT, AR101's active ingredient is a natural protein not a small synthetic compound, and they can file a BLA which is associated with a 12 year exclusivity -- meaning they don't have to worry about generic competitions for at least 12 years, even if there is no patent protection of AR101.",
"An excellent article. They are a turn-key investment for any mega cap pharma company. Aimmune has perfected mass production of AR-101 with the help of Nestle. They have secured the rights to the peanut protein by awarding Golden Peanut shares of the company. While nothing is guaranteed when it comes to the FDA, there should be no problems getting BLA approval. They will obviously go for a much higher premium once approved.Regardless, I’m happy if they stay independent. I see a combo regimen in the future with AR-101 and Regeneron/Sanofi’s Dupixent. This will address the population who couldn’t tolerate AR-101. Their platform is efficacious and they are working on applying it to other food allergies.",

"what people miss with all of these attempted product launches by other companies is product quality. before buying FIZZ over a year ago (I sold my stake to buy a home), I bought all the competitors drinks and blind tested. la croix is the best on flavor. some of these drinks are actually gross. marketing can win short term, but quality always wins long term in categories where quality can differentiate, so long as there is enough marketing to build a brand story. my opinion, of course.people miss that la croix is an ancient beverage in this category. they've had a long long time to perfect.bubly is not as good. the day I taste a comparably good flavored sparkling water from a big player is the day I go bearish on fizz. but even in that case, fizz has a great moat entrenched, and the bear case would be weak and slow. as I wrote a year ago, this drink makes fizz a safe long term investment.",

If you take valuable content off the platform until the season is over you loose what makes hulu (regular ad version - not live streaming) different from NFLX. Case study: Grey's Anatomy. You can watch every single back episode of Greys on NFLX except for the current season... if you want the current season - where do you go - you go buy cable or you can get on Hulu which has (at least the 5 trailing episodes). There is no gaurentee that the users watching it on Hulu would have watched it live if it wasn't an option so its hard to really know how much it is cannibilizing the platform. Hulu doesn't have enough original content yet to start pulling off valuable IP from the networks that back it plain and simple. They will keep investing in OG content and then they will be able to pull some of there content back just like NFLX is doing - either way it is a costly affair that investors need to be ready for.   I also disagree that four options is too much. Users want choice - I don't want to be forced to purchase the Showtime add on and I'm willing to sit through some adds to save a few bucks. If you shrink the options you raise the price - its a simple as that and Hulu isn't really at a point competitively that it could sustain major price hikes. There is a different between the hell that is buying cable packages and choosing three things - Do I Want Live TV, Do I Want Commercials, and Do I Want Premium Add on Channels. That's pretty simple.  The parks add on idea is a bit of a stretch and I don't really think that is something that DIS would ever do (maybe a free month would work or something). I think they will lean in and funnel more content onto the platform and to the extent they can pull DIS (ABC content) off of NFLX and put it exclusively on Hulu. Additionally, the recent Spotfiy / Hulu deal for students was a great hook to bring in customers. As a young person myself, when I read that deal I signed up immediately and when that $5 deal runs out I will likley keep paying because I love the service.  Just my thoughts. Thanks for the article.",
"I think that I, along with a lot of other people, are on the sidelines waiting for Disney's streaming service and, presumably, its announcement of Hulu plans. I think the stock will keep trading sideways until then, but there are a lot of people like me, on the sidelines, who will buy into it, if and when its streaming services appear poised to fulfill their potential.Disney still has the best potential in streaming, because it has the best content. No one is going to change that, so Disney needs to take its time and do things right. Rushing a half-assed product won't help anyone, but Netflix isn't going to catch up to Disney's content and brand library any time soon, so time isn't really of the essence.I love the idea of Hulu cross-over shows, and completely agree with the idea of not cannibalizing themselves too hard. I don't mind the commercial vs commercial free option, though. It is a pretty simple option that people understand. Paywalls for content, however, are a different story. I think the Netflix, access to everything for once price model, is the established standard that everyone should meet. If someone wants to get a discount on the service for watching commercials, I don't have an issue with that, but the commercial free version should be truly commercial free, and all content should be available to everyone.One note: remember that Hulu is still only in the U.S. and Japan, while Netflix is basically everywhere. I think this is a big limiting factor that needs to be addressed. This limiting of the company's scope also limits its ability to acquire enough users to make original content a profitable venture. There are only so many subscribers you can get in the U.S. and Japan, and those two countries don't even speak the same language. I live in Canada, and it is rather ridiculous to me that I can't get Hulu here. What about the UK, Ireland, Australia, or New Zealand? It seems like such low-hanging fruit to at least get the service into other English speaking countries.",
"If they could just make Hulu work efficiently like Netflix does, they would have more customers. I can stream Netflix and Amazon without any issue, but even loading the Hulu app on my iPad or TV (via Roku) is a buffering nightmare.",
The parks is where they can easily can subs on both Hulu and their new streaming service as well as the new ESPN ap.  Every ticket buyer should be given sweet deal to join one of the services. You are talking millions of customer that they have in front of them.  Also they need to redo that Hulu ap. It’s absolutely worthless to navigate thru.  Very frustrating. Just google Hulu new ap,

Breaking news on Praluent  http://reut.rs/2t45GRB,
"From BOA 2/26/18: Inflammation rate remains low in Eylea treated patientsRecently, there have been some reports of increased incidence of non-infectiousintraocular inflammation (IOI) in Eylea treated patients. However, we are not tooconcerned by the reports, given 1) IOI is a well known complication of injectingmedicines into the eye, which is on the label of all anti-VEGF antibodies including Eyleaand Lucentis; 2) the overall reported annual rate of IOI for Eylea in 2017 remained verylow at 0.014%, well within the typical annual rates ranging from 0.003% to 0.043% overthe last 6 years; 3) such level of IOI rates was lower than the 1-2% rates shown in theEylea clinical trials and 1-18% in Lucentis trials across indications; 4) >2.2 million vialsof EYLEA were sold in 2017, higher than in previous years; 5) there were occasionalreports of IOI clusters since the launch of Eylea in 2011 and approximately 70% of thecases involved more than one drug lot, suggesting that the clusters are not due to thedrug itself. In light of the recent reports of IOI cases, REGN proactively investigates the causes buthas found no quality issues. No correlation between the cases in newly-treated andtreatment-experienced patients was identified, either. While continuing theinvestigation, REGN proactively communicated with FDA. The agency agrees withREGN’s monitoring approach and did not request for recalls. In the meantime, REGNregularly updates the physician members of the American Society of Retina Specialists(ASRS) to ensure patient safety. As a courtesy, REGN allows the physicians to return anyunused Eylea for vials from another lot. We do not see any impact to Eylea sales andmaintain our 2018 estimate of $3.8B in US.",
"Very interesting pov Doc :)Recently I had some new thoughts about REGN.At first, i thought: Ok, Eylea is going to have competition after 2020 from NVS's RTH285 and Roche's RG7716. Since Eylea is so important, it's perfectly reasonable that market fears about the future competition .Then i thought: wait a minute, it's actually not ""perfectly reasonable"" at all. RTH285 had proven to be none-inferior to Eylea. In the primary endpont: visual gain. Eylea was actually numerically higher than RTH285 although not statistically significant (otherwise it's a failed study lol). RG7716 had beaten Lucentis, but Eylea also beat Lucentis. Last year REGN tested Eylea+ang2 vs Eylea alone and failed. So RG7716 is probably another none-inferior drug.  Eylea has been on market for 6 years already with multiple indications and excellent long term follow up data. Will 2 none-inferior drugs take big share out of Eylea?Let's take another angle:  ABBV's first in class BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib was approved in 2014. Recently AZN's Acalabrutinib got approved too with better efficacy and safety data. e.g. in 2nd line CLL Ibrutinib has ORR 83%, CR 2%. Acalabrutinib has ORR 95%, CR 10%. In 2nd line MCL Ibrutinib  has ORR 68%, CR 21%. Acalabrutinib has ORR 81%, CR 40%. So it's pretty obvious that Acalabrutinib is a me-better drug or even best in class BTK drug. Even Phase3 BGNE's BTK inhibitor BGB3111 is probably better than Ibrutinib in both efficacy and safety. In early proof of concept data, 2nd FL BGB3111 has ORR 41%, CR 18% while Ibrutinib has ORR 21%, CR 11%. Although it's a small study for BGB3111, but at least it's a potential me-better drug.  Ok here is the problem: market never cares about all the competitions for Ibrutinib even competitors are all superior drugs. Market think Ibrutinib will continue totally dominate BTK space with majority market shares. They estimate Ibrutinib will reach 8B sales and superior  drug Acalabrutinib can only achieve 2B sales. Why? Because everyone is so confident in ABBV's commercial ability. Just look at the Humira with all the competitions, it continually beat drug sales historical high record ! Let's say Eylea is ABBV's drug. Will the market fear about 2 none-inferior drugs that are 7~8 years late with only 1 indication so far? I don't think so. Market will assume ABBV will crash them.After this thinking process, it's pretty clear now. It's all about commercial ability. Market thinks REGN is so bad at selling good products. I think it's too pessimistic. Recently REGN hired new head of commercial. She had a impressive CV. I hope she is the right person and step up the commercialization.Long REGN :)",
"Thanks Doc,REGN debt is almost none.I try to buy in sometime.",
"I don't trust many of the writings posted on many media websites as I believe they all have agendas trying to influence the stock price, unless they discloses their positions. REGN trending down after a good ER is a head scratcher.  But there is a divergent between the daily stock price and its RSI.  Barring markets downturn and any negative reports, REGN should hold at this range, if it pokes through $300, we might see $280.  At which time I might load up if REGN fundamentals have not changed.",
Thank you DrX for this article because I also saw the news and was wondering what was going on.  Interestingly it coincided with a bear attack on OMER by FourWorld Capital Management which also seems to be lacking in substance.  But surely not Bloomberg? Have SA and Fierce Biotech become conduits for fake news?,
"I hope I don't appreciate the note only because I concur, but thanks.  I saw that Bloomberg headline and was quite perturbed, only to more so but for a different reason after reading the article.If there is journalistic malpractice that came close.Strongly agree with your comment on interest rates.  REGN's lack of debt and strong cash position us not fully appreciated I believe in the current interest rate look ahead.",
"Thanks for the article on this DrX, as REGN is my 2nd largest position and I try to know what's going on to move it. I read these reports too, but it was strange that REGN was almost unchanged by these reports - telling me that either smart money knew of these (badly reported cases) prior and started selling. As they saw that there's no follow up selling in the market, it might've played itself out. I've also accumulated as much as I wanted to (wanted to save a bit for later, in case Praluent data isn't good, but lower prices pushed me to stock up anyway). Although Praluent news 'might' not be great, I don't think that should be the driver of valuation anyway and will like to add more if there's a sharp dip - just to hope though that it will recover. I don't think company's mgmt can do anything here - they clarified competition issue clearly on concall and there's nothing more to say (unless there is and I don't know of). Thanks.",
"Not clear from reading the article why 315/share is cheap for REGN. But sold puts with 240/share strike price expiring on Jan 2019, for 12.3/share premium.",
"I mentioned this to doc a few weeks ago. On last earnings call, management noted investing & getting approval to manufacture Praluent in Irish facility.  ""We are pleased to report that in December 2017, our facility in Limerick underwent a successful FDA preapproval inspection, resulting in a license to manufacture Praluent for the U.S. market.""Sounded optimistic for Praluent's future, because without very good outcomes data or massive price reduction, hard to see sales significantly increasing in this payor environment.",
"Great and most timely article, and it helps assure REGN loyalists to stay the course, after the hugely depressing news yesterday. For some, it is personal, as Eylea was almost a panacea to those who worry that with age comes, sooner or later, AMD.But your article made me wonder if one should feel the waters are a little less treacherous to dip into small slivers of BIIB, AMGN, AZN and SHPG. I've no scientific data to prove it, but it seems the FDA seems to be approving more British pharma company drugs than other European countries' drugs, such as those from Switzerland, Germany and even Denmark?",
"Doc, I do have a question though. What do you think how wild market will react to the ODYSSEY research? At the time, Praluent should have very low expectation. I personally don't think it will be a big event.",
"Doc, thanks for covering the recent negative news. I literally feel REGN is at or near a technical bottom right now. Lots if selling pressure recently came from Sanofi's selling, which is mentioned in the earnings PR this month.$315 so far has been a strong support for the stock. Sanofi probably stops selling after the stock reaches $315.",

All the longs will make money on REGN. It a matter of when, not if. Hold steady.",

"Doc -- Good commentary.  Larger cap biotechs have lagged.  I suspect it is because the action favors smaller cap biotechs that will be acquisition targets for larger firms deploying repatriated cash, but that's just a guess.  There are certainly plenty of good values.  I'm hanging onto IBB and my individual large cap names.As for REGN, I agree the negative publicity is odd and probably not a good reason for the stock to sell off.  After selling REGN at $520 last July, I started re-building a position at $365.  Now the question is whether to buy more.  It looks like a solid value.I'm entering a limit order a few points down from here.  I suspect the bottom is not in.  --TBC",

As I mentioned before, I bought REGN at 320 and decided not to sell (although I was tempted with such continuous drop in the price). Strangely, I hope more bad news of the questionable type of Bloomberg and MarketWatch reporting come out to shake the remaining weak hands and spare us of a prolonged period of ups and downs with no meaningful direction for the stock.",

We'll just take a factually correct story and word it in such a way to get past editor standards, push it into the pipeline and wait for the rush sellers to scope up the bounty. This stuff happens.

"DoctoRx,Thanks for sharing your insights. I would not spend meaningful time analyzing the Canaccord analyst's research mentioned above. He is not known for quality work (in fact, quite the contrary). Therefore, MarketWatch was nothing more than a conduit to hollow analytical insight.Regards,JC",

Certainly it is better to pay 318 for Regeneron than 605.And the 5 year expected PEG ratio of Regeneron is not bad.",
Dr. Rx:I truly appreciate your insights into REGN. Been in and out of the stock since the 1980s when my father-in-law bought each of his 7 children 100 shares at $10 per share.

"During this turbulent market I am surprised people are not piling into Rockwell Collins stock (COL). Public information of the UTC buyout terms provides a collaring algorithm that as long as UTC stock (UTX) does not go below $107.01 at the date of acquisition closure (i.e. estimated at 2-3 months from now), then each COL shareholder will receive $140 for each share owned.UTX is currently at $124 and is not likely to dip below $107.01 in the near future. COL is currently at $135.  With the published algorithm, that equates a $5 per share increase from now. That is 3.7% gain in 2-3 months.  That is a great investment.Note that if UTX goes above $124.37 (collar upper limit) then COL shareholders get MORE than $140/share. If UTX goes below $107.01 (collar lower limit) then COL shareholders get LESS than $140/share.Understanding that there are NO guarantees of stock performance, but the UTC buyout terms ARE guaranteed (unless deal fails), is everyone investing in COL shares now? Or do you think the deal is going to collapse?",

UTX is very aggressive in these kind of situations. Otis and Carrier are excellent nearly recession proof businesses and are world wide leaders in their respective fields. I would see a spinoff as being most beneficial to unlocking value of these great businesses to shareholders. I am long UTX and will remain so.,
I can't wait to get my shares in UTX.  Long COL.,
Do you think UTX would maintain their dividend if the split up to occur? Does COl combined dividend make this possible? The dividend is my most important consideration!,
"I don't know all of the capital markets considerations, but it strikes me distributing shares of Otis and CCS to existing UTX shareowners via a spinoff would make more sense than IPOing these firms (tax-free, avoids underwriting fees).   UTX doesn't need cash to finance the ROC deal, it can simply load some of its debt onto Otis and CCS.  This would require issuing new debt and retiring existing debt, which would carry some cost, but it's certainly do-able.  Otis, in particular, is a very strong cash generator and therefore can support higher leverage relative to it's size than UTC as a whole.  Another option would be to separate Fire & Security from Carrier and sell it to a strategic buyer to generate cash.  Although UTC once touted the synergies between Carrier and Fire & Security, they are really separate businesses with distinct customer bases who purchase at different times in the construction/ownership cycle.   However UTC accomplishes this breakup, shareowners should benefit.  There is nothing these companies can do as part of UTX that they can't do better as independent companies.",Dis-United Technologies?
"Hey guys- thanks for being interested! Unfortunately, and regretfully, I did not ask about the related party transactions. Secondly, the CFO made it seem that the Chinese cash repatriation item seemed to be more of a timing issue and that it should be stated as ""not if, but when they will receive the capital from China"". In reconciling, two quarters ago, the company had strong international sales which led to the build up i capital. Outside of these two items, he did not divulge much value-additive information that could not be discerned from the earnings call. But leaving the conversation, I believe that management is quite incompetent in regards to capital allocation, especially putting too much emphasis on the Chinese cash, which apparently partially led to the decision to decrease the dividend. Between those two items and exorbitant spending on the new headquarters and a few others things (i.e., potentiality of have the new CEO's options priced much lower) has led me to believe that they will continue to destroy shareholder value, especially once they significantly grow their cash balance.

"Hi, Trump. First, I don't want to pass myself off as some sort of bond expert; I'm not. However, looking at RIG's 7.450 %, maturing 04/15/2027, cusip 893817AA4; Moody's Caa1, SP B; last traded ~94, bottomed 3/2015 at ~46. Again, using this bond as a proxy (RIG's issued a fair number of bonds over time), I'd note that RIG's bonds, generally, seemed to have bottomed in the same time frame as ESV's (~3/2015); yet, while SP/Moody's have RIG's bonds rated lower than ESV's (and bear in mind, I haven't looked into the particulars of any of these bonds), RIG's bonds, as a group, seem to have trended to par more quickly than ESV's.Why? Well, I dunno. My legacy recollection re ESV was that they were the deepwater firm with the best balance sheet of the group. This may or may not have been/still be true, I'm not sure. Based on ESV's bonds having marginally better ratings from SP/Moody's, I supposed it may be. However, my immediate, unscientific take away would be that the bond market, for whatever reason, may think RIG is marginally better levered to a recovery in the deep water market than ESV. RIG's bond ratings generally seem to be from ~Q3/17, so they might be a little dated. But, as those ratings essentially stink (worse than ESV's), all else equal, while I'd class the general price action in RIG's bonds as encouraging, I'd still consider an investment in RIG as a touch speculative.But that's just me. If any of this is important to you (or anyone else who may be reading), please do your own research. The reason I asked the question above re ESV is that I am curious if the author (whose work I find quite good) ever considers this type of angle, or otherwise has any thoughts.Any bond guys out there who'd like to chime in?  Best of luck to all.",
"Hi, thanks for the article, I appreciate the point of view. Doc, I've enjoyed reading your stuff. I am curious, do you ever take a peek at a particular company's bond issuances when evaluating their equity?""Bonds"" can be complicated to evaluate. But, for my purposes, I like to take a brief look at the prices various bond issuances have traded over time to get a feel for things. For instance, Ensco issued a 5.200 %, maturing 3/15/2025, cusip 29358QAE9; this is a senior unsecured note. It last traded ~83, saw lows in 3/2015 at ~50, and Moody's currently has a B3 on it. Using this particular bond as a proxy of sorts, my take is twofold:1. the bond market is feeling a whole lot better about Ensco now than it did about three years ago, but, 2. it hasn't exactly sounded the 'all clear' just yet. To be clear, I'm not suggesting that any of this means that an investor shouldn't take a position in a name like Ensco. I think you raised a variety of great points above, and, as an investor in RDS, I am familiar with that company's affinity for deep water as a part of their approach to managing their access to and development of oil supply.  To me though, the pricing of Ensco's bonds suggest an equity position should be seen as speculative in nature.Best of luck to all.",
"I tend to disagree with the assessment of RIGs management.  I have listened to the conference calls and management in every conference call voiced caution with some optimism. RIG has fared far better than most of the drillers financially although they get the most criticism. Hindsight is always 20/20. We both know some guessing is involved when time the deflection or inflection of a business. I will say if RIG was as optimistic as you say, they would never have stacked more rigs than any other company early in the game. The early stacking of rigs made a huge difference in their financial picture today. Let's give them some credit.",
"Fluidsdoc,Thanks for your comprehensive article. You make a compelling case for a long position. I would agree with you that, given a long enough timeline, these stocks have a good chance of paying off. However, for me in this current environment they are simply trading stocks but I'll be watching closely for a shift in market sentiment. As an aside, RIG shares have been ""hard to borrow"" for the last three trading days meaning the shorts have piled in looking for another leg down. So far, they've been wrong.I listened to the conference call and if I had to sum it up in one word it would be ""hopeful."" However, to quote a line from the movie about Transocean's Deepwater Horizon, ""Hope isn't much of a strategy."" Good Luck and please keep the articles coming!",
I find your article most interesting.  I am long Noble at 5.59.  Thinking about averaging down but also am interested in CHK or ENSCO.  Mixed feelings.  I also believe that SDRL will be a huge opportunity this fall. (?),
"Also in RIG's case, I want to see them get their $3 billion bank LOC renewed.  It is due to expire in late spring 2019.  Management has been playing defense (can't fault them for that) while talking optimistically for 12-18 months now.  Issued higher coupon bonds to pay off lower coupons to extend maturities, over paying for Songa to buy their backlog and cash flow, selling the jackup business to Borr to get rid of billions in shipyard payment obligations.None of those things are bad - in fact management is positioning the company to be able to survive if the industry is slow to recover - so I give them credit for reducing risk.  However, bottom line is that RIG's management team is ACTING defensively while talking industry recovery!",
"Fluidsdoc,Thank you for a well written and thorough analysis regarding oil prices and their potential positive for the stocks of ESV and RIG.  You may very well be correct that now is the time to buy both companies, as well as NE, DO, and RDC (would not buy the more leveraged or the companies working thru BK or still in process:  SDRL, ORIG, PACD, etc.).I will readily admit that I will be late to the party, and am currently not interested in buying any OSD stock.  My main difference with your analysis is the following:1)  The cost of an OSD well is now low enough to encourage the E&P's to increase drilling.  The main reason the costs have been reduced is the day rate the operators are paying the OSD's is a fraction of what they were 3-4 years ago.  What if day rates rise as you predict?  Then one could readily argue that the resulting higher costs of said wells will curtail activity.  We COULD BE in a catch 22 situation, where the only reason operators drill is because day rates are so low.2)  Higher demand is one side of the supply / demand equation.  On the supply side, other than HE rigs in the North Sea, the UDW market is very oversupplied.  There are simply just too many 5th & 6th gen floaters to put back to work before day rates can rise to profitable levels.  The sheer number of UDW floaters should produce a much slower rebound in day rates than you and other bulls are predicting.3)  Your quote from RIG's CC:  ""And while we have yet to see a point of inflection in the UDW market, the increase in tendering certainly bodes well for the future.""You emphasized the 2nd part of that sentence, but I would argue that the first part of the sentence is more important.  There is currently no point of inflection in the UDW market, and with companies like RIG begging for, and willing to take BE or slightly positive cash flow day rates, there can be more pain for the OSD's before things improve markedly.4)  You peaked my interest regarding the E&P's you mentioned, so I went and looked at RDS's 4QCC presentation.  On page 9 of that presentation, I found the following of great interest:  Titled ""Capital Investment 2018-20""DW      $5-6 billionShale   $2-3 billionTotal    $25-30 billionAt least $25 billion in share buybacks from 2017-20.In other words, Shell's is estimating that they will spend about 20% of their total CapEx on DW and 8-10% on shale.  Further in that presentation (p. 22), Shell gave their priorities for spending cash flow:1 - Debt reduction2 - Dividends3 - Buybacks and capital investments.Thus from Shell's most recent investor presentation, it appears that they have a relative lower priority for spending cash flow on DW or UDW.Again, I will readily admit that I will miss buying the OSD's at the bottom of their prices (could have already seen them).  However, given that RIG and ESV will both see larger losses this year (as PapaWhisky correctly points out, many legacy, high day rate profitable contracts are rolling off and being replaced by much lower day rates that don't cover total costs), buying them today could be premature.I would also caution you that RIG's management team has been the most optimistic of any of the OSD's as they have been seeing an industry turn for over a year now.  When I see day rates at profitable levels, then I will know it is time to buy.  The stocks may be higher then, but I will have a greater degree of safety, and not run the risk of ""dead money"".Again, a good article on your part!",
Nice article. Back up the truck.,
"My Good Doctor,Not to be rude, but I think you're circulating a couple of stands off bottom.You know that RIG now is dominated by a huge backlog of industry-leading contracts at $400-500k dayrates or better. These contracts start expiring this year and will continue to expire for the next 6-8 yrs. And they will be replaced (IF they are replaced) with breakeven 'keep the rig working' contracts.Against that backdrop we can only see declining earnings for RIG well into the future.

That makes interesting point for both AABA and SFTBY since they own BABA shares directly.,
'Ownership' is vague as far as Ant & Baba are concerned.,
"Great numbers, TPV,  glad to be a BABA shareholder",
"I thought everyone following Baba knows Ant is a big part of it.  I read that the transaction fee through Alipay or Wechat pay is about 0.6%, which is still a lot of money when the transaction amount is so huge and the two dominate the space. I seem to recall that I read somewhere that Jack Ma personally also owns a small piece of Ant.",

"TsachyThank you for discussing Boardwalk.  We share a view that it is undervalued by the market. There are three additional factors that the market is concerned about and need consideration.1. Timing of revenue changes.  I agree that from calendar 2020 onward, EBITDA should be $750MM+.  Yet, obviously that is lower than last couple of years $800MM+ in EBITDA for 2016 and 2017.  A big open question is how much decline to expect in 2018 and 2019 from lower rates as we wait for offset from new projects. There is a possibility of a positive surprise in my opinion as major growth project Coastal Header is largely built and could generate revenues earlier than planned.2. Trend of revenue changes is negative.  The EBITDA growth table from company that you reproduced is a historical thing of beauty.  EBITDA seems poised to trend negative in the upcoming years.  When at what level it will bottom and return to positive growth in EBITDA is very much an open question.3. The appropriate EBITDA multiple is also open for debate.  You used 12x in your analysis.  I think that is reasonable,  GS used something more like 10x to get a price target of $14. Obviously, there are peers with higher multiples than 12x.   I think the lack of clarity on the timing and trend factors I discussed above have pushed the forward multiple below 10x by the market.  Hopefully, the company can provide plans and updates that provide more visibility into likely ranges for revenue and EBITDA over the next couple of important transition years.",

"Hi MattThanks for your excellent monthly wrap on Cobalt. Much attention is focused on the DRC and its patrimonial centered mining policies. With the Chinese walking every clearing, this leaves investors like myself looking for sustainable and shovel ready Co projects-which you have supplied- This is invaluable. However, I am not as cogient as you on the sustainability of the current Co prices.. While Inventories have fallen recently, teh pipeline can fill quickly if producers sense an opportunity to do so. No matter how we slice it, Co is still a commodity and greed will always become overwhelmed by fear at the first signal of price weakness. Yes, another spike could happen later this year, but its intensity will be watched closely.. I think the first signs of a crack in bubble will cause a rapid collapse of co prices retracing maybe as much as 50% of the latest move. But, there is no reason to stand on the R/R .tracks with hand extended to stop the train at this point..anyway, cheers from MiamiKeep up the good work, J",

I think Germany as well as Australia are closer than we think. They are chomping at the bit as many others looking at tax dollars. As far as police looking the other way. Once legalization comes in I think you may see some crack down and more restriction to steer all but the hard core STONERS to legal weed. Actually I have been few places abroad where there is a great tolerance for weed but I think that will be channeled.,
Here is a good article from DW (Deutsche Welle) explaining German laws:http://bit.ly/2F3YARyAlthough medical consumption has been legal since 2017 it still remains illegal nationally for recreational use.

Follow the money...why did Constellation pick Canopy over the others?  Cannabis will take market share from alcohol...via THC beverages.  Having a large alcohol partner will prove critical in establishing this drinkable brand beachhead...distribution is critical in alcohol for mass market sales...Canopy and Constellation are ahead of the curve,
"A lot of important points, a couple of other considerations,  in growing inventory, it could be a catch 22 situation. With no date for legalization nailed down, cannabis flowers are like a fruit, they continue to mature (ripen) even after harvest.  The Thc(a) converts to thc and then as it ripens it converts to CBN just sitting on the shelf, thus changing the cannabinoid profile of the product.  Educated consumers understand this and do want freshly cured bud.  It is the opposite of alcohol it degrades with time, so inventories devalue over time.  Secondly, as a grower, even when working with clones.  It typically takes 10-12 weeks to get clones ready for flowering and then 8-10 (indica) 10-12 (sativa) weeks of flowering and then 2 weeks for drying and proper curing.  Minimum production time cloning 140 days no less.  Cheers",

"Blame it on Osama bin Laden and 9/11.  The major headwind for all Canadian oil producers is the fact that three US presidential administrations have pushed hard for US domestic oil self-sufficiency on the overall pretense to wean the United States from foreign oil imports especially from Saudi Arabia (from which 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers and Osama bin Laden came, and from where it's believed most of the financing for the attacks came).  With technological innovations like fracking and horizontal drilling the US is now able to exploit it's own domestic hydrocarbon resources that were previously out of reach.  Thus we are at a point where Canadian oil is not only not needed by the United States, but not even wanted since it competes with US domestic producers and WCS discount is a reflection of that undesirability.  Canadian's own stupidity to cancel ""Energy East"" pipeline to ship prarie oil to it's own eastern markets combined with cancellation of the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline which would have allowed exporting to Pacific markets for much closer to Brent oil prices means that Canada's energy sector has a fundamentally dim outlook for the next several decades vastly different from the previous several decades of prosperity driven by export to US markets.

I would like to tell Apple what to do with the money as much as I would like to tell my Hot dog guy how to make 'em sausages,
Rather than worry about the politics of money. Apple should shift its offshore company headquarters to a small country that does not have taxes and issue 10% of that companies stock and make a separate private entity in which Apple owns 90% shares. Essentially making its foreign companies a foreign partner or majority owned subsidiary.

"I grew up in the days of three commercial TV network channels plus PBS. If you wanted media options you read the newspaper or listened to the radio. Along comes cable and its two appealing qualities are choice and ...wait for it...no commercials! Cable growth exploded as consumers happily parted with their money for the joy to be experienced in commercial free nirvana. Cable companies of course got greedy and helped to launch the cord cutter movement. Now we have come full circle and we are of course willing to get free content if we will bear the burden of watching tailored for ROKU user commercials once again. Perhaps the next big product is an AI box that figures out what you want to watch before you do, downloads it and strips out commercials for you.",

Does anyone care about the lockup expiry?,
The problem with comparing the sub counts is that many homes have cable and ROKU and in those homes ROKU is usually secondary.  And Amazon and Google are not going to cede the software market to Roku so easily - although ROKU is dominating them right now.,
"So why did the stock go down 10 points on Thursday if it is such a hot stock.   This stock my go the way many other IPOs, fitbit and gorpo. Look at the valuations and potential, but when a stock sinks 10 points in one day, it's not good.",
"At the current pace, how long until Roku overcomes the losses and becomes income positive?Also, if Roku dreams of becoming the Microsoft and Apple platform of TV streaming, and intends to profit on software through advertising revenue, then why have I never seen an ad on Windows or iOS? I haven't. I question how viable ads are on such a fundamental platfromStill very interested in the stock if the lockup period drives stock down further",

Roku has the best GUI and first mover advantage. And I’m not buying disc movies anymore either - everything streaming, I think they’ll be just fine.",
"Well my smart tv was actually only $120 (small size for smal appartment). When larger, more family sized tvs become more afforadable a few years from now do you think that ROKU will be able to maintain its edge?",

Long term bull on ROKU but think they've got a rocky road ahead in the next couple of months. Particularly w/ the employee lockup expiration on 3/27. Lots of longtime employees will finally have liquidity on their holdings that have performed remarkably well in the past couple of months. Buy the dip!,
Excellent article. I own about 46K of Roku and have been adding. Management did a less than perfect CC which gives me a buying opportunity.,
"Why would I buy a ROKU device if my TV has built in to it internet access that already makes available to me amazon, hulu, netflix, and more? Won't new TV purchasers be thinking the same way and limiting the growth of ROKU?",

"Bought the IPO and sold for a profit.  Just bought back in on the drop.  I have 2 Roku devises hooked up to my Televisions.  Roku just added Xfinity to their streaming line up.  You do need a Comcast Xfinity account, which I have.  But it works great if you have a televison in a room that is not cable accessable.  I kind of have the crazy idea that Comcast will buy Roku.

"Nice, basic article on this ""blue chip"" biotech.  This feels like a transition period in which AMGN holds its sales about steady and increases earnings high single/low double digits through its use of its cash pile (buybacks and m&a) and drug price increases.  Longer term, the argument for owning this is that the company will both be more consistent in getting its drugs approved and that it can throw in a few homers with the bevy of single and doubles it has been hitting.  I note that while, from a more technical perspective, AMGN did have a good pop about 4-5 years ago, it has generally been slower moving to the upside but with less downside than its large cap biotech peers (GILD, CELG, BIIB and REGN), which, along with its solidly increasing dividend and relatively diversified product stream (at least when compared to ABBV, CELG, REGN, etc.), actually may make this stock appropriate for moderately conservative accounts.Long, in order of size, GILD, CELG, AMGN  and BIIB",

"Thanks Michael, that is partially reassuring. ENB's plan is likely to get bogged down in litigation. One way to mitigate the risk of the GP screwing the MLP using the ENB playbook is to see what percentage of the MLP is owned by the GP. The lower the GP holding the lower the risk because they would need a majority vote to acquire all MLP units. Of course there could be other ways the GP could disadvantage the MLP. If the MLP space wants continued acceptability by the investment community safeguards will have to be established either explicitly in the offering documents or by public pronouncements.",
"Michael I just read your article on Enbridge's slap to MLP holders, is that likely to happen at CAPL?",
"CAPL still has to deal with the IDR to the GP, if they want to ever start growing their distribution again. Most likely resolution of the IDR issue will lead to another distribution cut. Even after the cut, their coverage is around 120%, which is reasonable , but not great given their current leverage levels. It’s enough fund some small investment here and there, but unlikely enough to really move the needle. Given that, I see an equity with a static distribution, but a growing obsolescence risk. Not my cup of team, but value is in the eye if the beholder.",

"CAPL too complicated and too low margin. And teh Northeast is not where you want to be. I own a lot of ANCUF. You notice that ANCUF avoids New england states if they can. They try to avoid Calif too. CAPL is heavy in northeast. I would prefer to see ANCUF SEL all it's GP and LP stakes in CAPL. A very logical buyer is SUNOCO! A few weeks ago, SUN  got okay to sell it's C Stores to 7-11 for $3.3 BILLION. So SUN is in decent financial shape. They agreed to supply the Sunococ stores with gas for 15 years. Sunoco is heavy in northeast, as is CAPL. ANCUF shoudl sell it's CAPL interest to SUN. It is a MUCh better for for SUN now. ANCUF can use proceeds to do what they do best. Buy stores, build stpres, pay dpown debt and repeat. CAPL is a drag. Why shoudl ANCUF do drop downs of their less desireable units to CAPL? That stics loser stores to CAPL side! WHY DO THAT! ANCUF should sell lesser stores and use proceeeds to pay down debt.I've always thought that ANCUF is a perfect fit for AMAZON to buyout. NOT BECAUSE OF STUPID GAS which dopes worry about with electric cars (amcuf will just add charging stations and they SHOP WHILE WAIT!)....it is ANCUF's 15,000 small """""""""" brick and mortar"""""""""" store fronts and LAND THAT CAN NEVER BE REPLACED, that amazon will want. Amazon has 65 MILLIOn americans on Amazon prime. if Amazon has a C Store near them , they will use it! And amazon can expand greatly into  groceries in the C Stores. Look what AMZN paid for 135 Whole Foods goocercy stores! 135 of them? TRY ANCUF with 15,000 WPRLDWIDE STORES all conviently located to 65 MILLION AMZN Prime members! GAS WILL BE COME SECONDARY!",

Has CAPL generated much UBIT in the past ? And do you foresee any UBIT generation in the future? It seems they avoided it with the retail franchise segment breakout previously.The graph showing gasoline consumption dropping in the mid 20's is for the U.S. only?

"Great article Dane--spot on.   This is my largest holding @ 40% of my marketable securities.   I have invested a great deal of time studying 10Q's, conference calls, and their web site.   A couple of points:1) This is a new company incorporated in late 2014---therefore the market cap is still quite small and shares are illiquid.  If your horizon is short-term, this stock is not for you.2) The recent pullback has been painful, however I have taken the opportunity to increase my holdings.  3) The business model is unique---very difficult to find a comparable that truly fits.  BT wrote a recent article 2/5 on BXMT.   One of his graphs compares m-REITS and included JCAP which by comparison looked horrible which was unfortunate.   I take issue with the comparison because CEO Dean Jernigan many months ago has very clearly laid out a roadmap or vision anticipating a transition to to a more traditional e-REIT.  That transition has now begun with the recent purchase of three facilities in Georgia and Florida. 4) At this point, JCAP is still primarily a development company therefore anticipate earnings will be ""lumpy""---this is a stock for investors vs. traders.5) I am not anticipating increased dividends or special dividends.   I prefer the company retains it's cash and re-invests back in the business that is IF the opportunities exist for a good ROI.6) I feel management has a keen sense of the cost of capital and their capital funding is designed allowing for flexibility such that they have many funding options depending on market conditions at the time funding is needed.   7) At the current price, you are getting a company for less than it's IPO--there is very little by way of hard-to-value intangibles on the balance sheet.   In addition, you are getting executives many of whom have been in this business all their lives.   I believe this is Dean Jernigan's 3rd start-up in the self storage business.",

On trading sand, it's not an easy stock to trade unless someone wants to scalp for day trading as a profession.  I'm comfortable as holding for long term as long as it doesn't breach $4.20",
"FT,Sandstorm only bought back a little over 2.3% of its shares.  Once new streams come later this year, they could purchase more shares than last year thus reducing more share dilution.",
markets really spooked today.  someone mentioned that tarriffs is bullish for the dollar but I think it's a hawkish stance by the Feds.  The Feds are in a bad position and may have to bow to the sword.  I expect the plunge protection team to step up along with the falling USD.   It still may not be enough.,
"something must be brewing, all the gold stocks are down today with the exception of sand 😂",
"For those interested, the Entree Resources (operations in Mongolia ) results are out - SAND owns about a sizeable 14% of it. The press release might be interesting for those who are not familiar with EGI and its prospects. Unfortunately  I can't provide the link from this device being used.",
"OAG,nice write-up as always.  If gold falls below 1265 it will break the long term rising channel going back to 2000-01.  A lot of times it can shoot to the underside to revert to the mean.  The debt borrowing has gone up a lot more than in 2008 so that should  be minimal to gold declines.  I'll never know if I'm too early in the game.  It's fun to watch.",
$4.58 bottom is looking solid.  So much for Trump's tax tarriffs that is most likely turned down by members of the GOP.,
I would imagine the USD index needs to fall or else historic crashes around the globe.,
"Another one that seems to be off the radar for SAND, http://tinyurl.com/y6w...",
I just saw this:  http://bit.ly/2F5sYLw...Approximately C$25 million has been previously spent exploring the Santa Cruz Properties.  How much is SAND getting from this?  It would seem like New Dimension ended up with a better deal but I don't have all the facts.  If the other two properties are large then SAND benefits over long term.,
"So where is the gold price heading mid to longer term?  No one would know for sure.  If your crystal ball has GLD heading to <$110; perhaps even much lower, and also GDXJ <$25 or possibly much lower, you would probably want to wait for an entry point in SAND in or around the $4 sp range.  If however, GLD and GDXJ are currently at or near the bottom of a longer term trend of recovery and possibly a breakout, SAND could be a buy or strong buy at present.When we look back 6-12 months from now or into 2019 when Cerro Moro begins full production, we will see SAND continue to outperform GDXJ, and likely slightly or more outperform GLD.  But again, if GLD moves to <$110 is stays below that level for any period of time, you can wait on SAND and catch a better entry point ahead of its ascent.IF the GDXJ has a strong rebound (which is overdue), you will see SAND do quite well, and imo it will outpace the streaming/royalty sector, but during a strong mining bull, there will be some quality miners, especially the best of the JR mining companies, that will outperform the streaming & royalty sector during the initial breakout of the GDXJ until it levels out and reaches near the peak of the bull.  It will be at that time that the S&R companies, led by SAND, will takeover with the highest performance at peak and the back end of a GDXJ rally.Again the question is, are we near an overdue breakout rally for the GDXJ/GDX?  I'm not convinced we are yet, but those that miss the beginning of a rally or wait for confirmation will likely miss a significant portion of the rally as they pile into a winning trend.",
"Silly me,   I thought  SAND announced a strategy to sell down some or all of the Hot Maiden mine interest for some kind of royalty interest?10 months later and there is no deal.",
"Let's compare performance of SAND, to both the GDXJ index of SAND and its peers, AND GLD, the paper pseudo for physical gold.  There are a few interesting points to make from this.Using Feb 22, 2017-18; here are the comparisons:GLD  $118.76  -  $126.30  -  +6.4%GDXJ $41.55  -  $31.54  -  -24.1%SAND $4.65  -  $4.63  -  -.004%This particular date on a year-to-year comparison is very unfavorable for both the GDXJ & SAND, compared to GLD.  However, a few things of note is that streaming and royalty companies, like SAND, will hold value much better than the index of mining stocks in a flat or undervalued pm market.  This should be a longer term bullish indicator to the pm mining companies as they are signalling for higher gold and silver prices necessary to attract capital to the sector in order to add exploration and new discoveries to prevent significant physical shortages a few years down the line as the timeline of discovery to production takes several years.  This recent bear pm market has created a reduction in longer term production which will likely result in supply shortages over a longer period creating longer term bullish pressure on the pms.So let's look at how SAND has done since the low on 5/4/17 thru 2/22/18 of both SAND & GDXJ.GLD  $116.63 - +8.3%GDXJ $29.33 - +7.5%SAND $3.18 - +45.6%So from this low of SAND & the GDXJ, we see a dramatic improvement with SAND of the other two by comparison.  I look at the SAND chart since 5/4/17 compared to GDXJ, shows SAND doing quite well despite a lagging GDXJ, thus well outperforming the index.But, there continue to be the critics stating that SAND caused its price share low last year through dilution and a transaction that investors openly rejected, hence the price drop to $3.18.  Please examine the facts a little closer on this.  SAND, and a few other stocks within the GDXJ, were hit with a double-whammy in late April, 2017.  If you are skeptical of this as it relates to SAND, PLEASE, PLEASE, do the research, the facts are there to set the record straight. http://bit.ly/2EYb11hSo here is the double whammy that impacted SAND and a few other stocks included in the GDXJ.  As the attachment indicates, the GDXJ announced a re-balancing of its fund, which as a result, SAND, and others were going to have a number of shares sold off from the fund.  For SAND, this meant millions of shares dumped from SAND during the re-balance.  Please note the dates and timeline.  This is important.  The double-whammy is that during the rebalance, GDXJ was also in a fairly sharp decline reacting to gold volatility and a fairly sharp drop during this brief period by GDX & GDXJ.  This decline started during the GDXJ share selloff which began on 4/24/17.  You will notice sharp declines in SAND on which started on 4/24/17,  It dropped sharply on 4/24; 4/25; & 4/26.  It was AFTER (3) days of the selloff that the SAND/Mariana deal was announced.  The takeaway is, that this transaction which involved 19% dilution, and over 100% increase in production to SAND, did NOT trigger the late April, 2017 decline with this stock.  Further, it is reasonable to assume, that as a result of the GDXJ selloff starting on 4/24/17, that sell stops were triggered by other hedge funds, institutional funds, and larger investors, providing for more selling and lower prices over the 2-week period of decline.  Further, if the Mariana deal/dilution deal was rejected by the market, we would have seen possibly further decline in SAND shares, AND, certainly SAND under performing the GDXJ since 4/27/17; the first trading day AFTER the SAND/Mariana announcement.  We experienced quite the opposite. So here is how the (3) performed since the Mariana announcement through 2/22/18.GLD +4.5%GDXJ -2.2%SAND +27.2%Opinions may vary, but there are one set of facts on this.  A fair conclusion is that SAND returned value to the company and shareholders by diluting 19% to more than double its production by 2022 and many years beyond.  Don't forget the tremendous upside potential on the Hot Maden deal which will very likely add a lot more reserves due to SAND, with minimal cost at a huge discount to SAND on this anchor asset.",
Dividends is not going to happen until HM is bringing in revenue in 2021.  Buying back shares is a prudent step unless they find new revenue streams.  If they ever have to dilute more shares then they will have to press their case like it would grow the company's bottom line and probably bring immediate revenue to bottom line.,
Excellent analysis.  Spot on!,
"As a shareholder, I prefer Nolan continue investing in new streams/royalties rather than paying a token dividend or buying back stock (unless the share price drops below $4).",
"There has been a clear change in tone from management, which this author has completely ignored. He also critiqued q4 revenue without mentioning that it included a one time adjustment...",
"There would be a lot of complaining if Sandstorm had not made deals since 2011. That they were made with all the resources that Sandstorm had available does not bother me. Nolan hates building up debts, and if he does, he wants to get rid of it as quickly as possible. With this, Nolan is on the same wavelength as myself. I feel good about that. If gold starts its real climb and the miners make money, the deals will become scarcer. Now is the time to close deals and NW knows that like no other",

I feel bad that the economy gives me loans from the inflation others pay and I try to vote for sensibility but politicians pay for their campaigns with people who like a big share of our efforts.

"Enjoy reading your articles as they present multiple strategies for trading and track results over time so we can see how they do. As I am mostly a long term investor, it has been very educational to learn about those trading strategies, particularly how the charts inform trading decisions.It would be interesting to see a detailed analysis over the years of what factors drove the success or weakness of each strategy as market and economic conditions change. This is probably really hard to do as you would have to distill out the relevant hard data about the companies' performance, the market, and the external economic environment. But it would sure be interesting to see if a detailed analysis of that sort might point to market environments that are more favorable to one strategy vs another. Are there funds that implement your trading strategies via machine learning AIs? Recently bought a little AIEQ just to familiarize myself with the AI driven approach. The machine learning algorithm should identify those factors over time as a natural outcome of how they learn. A lot of quant funds have AI driven trading strategies.

"""They're both ""tollbooth"" type businesses.""and the road too, including insurance, security, and financial services aimed at banks and companiesThe only change vs. last year is V/MA's ability to avoid internal inflation i.e. wage gains and extra hiring. 1 because employees already have a good wage and 2, V/MA depend on fewer employees per revenue vs. most S&P listings. This makes a potential inflation less damaging but it's also priced into the stocks including most other strength's.V/MA is not viewed as a duopoly.

It's not like defense where you can close your eyes and buy the top like Boeing and Lockheed, or in tech where you can just buy Google/Amzn and pretty much ignore the rest because the potential threat to V/MA is on a different magnitude.

"By the time New York and London get the message that Colombia has turned the corner, AVAL will be back up at $13. Got to buy at the first sign of green shoots. Springtime is here.",
Aval does appear over-valued and it is still struggling with the fallout from corruption scandals and corporate insolvencies. I don't understand how you can claim CIB's provisioning is best? They over-provision and then when they can they release the provisions to give earnings a boost. It appears that they are using credit loss provisioning to massage their earnings. Over provisioning also increases economic cost of capital for a bank making it a highly undesirable practice. Perhaps CIB is expecting further NPL growth and significant credit write-offs in coming months? There is little evidence of any major uptick in Colombia's economy. Tourist hot spots because of a weak peso and housing developments targeting foreigners are booming (again weak peso and other attractions) but the real economy remains weak. That will weigh on the performance of Colombia's banks for at least another year. NPLs and credit right-offs typically lag behind the economic cycle so I would expect to see credit quality decline for another quarter at least. The Colombian economy won't improve until oil firms further and the short-term issues surrounding the oil industry are alleviated.,

Because of HBI’s debt I think ROIC is the best metric to measure this company by. Most of their debt is now locked in at a fixed rate. I think that was smart and they have very good cash flow to service that debt. Their excellent ROIC means they are doing a good job with accretive acquisitions. They aren’t overpaying and they are integrating these new operations cost effectively. I am a buyer of these shares. Names brands mean a lot in this industry as they portend repeat purchases over a long time frame. The companies vertical business model enables them to squeeze more margin out of every sale  and improve the profitability of the brands they acquire. This stock has a lot more upside than downside in my mind. It is trading at a very low multiple of expected forward earnings. I like the set up.,

"Nice synopsis Zheng. Posters on other forums are worried about the debt financing based on the CEO's past and management overall. I'm not that worried, as I view it as one of two things--the worst outcome excluded. 1) Finizio and Co. are trying to get the best deal possible and their isn't a particular rush to do so as they stated in the conference call--regardless of getting a credit line or not.2) continual mention of what debt they want to secure--from memory so don't hold me to it. This seemed a bit odd to me. Finizio mentioned a few times--again from memory--that they wanted $200m in debt financing but weren't in a rush. Why? A possible reason is that he wanted to let potential suitors know what it would cost to get 004 and later 001 launched. If they have a few months before 004's decision, then there doesn't seem to be any reason, beside shareholder peace of mind, to lock in a deal now. Give potential suitors info to decide if they want to acquire the company. All told, if this stock drops below $5, I will be considering adding to my position.",

"Fellow Investors:  Be careful! You should know by now that free research reports must be thoroughly researched against other credible sources. A gentleman from the semiconductor industry provided several useful comments in response to Breezy's first article on this chalcogenide technology, explaining that it has and will not have any significant impact moving forward. Free research articles such as this one and those provided on Yahoo Finance seem to be aimed at either driving a stock price up or down quickly. If you track stock performance against the release of these articles, you will see a definite correlation. Don't be one of those who buys a stock thinking it's going to rise rapidly based on these reports only to find that it suddenly and dramatically drops because a subsequent negative report comes out soon thereafter to drive the price back down. You've go to do your research. Check out technical publications like ""Semiconductor Engineering"" if you really want to know what's going on. Most of the people who write these articles don't have the technical background to really assess what's happening in the industry, but they will spout information as if they know, sometimes intentionally exaggerating it. I will give you a recent example. On the day Lam Research reported record Q417 earnings and a positive outlook for 2018, a Morningstar ""analyst"" released an article stating that EUV lithography would cause a dramatic drop in Lam's business in 2018 and beyond. The stock price went into a free fall that day when the opposite should have occurred. The information in the Morningstar article was grossly incorrect. Unfortunately, investors saw it on Yahoo Finance and sold in a panic. Morningstar achieved their desired effect. I'm sure they've enjoyed buying the stock at a nice low price not giving a care to anyone who may have lost money as a result of their manipulation.",

From your last Loihi link in your article (http://intel.ly/2wjsFoN):""What’s next?Spurred by advances in computing and algorithmic innovation, the transformative power of AI is expected to impact society on a spectacular scale. Today, we at Intel are applying our strength in driving Moore’s Law and manufacturing leadership to bring to market a broad range of products — Intel® Xeon® processors, Intel® Nervana™ technology, Intel Movidius™ technology and Intel FPGAs — that address the unique requirements of AI workloads from the edge to the data center and cloud.""Shy though Intel has never been, it's still intriguing to see a phrase like ""...the transformative power of AI is expected to impact society on a spectacular scale."" from any key technology firm.  ""Spectacular"", wow...But it seems fully credible to me.  Integration of significant advances in all AI related niches is, in my view, accelerating the acceleration of AI advancement.  And I suspect Strong AI* will arise much sooner than most foresee as further integration of terrific work leads to more rapid achievements than anticipated.  The singularity (but I prefer simply 'inflection point') is coming.  Nobody can know when.  But in my view after decades of moving the goalposts back we're now conditioned to think the event remains much more distant than it really is.  It might blow into existence seemingly out of nowhere.The Boston Dynamics robots did that in some measure - my sense is that they startled most casual observers.  (http://bit.ly/2sZRJUL)  The next shoe to drop might be a comparably perceived step function advancement in genuine consciousness, such as a public event in which Watson v2.0 is revealed to have advanced to true real time consciousness and self awareness - an ""Oh my god, somebody's in there!"" state.In the end I suspect we'll look back and realize that we overestimated the time to the inflection point not so much because we misjudged the advancement of AI technology, but rather because we misjudged ourselves.  Our egos lie to us like true masters, constantly assuring us that we're very, very magically special - so much so as to be far, far more than simply an artifact of nature, like all other creatures around us, but rather an artifact of real magic - of gods.  And that is of course a tough technology hurdle to jump.  But it's not real - it’s just an arrogant and powerful lie from our egos and nothing more.  We are not magic and we don't set so high a bar.  And that distorting element in our judgement may be blinding us to the pace of a world changing inflection point.  (Especially when combined with a history of anticipating too early and thus now inclined to avoid repeating that misjudgment.)  With implications far beyond investing riches of course.Intel’s use of the word spectacular is credible in my view.  Or perhaps even grossly understated...Just my personal opinion of course, but in my view as Watson, Loihi, Boston Dynamics, Self driving vehicles, and many other AI related technologies increasingly integrate we’ll be genuinely startled by the pace of advancement.  And then something will occur which will strip our egos to a stark naked state, revealing an Olympic class hurdler sprinting toward not a 130 cm hurdle as we thought, but rather a very, very humble 30 cm hurdle.  And hardly even noticing it as it flies past with ease...* http://bit.ly/2jxwnGP.  And, mentioning a terrific and important rabbit hole again, sorry for my duplication:  WaitButWhy.com.

"@author, Stephen, If I condense your articles, this and the prior ones, what you have told us was the following, basically:1-conventional Moore's Law (= ML) scaling is about to hit the proverbial brick wall sooner or later. 2-but when one changes over from Si gate switching to chalcogenide switching, many of the ML limitations no longer apply. Hence chalcogenide-based anything has lots more future potential than Si gate-based anything.3-this change-over does not need to happen overnight; ML has a bit of ""umph"" left for a while longer.4-one way INTC + MU are proceeding to move chalcogenide from a ""semi fabbed"" stage of maturity to real maturity, is by increasing the volume of Optane product (however disappointing performance might be). 5-the product details that everybody here wastes their time on, are more or less immaterial, IMHO. Important is only that IMFT is gaining production experience with chalcogenide. 6-with EMIB Intel has the means for moving over from Si gate switching to chalcogenide switching (= CHS) at a pace under their own control. CHS for memory only at first, with ever increasing performance, eventually cost-competitive also. And eventually turning into a mass-producible product.6a-then CHS storage turning into CH memory again, integrated (via EMIB) into substrates containing memory + processing. For VASTLY improved overall SYSTEM performance.6B-AND THEN eventually CHS being used everywhere, in totally new processor designs!7-possibly eventually integrating everything into a CHS-based SoC, but not necessarily so, as long as (EMIB + several small chips) have higher yield and lower cost than a huge SoC in full CHS. Stephen, do you agree with the scenario I sketched out?One thing this scenario tells me: Owning INTC is the wiser choice in the long run, because they own EMIB and they have processor expertise.

I see a few other votes for die stacking versus QLC.  I will throw my hat in with the skeptics.  The probability that they have jumped from SLC to QLC in a single step when it was apparent that they were using a lot of 'over provisioning' for SLC in the 900P is astounding.   There is definitely a new controller on this M.2 package as it has a lower power state which means it may actually work in portables.  The XPoint die is very large and to fit 118 GB in an M.2 form factor suggests that they are die stacking.  They could not fit 8 packages on that form factor.  I think I would have waited for a tear down before jumping to these conclusions.  I know you want it to be true but it seems highly unlikely.,
This article guesses what is in the box without bothering to look inside the box and the fan boys love it. My guess it is stacked die not QLC. I will wait to see an FA report on the die themselves. Long Intel since 1991.,
"with the level of endurance that xpoint has at slc,, mlc/tlc/qlc/octo-lc makes sense for the product long term, I have a hard time believing that these die are at that density already. since the original package only had a single die, a multi die package is probably the first step which would also multiply the performance and make it look good against traditional nand ssd. while optane drives have low latency, the spec sheet to less sophisticated buyers looks bad at peak R/W speeds compared to nand due to the ssd parallelism right now.",
"However they are doing it that they are should not be a surprise.They are at the very top of a very steep learning curve. Good for IMFT!Breezy, thanks for the illumination.",
"Mr. Breezy:I dunno whether they are doing QLC, or stacking dies, or moving to more layers or finer geometry.  But I do know two sophisticated partners have spent a bundle on the latest spruce up of Lehi.  And they didn't do that because this technology is bad.Can't wait to see any optical interface to all this.  Keep those articles coming.  Nice work.",

"I looked into Ping very briefly a couple of years ago on behalf of a potential buyer. They seemed to be a quality company, mostly focused on B2E (business-to-employee) SSO (single sign-on) and B2B federated SSO. Of course everyone in the identity and access-management (IAM) space is rushing to support hybrid enterprise customers (meaning SSO and other functions for unified management of system in the customer's own data center, as well as conventional application deployed in public Cloud facilities (AWS, Azure) and also real Cloud-native apps. I hadn't heard of the move into CIAM with the UnboundID acquisition.  That's a much more B2C (B-to-customer) space so the basic enterprise buyer's requirement that's being addressed is quite different (and the internal customer within the enterprise buyer is likely not central IT.) What Ping was not planning at the time (as far as I could tell) was a real multi-tenant IAMaaS offering. Nor are other IAM companies doing that, AFAICT, except in the pure Cloud-native environment. It would be challenging to make this work in a hybrid environment since diverse and often proprietary protected resources (conventional applications, databases) would have to be integrated with the IAMaaS service.  But multi-tenant Whatever-aaS is where the scalability is.",What Lies Ahead For Ping Identity?

FCF is 4.5b on EV of 60b. 7.5%  yield. Roche about 6.5%. GILD probably higher. Celg at 5%.

"I bought this last year at $142 thinking it was cheap (it hit $250) and I needed more exposure in the pharm area.  Since then it's been whipped around hitting $160 before falling to its current level.  It looks even cheaper but I'd be happy to get out at a profit now.  I just missed out on buying stocks like ABT at $36 and I feel like I settled a little with this company (i.e. I didn't have a lot of conviction when I first bought it).  My point is, never buy a stock without conviction just to diversify.  Stick with your investment discipline.  Over the past three years there have been a few examples of my doing that and with the exception of RIO, which first cut its dividend before finally rebounding, it hasn't worked out.  Maybe Shire comes back, I hope so.  I just wanted to share some advice from someone who's been investing for a few decades and has had his share of mistakes.",
"I agree that Shire is incredibly undervalued.  I am surprised they have not been taken out by a bigger pharma company.  Shire would be immediately accretive to almost all other large pharma companies out there.PE of 8, debt/ebitda down to 2.9, and a great pipeline.  Don't be surprised if companies like Pfizer or AbbVie start looking at it.",
the share price hardly responds or sustains with good news. and that's not good news.,
"HB,Unfortunately for the Shire longs until data for Hemlibra is brought forth for those with inhibitors the fate of the Hemophilia will weigh on Shire share price. I am surprised no mention of the potential for a split of the company-- in my opinion Shire should meld legacy products (Hemophilia and Neuro) into one spin-off and focus exclusively on rare drugs. The remianco would be very valuable and the spinco not so much outside of a generous dividend.",
I feel another reason for the undervaluation is that investors are not convinced whether the free-cashflow can be materialised. Shire is not paying much dividend and is unlikely to start share buyback before 2020 as it is committed in paying down the debt. Then they might start other acquisitions.,
Well written article and I completely agree. Unfortunately the market is smarter than the two of us Shire longs combined.,

"It would be interesting to know the age distribution of the subscribers and the income distribution of the subscribers, but I doubt Netflix is going to make that public (I haven't looked for that information).  My guess is that demographics is going to matter in that younger age groups will be less loyal subscribers and that income levels will matter in that higher income households will buy more expensive viewing options elsewhere.These businesses that depend on fashion and fad make me nervous in that consumers can turn on a dime for entertainment, clothing, gaming, etc. It is not like a utility that people can't live without.Always enjoy the analyses, reminds me of business school case studies, thanks!",
I have two major disagreements with the article first the author assumes only net additions to subscriber growth I know ask for me I cancel my Netflix subscription for several months out of the Year while I wait for new content to become available secondly at this point does anyone really believe that the rest of those households don't know about Netflix by now if they wanted a Netflix account they would already have one for the most part. not saying no new subscriber growth but to assume that the rest of those 126 million households will come around to Netflix when they haven't come around by this point I think is ridiculous,

Well done!Nice job breaking out the numbers and explaining them.,
Nflx paid verizon n tmobile  to get more free subscription. Stupid investors only pay attention to subscription and neglecting this company is bleeding profusely and cannot sustain. Thats why ha stings keep looking for other idiots to buy them out,
"While continued growth in the U.S. market is assured (the only question being rate and ultimate saturation level) the more important trend from a financial perspective is subscription upgrades. NFLX doesn't really break this out but a key factor in forward operating margins is moving subscribers to higher subscription tiers. This is done in two ways: annual base subscription rate hikes (pricing power, what accounted for a lot of the bump in Q4 as the last of the ""grandfathered"" lower rates expired) as well as moving subscribers to higher service plans. The transition to 4K UHDTV means that millions of people today own 4K TVs that replaced their old HDTVs. And for 2 or 3 dollars more per month you can get full value from that purchase by upgrading to NFLX's 4K streaming plan. And yes, once you've seen shows in 4K DolbyVision you'll never want to go back to plain-old HD.So a U.S. subscriber is more than just a subscriber. They're also a potent source of incremental revenue since the U.S. is a far less price-sensitive market than many International markets. It's also a lot easier (and more profitable) to sell to an existing customer since a good chunk of those extra monthly dollars drop directly to the bottom line.The net is that regardless of absolute numbers, NFLX U.S. subscriber revenue and profits should only increase over time.",
"Very misleading ""facts"" presented here. First of all, the Pay vs. Non-Pay TV chart is from 12/15 and makes no distinction between real numbers and projections. Why are old projections from 2015 used instead of current numbers, and why trust a chart that doesn't distinguish between the two? Second, the author attributes ""operating margins"" to what are actually Netflix self defined ""contribution margins."" In the author's words - ""The U.S. market posted an operating margin of 34.4%. That’s lower than it has been in the last several quarters, but it’s still well above the 30% mark. In contrast, international operating margin came in at 8.7%.""  These are not operating margins, as many operating expenses have to be subtracted from the contribution margins that are listed. Netflix had company wide operating margins of 7.2% in 2017, so obviously that's a huge difference to investors.",
"Nice article ty.   Seems that the spend will need to increase as more competition comes on line and to keep the eyeballs coming, content must be great.  Growth is great but not to the point of validating the high p/e this stock commands.  It is a ws darling but revenues need to come in line with the additional eyeballs otherwise, at the some point, realism sets in with the investor population and the attractiveness dissipates.

Very good break down of the characteristics of  a turnaround stock. more importantly it confirmed much of what I've observed over the years as a invester/trader.,
"Lets make one thing clear....UAA is not Nike.  Many have made a run at Nike and failed.  Remember Reebok?  Nike is one of the best marketers in any industry, one of the best ever.  UAA has hit a wall in the U.S.  Overseas, all growth appears due to new store openings and has low margins.  UAA faces increased competition within its category but also outside from athleisure.  Unlike Skechers, UAA must pay big bucks to endorsers which squeezes margins.  Only Nike has found a way to consistently make that model work.",
Do you think we fill that gap from $14.50ish -$16?,
"I appreciate the article, but UA, no reason to pay a premium for UAA, is not worth $7B at this time. Yes, we all wish we timed it correctly and bought at Nov lows, and you will have another opportunity in the near future. I was a UAA bull for 2015/2016 riding and buying the whole way down, it was very stressful. I dollar cost averages and sprung with minimal loss in the low $20’s, obviously before this spiral. For UA, I’m looking for an entry less than $10, I. The $8’s to be more specific or around $4B-$5B MC, however I think management needs a shakeup and they need to get their swagger back. As many have pointed out, if you can buy goods at TJ Max and Marshall’s, this is NOT a good sign. UA should look to water down the brand, but be more premium like LULU.

"Andrew:  Thanks for the article.  Also just read your bond bear market article.  Very good and relevant to this article as well.  The valuations on this entire group are totally nonsensical.  You would think these over priced sneakers are a cure for cancer.  NKE is the poster child.  While a great company, is it worth 30 times earnings with 5-7 percent growth in a strong economy?  They play the Wall Street game very well.  They low ball expectations, and then beat every quarter.  UAA just pulled this off last quarter as well.  Have you noticed that when earnings are announced, the headlines always compare to expectations and not the prior year quarter. Then there are interest rates.  If rates do keep rising and you can get 200-300 basis points more from a 10 year than NKE's dividend, do you think institutional money will pay a premium for a stock with moderate growth?  And back to interest rates.  I would love to see your TLT chart adjusted for the value of the dollar.  The dollar is falling because the currency has to be discounted to attract foreign money to fund our massive growing deficit.  I have traded UAA from the short side for two years now.  Just set a new short.  The bull case is that it is undervalued to NKE based on sales.  Well, NKE can take sales to the bottom line.  UAA did not even come close to Nike's metrics even in the best of times.  So in my opinion, you have to value UAA on its own fundamentals.  It's kind of like buying KMART because their price to sales was so much lower than Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart was overpriced and went nowhere for a decade and KMART went bankrupt.  Short UAA.  New lows!",

You would think being you’re first article and all that you would get your factual data correct...,
A question to readers. Why would a new contributor write an article that obviously took many days to complete on an obscure startup pharma? The tiny stipend  and pennies per click give no return.Thus why write this? One of two reasons. First is a contributor wants to contribute regularly in the pharma sector. The second is we will not see this contributor again as it is simply a shill for the naked short group that has harassed AMPE for months.Time will tell which is correct.,

"Gosh I hope your long on some calls just in case your completely wrong, like Rlyp shorts were.  Wait nope, hope you get trapped.",
"There are a number of things that are left out or flat out wrong in this article.1. Michael Macaluso did not say that acquisition or partnering news would be released in 30-60 days, as you claim. He said, ""I think, within the next 30 to 60 days, we'll have a very good indication of the direction we are going to take.""  This is in response to a question about a timeline for Ampion being brought to market, and more specifically, in reference to choosing whether to partner with companies that submit the BLA immediately, or with companies that would hold off on the BLA until a later date, such as one that would wait until one of their ""key drugs fell out of patent."" This is not about a deal being completed in 30 to 60 days, but simply the direction of focus for the opportunities presented (such as whether to partner, sell, or license).2. You twice mention 206 patients were in the last trial, AP-003-C. ""Two hundred and six participants with severe OAK were randomized to Ampion or saline at a 6:1 ratio."" and ""The trial was relatively small with n = 206."" I have no clue where you came up with this number. As evidenced in the clinicaltrials.gov database, there was a total enrollment of 168. In the press release detailing the results, they indicate there were 144 Ampion patients. 144:24 is a 6:1 ratio. 144+24 = 168.3. Ampio was presented with 9 options during their first meeting in September, with the ability to come up with an alternative. When they reached out to the Ombudsman, he was able to provide additional guidance in November. They received even more guidance in February, after they met with the FDA in December. Following the receipt of all this guidance, and with the assistance of a former CBER director, they settled on this trial design, based on being referred to OMERACT-OARSI, as Bill pointed out.4. Ampio was represented by Hogan Lovells in their discussions with the FDA. Hogan Lovells is highly reputable, and their services have been retained by many of the largest biotech and pharmaceutical companies, such as Amgen, Merck & Co., and Hoffmann-La Roche. Their reputation brings credibility to the discussions that Ampio had with the FDA.5. Locust Walk, their strategic advisor, is the one that told them to put the BLA submission on hold, based on conversations they have had with companies.6. While you acknowledge Ampio had ""more advanced OAK patients,"" you fail to indicate that the Cingal trial had KL-1 patients. KL-1 is minor in severity. The less severe the disease, the greater the pain reduction. Ampio did not treat KL-1 patients.7. Why nothing about the evidence for a potential ""disease-modifying drug?"" There are companies salivating at the mouth for a disease-modifying drug for osteoarthritis of the knee. For example, Merck KGaA released primary results from a Phase 2 study that showed evidence of disease modification in osteoarthritis of the knee with their drug Sprifermin. It did not show statistical significance compared to placebo in the WOMAC scores. Despite this, they are encouraged by the results and drug.I would guess Merck KGaA would be interested in Ampion, given that the MRI analysis suggests an anti-apoptotic effect and an increase in the cartilage regeneration rate. That, plus Ampion has shown evidence of statistical significance compared to saline for KL-4 patients.Coincidentally, Merck KGaA is located in Germany. Michael Macaluso did state in the December conference call that he would be having his fifth meeting with a European pharmaceutical company, which is one of the largest pain drug manufacturers and distributors in the world. Pain is one of the nine medical treatment areas Merck is focused on.",
"Given the authors analysis regarding the probability of yet another trial, I believe the company would have conducted an equity offering over the past several months given the stock price. Since they have not done so as of yet, it is possible that a partnership or buyout are being discussed.",
"Yet another counterargument is common sense, together with experience.  It was stated on the last CC and at the most recent JPM conference meetings that multiple pharma/biotech partners have had or were willing to have partnering discussions. Some of these were multiple meetings with the same company. As someone who has personal knowledge of how the industry works I can state with certainty that no VP of R&D is going to waste time evaluating a drug that has no chance of approval or commercial success.  It does not guarantee a deal, but they don't waste resources on due diligence of non-starters.I have realistic expectations for this. It won't be a blockbuster deal, but there will be a deal. MM is on the record stating several times the FDA was looking for a means to get Ampion approved.  It does no harm and quite often is beneficial. Averages obscure the wide range of responses to the MOA which is less broad (and yes less potent) than corticosteroids, but also without any of their side effects.  That is part of why the FDA recommended the ORR criteria. Any investor should read the OARSI-OMERACT publication. The criteria was invented by OA physicians INTENTIONALLY TO MITIGATE AVERAGE EFFECTS FROM NON-RESPONDERS.",
"Furthermore, FDA guidance (from same presentation) clearly stated that OMERACT-OARSI Responder Rate was allowable. Something this article failed to mention!!""– FDA provided guidance that Ampion’s pivotal study should include both WOMAC A pain and WOMAC Cfunctional assessments and was referred to OMERACT* – OARSI**""",
"""In fact, Macaluso brazenly admitted he didn’t care (time 50:30) if trial participants were violating protocol by taking opioids because only Ampion patients would be evaluated""LOL gotta laugh about that one. Macaluso is just having fun, spending investors' money. Clearly he doesn't take this seriously.",
"As a long term shareholder, I share many of these concerns. However, regarding the latest trial, the Rodman and Renshaw presentation from Ampio included the following:""FDA acknowledged challenges with an “active control” such as saline and provided clear guidance on a number ofstrategies for consideration in a pivotal trial, including (FDA correspondence Sept 2016):– “Adding endpoints such as mobility or using a composite endpoint”– “Designing a non-inferiority trial instead of a superiority trial”• Ampio proposed a study of severe OAK subjects with 6:1 randomization (Ampion:saline) to preserve blinding and toprevent the bias in pain assessment that may be associated with an unblinded evaluation– Pre-specified, a priori analysis will be based on data from subjects treated with Ampion• Physicians and KOL’s informed the 30% responder rate in the study for a clinically meaningful endpoint""",
"I'd say author is 100% right on this one. FDA has tightened up on meds for OA over the years. Anika tried the 510k route with Cingal... using saline as a sham control. FDa said no, no and no for over a year before Anika caved in and agreed to do a three-way trial. Results in a few months on that, if they had listened they would be selling already. Let's say Ampio was deaf if they though they could get away with this. As for saline, to repeat, it is sham not placebo ... and very effective for a while. The surgeon's argue that HA should not be used because it costs a lot and is little more effective than saline. What they never say is just use a saline rinse! If Ampio is as cheap as saline why not - it might make a non-inferiority claim vs saline! Just!",
"As the saying goes, once a fraud, always a fraud. You are short the stock. You have zero credibility. Your facts aren't even close to the truth. Perhaps before you spew off at the mouth, you should do your homework. Call the FDA Ombudsman assigned to Ampio and ask her if the FDA assisted in the trial design and parameters. You are using their current marketcap as their valuation when scum like you have shorted it and writes hit pieces to push it into a lower position than it should be in.

You didn’t mention the recent 20% increase in the dividend that bucks the trend of 5-10% increases.  This alone should tell you what mgmt and the BoD thinks about the business moving forward.

"""The 8.6% dividend yield (with the stock at $8.40) should give you quite a bit of cushion unless rates really take off."" - This statement is misleading as no one knows what the current dividend yield is as the dividend hasn't been declared yet. From the Q4 earning's transcript, ""Lastly, as previously mentioned, this quarter transitioned from a monthly dividend to a quarterly dividend distribution. We expect our board of directors to declare the dividend by the middle of March and we will issue a press release at that time.""",
"Yes I’d like it more if the payout ratio was lower and anyone who doesn’t already own it would also like it more. If all goes well and all else being equal they still will have a very high payout ratio so the stock price will never do much. so yes the return will be in the dividend with NAV declining while they are returning capital (lowering basis in stock) through a very high dividend not covered by earnings (see 2017 dividend tax classification announcement and note return of capital portion) why do you think they have this? they have chosen to use all of their earnings and currently still need to raise cash either through property sales or stock issuances to sustain the earnings shortfall to simply cover the current dividend level ($3-$5 million/yr). Where else is the additional cash coming from to cover the dividend? Throw in CEO track record, clearly an issue for some, and they are in a tough spot. Need something strategic. Maybe MAA gives them a call. Take a look at BRG - recently internalized, has reset the dividend...different balance sheet and mix of properties/assets but worth a look for a value play.",
"I’m enjoying the back and forth....Well if you’ve owned REITs generally since Jan 1 it hasn’t been a good bet. I do think those apartment REITS that focus on secondary markets with the best balance sheets and  appropriate payout ratios will be fine, not great, in a rising rate environment and yes inflation should help.  My point is simply to be careful with IRT as the majority of the return is likely to come from their current dividend which is not covered as the author suggests and not expected to be in 2018. I like their assets and leverage but don’t like the payout ratio being over 100% in one of the best cycles ever....hard to imagine the cycle getting much better and lasting much longer plus mngt has a terrible track record....time will tell.",
"IRT is in a difficult spot , as i don't see how they can meaningful grow their FFO/share. Their debt metrics are too high , and at least they noted on the cc that they would not increase debt. But  they also said they won't raise equity at the current stock level. They also pay out most , if not all , of their cash flow. So how do they grow? Only way is capital recycling - sell non core properties and swap into core B markets . But that's not going to move the needle.I also have concerns about mgmt. Scott Schaffer was one of the key managers at the train wreck RAS. Why would he do any better at IRT? Did his mgmt skills suddenly improve because he is switching from commercial mtgs to apartments? One of the comments above also talks to IRT not deducting recurring capital expenditures to arrive at FFO. What is that other than an effort to mislead investors? Like to see an explanation for that other than your defection of the issue by talking about MAA.   I haven't been able to locate mgmt comp but did see a comment that need to be looked into, regarding them issuing significant amounts of share to themselves.  Have you looked into this? Your article seems to be pretty light on important details like this.  As for the dividend, it's not safe and i wouldn't be surprised to see a cut when they announce the qtly rate.And again, you addressed this by defecting to talking about how IRT would still yield more than MAA is they paid out 70%. IRT is no MAA.",
"Yes their existing debt is largely fixed/hedged but they have already been impacted by rising rates. Rising rates widen cap rates which decreases the value of their portfolio over time which is Another reason the stock is down (unless NOI growth keeps up). They can’t raise capital, issue equity at these levels, and deploy accretively into new acquisitions for the time being...and the massive payout ratio just adds to the challenge....they are hoping NOI growth keeps up and long term value enhancing capital improvements and inflation lead to higher rental rates....lookout if they use the ATM at current stock price levels....",

"The excess cash is even bigger than the $163bn in net cash everyone is talking about. As a reminder, Apple generates >$50bn per year in free cash flow and yet they pay out <$13bn in dividends annually. Hence, their capital returns (BOTH dividends and buy backs) need to go much higher. I recommend you do the math on a scenario of getting to zero net cash in, say the next three years, INCLUDING the free cash flow generation. The only way to get there are MUCH higher capital returns or a wave of M&A. Also, don't forget they have 8 years to pay the repatriation tax, which is already accrued (no P&L impact), and also back end loaded. Quite frankly, the excess cash is a ""problem"" (less than optimal capital structure).

"More response to Springtogreen comment: a cochlear ear implant requires one or two devices per person. The applicator for the Cell Mist System is not taken home by the patient. It presumably is reusable. As for the number of hospitals in the USA, look it up on the web, something just under 5,900. Add the VA, hospital ships, whatever. This treatment has to be done within a strictly controlled environment. Yes, if all we hear is true, the potential market in terms of hospitals would be Multipules of stateside.",
"I think you are making my point. Using your examples and costs associated, only one-fifth of the cost of a cochlear implant operation relates to the device. There is a large extreme in the estimates of the global burn market from $45 billion as quoted but not substantiated by a stock pump job done by a third party that appears on Yahoo and the estimated $1.67 billion in 2016 and projected to grow to about $2.6 billion in 2025 that appears on the web when you search for the size of the burn market. Applying one-fifth to those numbers results in vastly different market opportunity. I’m not questioning whether the applicator. Is real or if it will eventually receive FDA approval. I’m questioning the size of the end market opportunity and the validity of the market opportunity presented in the Yahoo Finance pump that has received considerable attention.  Until someone documents the market opportunity specifically for this product at $45 billion, it would appear that using your example the potential sales of the cell mist system may not exceed the current stock valuation. Certainly an important contribution to the medical profession and the majority owner who supposedly paid $400,000 to buy the company will do well but minority shareholders  who bought from $3-7/share, not so.",
"Less than 6,000 hospitals in USA, figure 50-100,000 world wide, but many are clinics and how many can afford it. Throw in military at regional hospitals...this can’t be done in the field...and perhaps acne treatment, which could be big. My point being treatment has to be done under highly controlled circumstances. I don’t question the validity of the product, just the potential revenue and when the controlling  shareholder decides to sell, what happens to the proceeds given his history. Take a look at a picture of the cell mist gun, you really think they’ll sell for $50,000? With one employee, who will train hospital doctors and technicians? If the controlling shareholder sells to a medical equipment company what will he receive, $500 million? Great for him but what does that translate into for minority shareholders? At theses stock prices it looks like the floor could drop out. In a year if they get FDA approval the stock will pop but right now it looks like the “greater fool theory.”",

"I agree with most of your points and think it is correct to say BAND is in TWLO's shadow. BAND is not going to grow like TWLO, but there is large, and growing market for CPaas, smaller business and some large ones that TWLO doesn't target, where BAND does well. Furthermore they've commented about expanding internationally. That'd represent a significant growth prospect and that is within reach. I think given the growth prospects relative to the market cap of BAND , relative to TWLO that BAND is undervalued. I could see it staying around 30 for a while.

Good comment!We need more of these commentators! The antigold movement in Greece has a piece on the tailings dam. Use google translate  http://tinyurl.com/ycd...They say that the company has changed the way it handles the tailings which is against the agreement with the Greek government (but its antigold so you never know).P.S. Seeing the pictures of Skouries and Olympias and the significant capex already done one cannot conclude that the Greek mines are worthless no matter what the stupid Syriza party decides.,
"I do not know if you have seen the last presentation of EGO for the BMO conference. In the part related to Skuries I have been struck by two things:1. In the updated technical study of March, they will include the ""dry stack tailings"". Next, what is called ""Optimize the project design and engineering"" will be realized, which I would replace with ""change"" instead of ""optimize"".2. On the other hand, they make it clear that ""Necessary permits and government support required to resume construction."", for me the term ""government support"" is important.The conclusion I draw is that there is an attempt to approach the Greek government, softening the possible points of friction ""dry stock tailings"".But the most important thing is not what it says, but what it does not say, they do not talk about arbitration, nor the resolution of April, nor the metallurgical part. It only mentions the need to work with the Greek government.Speculation:The resolution of the arbitration is not important for EGO, they give it as positive (otherwise, it would be mentioned in the presentation). But they know that for the construction of the mine they need the approval of the Greek Government.It's just my opinion, what do you think?",
"I'm looking on the bright side, the Greek government has the opportunity to create more millionaires in one day than the UK creates in one year! The order limit I placed this morning for $1.06 could only be half filled by today's end. That gave me a very good indication where the bottom is as far as the public is concerned. I'm hoping the rest will go thru at the opening, at that point I'll fix a sell limit and go on vacation. Hopefully I'll come home a millionaire!",
Added at $1.06..,
We really like the Lamaque assets. It's on Canada a friendly jurisdiction and project will move forward. No investing advice.,
"Even if April doesn’t work out, there are lots of opportunity with this company including somebody buying the assets.",
"Possible reason of the delayed annual announcement..""2018 is already proving to be a busy year, full of catalysts, with development underway at Lamaque and new or updated technical studies for Lamaque, Skouries and Kisladag. All three studies are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter, which will then drive the plan for the remainder of the year.  Our overarching goal for 2018 and beyond is to move Eldorado back into a growth phase and create value for all our stakeholders.""",
Well that explains your reactions here in SA land.. Hopefully you won't put that much equity into a company such as EGO again.. I don't your DCA so not sure if you'll be ok.. I'm looking for $2- $2.50 myself for a decent size profit.. It's possible that it can go higher if all the stars align.. If April becomes problematic then my loss will be very minimal..,
"Yes many.. haven't you been reading my comments?.. I'll sum it up I'm comfortable being long EGO with ""speculation money"" with a DCA of about $1.17 and I'm looking to lower it.. I would be concerned if I put in a full investment meaning a large % of your equity in EGO.. It seems that you went that route?",
If I get the chance I'll give a try..,
Your link is all Greek to me..,
"Here's a scenario nobody is thinking about. EGO had won every arbitration so it is likely they'll win. Now.. add in a spike in gold which is certainly very possible this year and you'll have an exceptional catalyst to take this stock much higher as it is trading at ridiculous levels. If gold is $1600+ and Greek assets cleared, I say EGO trades at $4.00+.",
"So much discussion but bottom line is - there are many PM miners with a more assured future, lower risks and higher returns than EGO offers today.",
Interesting how no one even mentions the vastly overpaid Integra Gold purchase as part of its ongoing projects,
"Like NAK, EGO is just too risky to invest my money!  Think I will buy a lottery ticket instead.  Cheers!",
"Maybe today is the Day! Come on EGO, BREAKOUT! This is like watching water freeze!",
... and even though They dont get the permit.... uncertainty is less... and the stock price might go Up.Book value is about 4... and P/B close to 4. IT can not continue...,
Long EGO adding at these levels..,
Thanks for the article. I just don't know having read it if you like the company or not.,
Yes. Agreed. For me it’s all been distilled down to a company that gives you Skouries and it’s elephant scale potential for no cost. The Greek shareholders who have commented occasionally have handicapped the arbitration result as favouring EGO for reasons that make a good deal of sense. Kisladag engineering a startup for Lamaque are potential near term catalysts as well. Buying daily in here.,
"Currently the market valued in 250 $ million each of the 4 main assets of EGO (Lamaque, Kisladag, Olimpyas phase II and Efencukuru) and gives a value of 0 $ to Skouries, Olympias phase III and other projects. Honestly, even with a negative result in Greece I think the action is undervalued. Personally I think that there are more chances of obtaining a positive result than a negative one, the probabilities that I apply, in the absence of more information, are the following 33% favorable, 33% favorable but have to make some kind of modification to obtain the permit and 33% do not have the permit. In short, bet on heads or tails with 66% to continue with development and 33% to no.",
"Well, if that didn't shake my attitude toward EGO then I've got ice water in my veins. I think I'll buy a couple more shares. Now, who do I need to talk to in Greece to see things in the proper light?",
Seems like a very narrow view. The company has other assets in development and is very undervalued at this PPS. The upside is far greater than the downside potential.,
Thanks for the article I don't really see that you brought anything new to the table through it. That said perhaps that is indicative of how closely watched this stock is and thus how highly volatile it will be around the earnings (March 21st after market) and April 6th for arbitration.,
Good piece but I don't understand your last sentence. You imply that these ETFs will have the same returns as EGO?,
As much as you sound negative on this i believe you will be surprised with the outcome of the arbitration. Their backup plan is appealing their decision if it’s negative n it won’t be lol n seek their high order court with the funny wigs n costumes to overrule the govt no 2 wait another year n the govt will be replaced (Elections) with a more willing administration to employ 3000 mean looking miners lol n no3 yepp sell EGO to Barrick Gold to assist them in regaining their position with Newmont 😊 make CANADA great again 😎,

Will it suddenly be different the next decade?  I wouldn't bet on it.",
"Your 30% production growth is overstated because it does not account for its working interest share of Guyana, Mozambique and PNG and the government share and decline of existing production.

"XOM is a company that many 'investors' love to hate.  I've owned the shares for decades.  Share prices fluctuate.  XOM's mgmt does a good job, IMO.  Some investors disagree with me on that score.  The Dividend has been respectable over the years.  I continue to buy additional shares each time Mr. Market decides to throw XOM under the Bus.  I like to hedge my positions with Options which enhances the internal rate of return.All in all, income, safety, good management, price fluctuations as buying opportunities -- what's not to like.Oh, and 'XOM hasn't moved in 10 years"" -- well, if you know how to invest -- that statement shows complete ignorance of how to invest by looking only at share price appreciation.  How much is 10-20 years of dividends worth as reinvestment or to acquire growth shares that were hammered by Mr. Market.  The recipe works and XOM is the basis.",

Despite the Model 3 hiccups, Tesla will prevail in this department with their vertical integration of self driving, batteries, and automation. It’s not a race either.

"You are correct in that Tesla has nothing to fear from the competition, it is self-destructing.It's fine to talk about economies of scale – after all, I teach the associated economics models on a regular basis. But for an investor you need to be able to show they actually are relevant. What part of the battery cell manufacturing process benefits from scale? – material width and deposition rates limit process speeds, so what you end up with are multiple lines. Perhaps, eventually, Tesla can get the pack assembly portion of the plant running smoothly, and can handle the output of more than one cell line. Right now, though, by Tesla's own investor calls, that step is a bottleneck, not a source of scale economies. So what they have is low nominal capacity utilization, the exact opposite of economies of scale. Furthermore, while every little bit of cost reduction is good, one pack assembly line is not going to result in a qualitative cost advantage for Tesla's (or any other maker's) products.",
"Looking at coming electric cars like the iPace or Porsche's MissionE as targeting Tesla's Model S/X is wrong headed on a very basic level.It is not as though there was an existing market of customers who only buy electric cars and Tesla has somehow conquered that market. Tesla hasn't stolen a bunch of BEV customers from the competition. Tesla has stolen a lot of high-end ICE car customers away from the likes of Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Lexus, Cadillac.... Tesla has plenty of competition today. In fact, Tesla has had a lot of competition from day one.People buying $100,000+ Model S Teslas are choosing to buy the Tesla instead of buying some other car for that $100k. For many customers with this much to spend for a car, the Tesla would appear to be the preferred choice over any number of high-end ICE cars. I don't think many people are settling for a Tesla when what they really wanted was an S Class or a BMW 7 Series.If and when other manufacturers start delivering BEVs in the performance / size / price class of Tesla cars, the primary competition for these new BEVs will be high-end ICE cars, just as is the case for Tesla. And there are a lot more high-end ICE customers to be won over to BEVs than there are Tesla customers ready to defect to some other BEV carmaker... So, for a new BEV to be good enough to offer competition to Model S, that new BEV will necessarily be good enough to offer competition to Mercedes, Audi, Lexus, BMW, Cadillac... And, guess what, there are a lot more high-end ICE cars for the new entrant BEV to compete against than there are Teslas... To say nothing of the fact that these coming BEVs are going to be sold through ICE car dealers and sit in the very same showroom as their likely ICE competition. It is going to be VERY hard for legacy players with a Tesla competitive BEV to take sales away from Tesla without taking far more sales away from their existing high-end ICE products.",

"It takes a lot of guts to base a hypothesis on a graph that shows the upward trend in EV's is primarily due to China, and then completely discount Chinese BEVs to make your case that Tesla is the best.If Tesla can sell a BEV for $35,000 with the tax credit, maybe they'll be a big-time player. Otherwise, the sheer economics of the situation relegate it to a niche. The current price of the Model 3 relegates it to the top ten percent, and even then a lot of those can't afford it if they have a mortgage (like me.)",

"Wow, fantastic article. I am so tired of all the BS propaganda ( Balance Sheet) about Tesla, written by bears and shorts. I have asked them many times to calculate the ICE Cap X write downs that would be insured by old auto and the EV Cap X required by old auto to ramp up and compete fully in the EV market. By some estimates it would be north of $300 billion. Thats a lot finance over a short period of time.So old auto is using the same failed MBA logic that other have used in the past. Namely Kodak, Lucent, Northern Telecom, Nokia, Ericsson, Black Berry, Block Buster Video, Barns and Knoble Books and now Walmart. These companies did not want to take huge write downs of cap x and then also spend huge amounts of cap x to compete in the new market. While at the same time canalize their existing revenue streams. They all failed.So now GE is starting to crack due to massive shifts in its core industries. They are even taking about breaking up for "" share holder value"" . At this time old auto is using failed MBA logic and pursuing partnerships with Korea, China and a few other companies such as Bosh. These partnerships will give all strategic advantage to the EV drive makers as they will accrue supply chain dominance. Just like what happened in Telecom and Smart phones. Notice how Apple is the only vertical integrated smart phone manufacture. Apple is also accruing all the profit that would be shared in the supply chain. Just like Tesla. The big difference between Apple and Tesla is the fact Apple was forced to sign multi year exclusive agreements with China to secure long term salve labor. Tesla is not bound like Apple to China. Tesla is also not locked into decade long labor contracts like GM, Ford, Toyota and VW. Tesla is free to aggressively automate all production. Tesla is also not locked into permanent dealer agreements like 100% of old auto and is free to sell direct to consumers and reap even more of the margin that normally goes to the dealers. Additionally dealers make a huge percentage of their profits via service revenues on all the new cars sold. Tesla represents a technology disruption and a business model disruption. The one two punch to old auto and big oilIts hard to believe that shorts and bears still bet against silicon valley but they do.",

"Tesla now trails in many department and soon in others as well. Tesla is stuck with a charging network that can only recharge Tesla vehicles and wil be built by Tesla only. Every other automaker does (or soon will) use the superior CCS charging protocol, which, as the Porsche Missione e demontrated, can recharge more than  twice as fast as Tesla's ""Superchargers."" And CCS high power charging stations are being built by everyone (Euro automakers, Ionity, charging companies like evGo, oil companies,like Royal Dutch Shell,etc etc) because over 120 CCS electric car models will be in showrooms within the next three years. They will overwhelm Tesla , with its small number of models, several, the Model S and Model X, being niche products (which have displayed horrible sales this year so far, even with no direct competitiors on sale). The response to the upcoming Porsche Mission e electric, a direct competitor to the Model S (but with a far better price, not even counting Tesla's lack of govt tax credits leaves them with a $7500 price disadvantage against their competitors) has been so strong that Porsche has already expanded production to outsell the Model S, whose sales have cratered in 2018. Tesla also trails in autonomous driving, by a very wide margin - GM and one other being the leaders.

"Victor, another entertaining article.Interesting to read how you predict a financial storm from global debt  https://seekingalpha.c...-- and then extoll the most indebted auto company in the world as a superior investment.Flexible thinking to say the least.Yes, Tesla is gaining some share in the US and Europe in the EV space.Too bad EVs are less than 2% of the total vehicle market.In China, the largest market of all, Tesla is rapidly losing share.Care to ahre those numbers with us?Given that the Chinese government has promised to put something like $90 Billion behind Chinese companies to achieve global EV leadership, that would make me worry a bit.Of course, Today, Tesla is ahead, but 2025 is coming up soon.100 new EVs are slated to hit the global markets at all price points.Kodak was once #1, same for Xerox, GE, and Netscape. But things change.Tesla's claimed Technology Leadership I think is vastly overstated.The Woz certainly thinks so. http://bayareane.ws/2s...Consider AP. Google is actually running live taxi services in Phoenix, and has logged nearly a million miles of state certified tests. None of the Google projects have resulted in human death. As far as I know, Tesla is the only company who's AP has resulted in loss of life. GM has far better ABS to stop front end collisions.  All the years Tesla spent working with Mobileye based systems had to be scrapped when Mobileye pulled the plug because of the Florida death. As for the new system, how great is it if it can't see a parked red fire truck with flashing lights in broad daylight? And wasn't it supposed to be ready a year ago?According to a Navigant study, Tesla is dead last in AP achievement -- stepped exponential blather aside. Yes, Musk makes the best promises. But the reality falls short.As for staying at the cutting edge, Tesla makes a big deal out of hiring a chip designer. Fine. But does it make sense for a tiny car company to go alone at solving autonomous AP when you consider the other horses in the race? Or the standards likely to be legislated for highway safety?The other horses in the AP race include all the OEMs, in various teams, with $ 900+ Billion in market caps, and huge financial resources; the the chip companies -- NVDA, INTC, MU, Samsung, and QCom; weighing in with another $800 Billion in market cap; and don't forget about Apple and Google. How can Tesla win that race with its finances stretched over cars, car parts, selling cars, servicing cars, charging cars, solar, battery storage, building factories, etc.? They are $20+ Billion short of having the required funds.When GM or Toyota develops an AP system, they can amortize the costs over 20+ million cars a year. Tesla will have at best a few 100,000 cars a year, meaning the cost per vehicle will be orders of magnitude larger than their competitors.Whatever technology Tesla has can probably be knocked off fast and cheaply.The cars are already being pulled apart.And if some amazing new technology is discovered, who will the inventor go to -- Tesla, with a small fleet, and limited cash, or GM or Toyota or Google who have the ready cash to pay whatever it takes to lock it up?And you can say the same about Lithium or Cobalt. Apple is said to be talking directly to the mining companies to ensure future supplies -- which is easier and more credible when you have $300 Billion in ready cash. Without these metals, Tesla (actually Panasonic) can't make batteries.China has already locked up a quarter or more of global supply of strategic metals and rare earths.  And China, will pay up for, (or steal), whatever tech they need/want to become a global auto superpower, as they have done before for dozens of other industries.If Tesla does open a China plant, say goodby to any tech edge, since all source code will need to be shared as a matter of law.China is a pretty good bet to disrupt Tesla.So yes, Tesla makes great cars; and yes Tesla TODAY leads in small sub-sectors of the global auto market. (100,000 cars out of a global market of 80 Million).But they seem to be clueless about manufacturing. Tesla has already made 250,000 battery packs for the S and the X. So please explain why they are having such trouble with the packs for the 3 when the only difference is that the cells for the 3 are just slightly larger?Tesla AP kills people, and they can't make battery packs. Not what I'd expect from a ""Market Leader"".",

We all know Tesla pretends Model S is a luxury full size salon but reality is that it is sized and priced like a midsize luxury salon, full stop.What's the story there for European sales? Tesla S 16K, E Class 127K, 5 series 110K, A6 79K. Not bad for a brand with such a short history but by no means a market leader.In the US we have Tesla S 20K, E Class 35K, 5 series 28K and Lexus ES 39K.

"First mover advantage is far overstated. Tesla has no moat and worse, it has competitors that can EASILY turn out cars equal to or better than what Tesla has. The battery is off the shelf technology, designing and assembling cars is something that Tesla is obviously NOT very good at, Tesla has no dealer network, a major disadvantage when Teslas have to be service by Tesla. And Tesla is broke in a highly capital intensive business. Other car companies didn't make EV's because they allowed Tesla to lose a fortune developing the market. They also knew that the cars could not yet be made at acceptable prices (which is why Model 3 does NOT cost $35K). Their decision not to have them yet was a conscious strategic decision. I really laugh when the author says that Tesla has some kind of advantage over everyone!!!!!",
Victor“EV’s are gearing up to take over the automotive world” Total nonsense.Maybe in China and a couple EU nations but that’s it.

Saying that the Mission E won't compete with the Model S is complete nonsense and discredits the entire competitor argument. It is 1000% its direct competitor and will blow away the Model S in terms of build quality as well as maintenance and post purchase support. The Mission E is the biggest competitor threat to Tesla as it attacks its bread and butter.,

"The EV market is gaining more traction, but the key is volume. TSLA is still effectively a ""bespoke"" car company that sells to enthusiasts.

It's still far from proven that they can scale to that level.You can be sure that when the majors start rolling out their offerings (beyond the ""pilot projects"" they've done so far) that they'll be available in volume on Day 1.",
"You put 1 million total sales of EVs & plugin and half of them being pure EV. TSLA only ships less than 100k cars. So there are others. People do not buy a car just because its an EV. They will buy if the EV provides savings (in fuel consumption). If a model 3 costs 50k and a similar size prius plugin costs 30k, its more cost effective to buy a prius plugin. Vast majority of 1 million EV & plugins sold came to their owner at a price of 30k or lower. (Because of tax credits all over the world). If a Mistubishi Outlander plugin is available at 33k(27k after the tax break) and Toyota Rav4 at 27k, some might buy the Outlander. If Ioniq EV is available at 29k (19k after the tax breaks) and Toyota Corrolla is 20k, people might buy ioniq EV. The whole idea of 500k people signing up for a 35k model 3 is because they thought they can get a luxury EV at 25k (35k-10k tax credits). TSLA's dominance at model S is because they competed well with the price. Vast majority of cars sold world wide costs 30k or less. Some countries have 100% or more import taxes on cars. TM is the world's most dominant auto maker is not because they have the best technology, they showed the best execution. TSLA has not shown it in model 3. They have a long way to go. If you look at the rest of the world, TM, Nissan, Honda has hybrid SUV's that goes close to 50 mpg. If they add 30 miles battery only range (like Kia Niro plugin), that would be enough for 95% of the people. It will do wonders for environment and meeting the goals for the automakers. Then there are battery companies, self driving car companies... they can potentially become a big player. I sold my TSLA shares at 360s. If TSLA shares hit 360+ at the end of the year, I might consider buying put options. TSLA is an amazing company. They will survive and do well. For them to be valued more them BMW, it is over valued. BMW has a healthy 8-10% profit margin and they sell around 2 million cars per year. It will take TSLA 5 years to hit those goals and it may plateau around that number. Meaning TSLA may be worth that 60B market cap 5 years from now. Its over priced today at 57B market cap today.",
"Interesting how the model 3 needs 42 psi to achieve that range.  However with no air suspension the complaints of a harsh ride are abundant.  I do believe Tesla will sell at least 200,000 of those model 3 reservation vehicles, but after that the demand will fade and so will the stock price.  Valuations ultimately matter.  You may see 400 per share this year, and it will lasso in one more group of suckers before starting its decent.  Remember longs, this stock is already priced for a perfect future for Tesla.",

"Thanks for an article that doesn't trash Tesla! And makes the most important points that the bears refuse to see.1. Competitors are losing 20% a year of market share against Tesla.2. This is a classic case of disruptive innovation. The Germans have told me margins on a gas engine are 90%. They will never stop selling them until they wind up like Nokia.3. The Tesla car is so much better than the competition, for most people once you drive one you never look back. Every rental I get now is such a piece of trash compared to my P100D. Even when I paid $500 a day to upgrade to a Mercedes sports car it was still trash compared to the Tesla.The only thing the bears have going for them is the hope that Tesla will run out of money. Good luck ...",
"Victor 1) Your EV growth graph seems to be driven by a country that TSLA doesnt sell into & likely at a price point way lower that TSLA can even dream of achieving.2) The Ipace in the UK is pricing at the low end exactly at the price of the model X 75 (which I thought was the cheapest Tesla X out there) is it coming out in the US at a different price?3) The Ipace has actually been roadtested for over a year by professional drivers and then retooled for public release. Its also backed by a real service network and a well funded company, and I am guessing they can produce them at the same rate as TSLA produces X. How does your argument about no competitors at all apply to this car (especially given the charging method is the generic EU port, not TSLA only)?4) Dismiss Audi at your peril.

Congrats to Tesla for being number 1 in a small market share within a small market share within a small market share. The problem nobody wants to talk about is Tesla losing about 4% of the EV Market share in the US and about 2% of the EV market share worldwide in 2017. In other words Tesla went from about 29.97% to just over 25% in the US and went from about 9% to just over 7% worldwide. Tesla is not a leader but a small niche company that fills a small niche of the EV market.,

Victor that had better be the case because the market already sees it that way from a market cap perspective.  Tesla overtook GM in market cap earlier today and if you want to compare EV well Tesla exceeds GM by a mile.  So if that wasn’t the case I would say Tesla is in real trouble.,

"Also, noticed that Zack has ORC as a strong sell... What's that line of thinking? Anyone has any insights to share?",
Scott - Thanks for the article...,
Would someone please explain just how the  QBI deduction works??  I own a very large quantity of ORC shares.,
"Scott,I hold ORC in two ways: both as the stock itself (ORC), and also as part of a much larger basket of stocks in an ETN (MORL).I just found the following tidbit as part of an article regarding snaffus in the new tax bill. Do you (or any of the readers) know anything about it and if it affects ETNs and ETFs the same way it affects mutual funds? Here is the text: “Another glitch allows people investing in real estate to claim a new deduction for pass-through income – but only if they own real estate stocks directly. If they own them through mutual funds, as many Americans do, they don’t qualify for the break.”",
I am LONG ON ORC AND AI.,
"ORC is a depleting asset. ERTI excludes hedge losses and unrealized losses on the portfolio. Hence, this metric tells you nothing about ""economic return"", which in ORCs case has been less than 4% per annum since its public float. ORC has consistingly lost money on its portfolio and its hedges, both, which isn't easy to do. It requires an exceptional level of incompetence.",
"Hi Scott,Pardon my curiosity but to what extent do you place emphasis on ROC from a REIT, like NLY in this instance? It seems to be a warning sign to watch future payouts.Looking at their expansion into additional areas, the commercial side is a very small part of the business and doesn't appear to offset stress in their main business. Nice articles on PSEC and ORC.Dean",
Scott thanks for all you do. I can't tell you how much value you add to my decision making process. I wish you the best.,
Thanks for the update on ORC.,
Thanks Scott!Your prediction on ORC was correct. Now the stock price is depressed and I believe it is a good opportunity to buy ORC.,

How should the ballooning shares outstanding be interpreted in regards to dividend sustainability? At what point is there just too many shares out there forcing another dividend cut?,
"At .11 x 12 =  $ 1.21 per share for 2018 which  makes a very good monthly return of 17%  for $7 per share and a nice return 14% with for those who still have it at $8.5 per share with a $1.5 capital loss/share, if it does not go up by the end of 2018.   Covered monthly returns in risk areas above 14% with buy orders from different sources are hard to find.  As long as too many of these risky eggs are not in one basket then  chances of getting totally burned is dispersed. I may put another 30% on this ORC horse.",

good stuff...,Explaining Orchid Island Capital's Recent Dividend Reduction (Includes March-May 2018 Dividend Projection)
Dumpy Doodle Doo recently.,
"Darren, I'm certainly surprised, not what I expect from an insurance company that just had a terrible financial year. Now BCRH is a tiny insurance company, no more than petty cash compared to the big boys. Based on the dividend, it certainly is an interesting speculation.I bought a few shares today.",
"BCRH just declared a 30¢ dividend in line with previous. Some people were worried about them cutting the dividend to build back up book, apparently they didn't feel the need to go in that direction.",
I weathered the storm with this company and will be averaging up.,
"I bought a small amount of BCRH today. I will buy more if and when the company does the capital raise that I expect will be forthcoming. Zachs has a 2018 estimate of $ 1.28 per share. So the dividend I would guess will be about $ .30 to $ .40 for 2018, which allows for some growth in book value.The stock is certainly not a big value, Hawk, after the huge loss of 2017 and deserves to sell a discount.Trade in Mexico, we will know a year from now how big the profit rebound will be.  This security belongs in the ""ultra high"" risk basket of an investor's portfolio.Larry",
"Hawk, after a drubbing in book value, wouldn't you expect a similar decrease in eps and therefore dividends? Moreover if this was my company, I would re-instate the dividend with some conservatism, in order to more quickly rebuild equity. So I would look for a dividend more like $ .15 to $ .25 per share for the first quarter. ""Experienced management"" in this high risk business should turn the ship slowly, preserving capital. If and when the stock price rises, wouldn't you expect a major stock issuance? How better than to replace that big capital loss from last year? I believe these ""headwinds"" explain the price selling below book value.Larry",
"Based on a few comments made by some misinformed people here, there is obviously some confusion about the dividend.  I think that when BCRH announces the regular 30 cent div around mid March, this stock will move higher.",
"To Darren McCammon:""The actuaries judge Florida's 2017 Hurricane a 1 in 100 event."" That's a solid piece of data to know. However, depending on the company's geographical coverage, a negative event similar in magnitude to the hurricane in Florida could happen in some other form (e.g., earthquake, mudslides, fires) elsewhere. It would be helpful to know if the company's reinsurance business is geographically well diversified. I would assume it is.",
"I'm long BCRH and like it, but that Financial Highlights slide shows that the big loss in 2017 destroyed all of the gains in book value and dividend from 2014, 2015, and 2016.  For BCRH to be a good investment, years like 2017 have to happen a lot less often than one in four (which, to be clear, I think they likely will).Because BCRH is a re-insurer, it has a certain picking up nickels in front of a steamroller flavor to it.  It's really important that they be able to pick up enough nickels to pay for the steamroller damage when it happens, and it's not so easy to assess whether they are on course to do that.",
"I also think this a solid buy for the reasons the author stated.  Historically BCRH has traded in the 0.9x book range.  I always thought 1.1x book more appropriate since it has almost no correlation with the rest of the market.  How often can you find something paying a high dividend which actually lowers the overall risk in your portfolio by adding it?  I think that deserves a bit of a premium, not a discount.",
usually they pay at the end of feb - but announce earlier.  The lack of announcement so far indicates to me they might be mulling their options there.,

In view of the Audit Committee's investigation, the Company no longer intends to post responses to these allegations."" So now the company ""has knowledge"" that the DOJ is involved. And now the company has decided to no longer respond to the allegations, something that they have done with earnest since last summer.It sure as heck seems like the CEO has been taking us for a ride, and the chips are falling a little bit at a time.

"JIMBO IS just trying to talk the stock down he is a really devoted bear here it must be his job assignment.  I’ve started public companies several times and giving stock to thought leaders and influencers is not illegal it’s sort of common practice amongst founders, no biggie!  Until the fat lady sings meaning the lawyers and the investigation is complete  the stock is a spec.  And open to bear fear ,mongering as well as bull puffery.  I think this is setting up a fabulous opportunity because if they are mostly in the clear this is a huge buying opportunity.  I’d expect a big gap up or down probably more up than down as they appear to have a proven accepted product that irrespective of short term possible operational violations that will cost and take time to settle out there is real earnings going forward value.  As I write this I’m convincing myself to buy some more as a long term investment. As I now recall Pete Petite bought 250,000 shares last year how crazy would he have to be to do that knowing of constant bear assaults. The guy is old ( so am I ) and already rich ( me too!), does he need this excitement in his “golden years”?  Indictments and endless lawyers?  Anything is possible but I’m thinking of probables.  I can use some excitement tho!I return to my initial observation that this was handled in an untypical fashion if you had been following this company’s behavior. They always seemed to be forthwith on transparency and here, suddenly, they spring this bomb on their shareholders.   lt was way out of character!  I’d expect they, the management, would have called a conference call and said we are putting these bear attacks to a final test by establishing an outside investigation of all issues that have been raised by bears so our quarterly will be delayed until that is concluded.  IT WAS NOT DONE THAT WAY,  the usual MDXG WAY.  SO I think the audit committee went behind managements back and secretly instigated the investigation and when they were surprised to find they ran out of time before the filing date they had to bomb us longs and management with the facts or violate the securities laws 5hemselves.

XBI being an equal weight fund, will, on the third Friday of March, have to offer for sale a substantial chunk of its MDXG holdings, in line with MDXG's relative performance vs. its peers. Below $3, MDXG is at risk of fully being dropped from XBI. There's a number of other equal weight ETFs holding MDXG. I hope it's not the retail investors who will be suckered in to bid then.",

Going from great growth into playing on the company’s strengths on placental tissue!  As they move forward onto territory of great market size opportunity. BESIDE THAT WONDERFUL FUTUREI may be a conspiracy believer but this was handled in a very UN MDXG manner.  The expected way would have been for management to have scheduled  a conference call and explained and contextualized the announcement.  This seems like it was a surprise to management and I’d guess that either of a few things happened.  The Audit Committee tried a coup d Etat by quietly hiring outside counsel to undercut management. And the study/investigation ran to long and interferes with the Q filing.thus it had to be made public prior to competition.  If this was by demand of E&Y they could have undertaken, happily the task  ( at billable hours, thank you!)  or it was an outside regulatory enforcement or else kind of offer you can’t refuse “suggestion/request/gu...  Anyhow it was out of the ordinary and that is curious.Anyway it was handled in a most unnatural method for this management team.  They would have timed the investigation to not interfere with the Q required report. But in fact it did and that is the only reason management first likely heard of the internal investigation.  This a few days lag from the bombshell announcement.So there will be a listen only call, that also is an unusual method for this management and it’s transparent posture.This will be a very interesting call but not bringing finality to anything, I think!If there is to be some minor restatement of years past accounting I think it no big deal but considering the highly charged positions of the bulls and bears I’d expect overreaction by bears and an add to your positions bulls.

"Nvidia is not going to go into a freefall, IMHO, mostly because they are well balanced between the major world markets. Nvidia manufactures in Asia, and being US based, is not likely to be hit with tariffs, and even if they are, it is not likely to be enough to discourage a miner or gamer to not buy because of a small cost increase. Finished gaming products have gone up 50% in four months and the supply demand balance is still skewed toward sellers more than buyers. A falling NVDA stock price is unpleasant for holders, but not for potential buyers. We are not even close to a blow off tech top, based upon my experiences during the Y2K NASDAQ bubble. We have yet to experience the high level of euphoria of those days. The big buying opportunity for NVDA is if the day comes where release earnings only mildly exceed expectations. In those days following that ER I personally would be a heavy buyer.With the return of volatility comes the return of fear of loss (FOL) which begins to supplant the greed inherent in the fear of missing out (FOMO). When any stock goes up rapidly, there is a certain element of buyers who buy only because it is going up. They don't understand anything about the company they ""invested"" in.They wash themselves out when it shows any sign of weakness and they rotate to names that are going up.

The market wont let it go past the value of Intels computing business(es), without showing some more (financial) proof its technology is better than Intels. We can talk AI all we want, but the market will not put a big value tag on that just yet. Markets want financial proof, and its still a year away when some bigger numbers come rolling in that can be put into models and spreadsheets, and big money gets their ""a-ha moments"". But it will always be to little as its difficult to over-predict growth in AI.For us that understand the technology, the capabilities and the competitive strength of NVIDIA , this stock will be a bargain deal for a long long time. All the while you can reap a yearly 20-30% gain. I'll take it. Life is so much easier when you can escape the more expensive parts of the stock-market.",
Today is a horrible day for Nvidia!  How can Netflix soar over $290/share and Nvidia sits flat on it's face??  What is going on with the manipulation on Nvidia and a clear intentional sign of keeping the valuations suppressed.,

Data center is hardly penetrated, auto revenue hasn't even kicked in yet, and the plethera of uses for AI hasn't even been explored yet, although NVDA is working hard to widen the TAM, from drones to video monitoring ( crime cams, etc - billions of hours of video never watched could be watched in realtime ).  End then there's Esports and every other trend.... so anyway , GLTA, but long NVDA!",

Just 2 points, first if crypto buying went to zero, all GPUs would still be sold out due to gaming demand (core base cannot get product) and that would not be at a discount, just not at resale markup.

Why don’t you own NVDA?,
It’s rather concerning how an author can completely switch stances on a company without acknowledging. “Continued upward trend”? Do you even recall what you’ve predicted about NVDA/AMD before??,
"I know you never read comments and are just here for clicks, but it's worth pointing out to readers that this unsourced assertion is particularly weird: ""Cryptos generate approximately 10% of the company's revenue, compared to approximately 3% of revenue for rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).""Lisu Su herself said that crypto was around 6-7% of revenue or so.  Nvidia hasn't provided that much detail.  It's very strange that this author is presenting these numbers as if they're facts.  I have no idea how he arrived at them.  Honestly, it's pretty likely he just created them and was like ""yeah, this is probably about right.""",
"Volatility driven by the algos which has nothing to do with intrinsic value in this case (and many others).  Yes, buy the dip.",
"""this phase promises to resolve into a continued upward trend as a result of growing demand in the enterprise segment.

The dip was just a buying opportunity.  Over the long run Nvidia will far outperform the S&P 500 even if it’s affected by short term volatility.,

There seems to be a Sangamo clinical trial on HIV patients involving mutating CCR5 in vivo to essentially create HIV immune T cells in the patient. wonder how that went and if Gilead would be interested in that given it could be a big competition to (if not a 'better mouse trap' than) Gilead's existing HIV therapies if successful,
"Great article!  I also very much applaud and agree with the direction SGMO has taken thus far; collaborations and partnerships.  As promising as their technology is, and as much progress that have shown to date, until we see data from patients, in vivo results if you would, SGMO has ‘little to show’. So that’s why these collaboration at this early stage make so much sense.  Partner with BP, secure big upfront payments, offload much of the cost of development and commercialization, realize still more milestone payments along the way, and then eventually royalties.  It’s a beautiful thing.  And of course this helps to mitigate a great deal of risk that if they didn’t enter into this agreement would be entirely on them.  One failure, one bad data readout, one expensive quarter Expense wise, etc. etc.  and it’s all on them.  And thereby threatening cash on hand, market cap, SP with a dilutive capital raise, etc.  What these agreements do is put cash immediately in the bucket, offset risk, mitigate need to raise cash, all which allow them to continue development unimpeded.  Again, a beautiful thing.But my question is, are these collaborations/partner... the business model for the foreseeable future?  At what point, if at all, do they go after indications entirely on their own?  And as long as they have the cash to do so, and as long as they deliver results and data, ie.  successes that mitigate risk but more importantly deliver definitive efficacy and safety, from these collaborations and current studies.  Going alone has a much bigger pay day.  So do you think that is part of the plan? Developing and keeping more indications to themselves?Finally, the criticism I see about this deal and previous deals is that they ‘gave away’ too much.  That the upfront payments and/or milestone payments were too small and that the royalty structure also too small (low double digits vs. 50% or even higher). What are your thoughts on the structure of the deal itself.  Could SGMO have significantly done better, if so , why didn’t they?",
"Any thoughts on the impact of the LNP IP litigation settlement between Arbutus and Acuitas?(Acuitas has No Further Rights to Use or Sublicense Arbutus LNP TechnologyArbutus Consolidates LNP Patent Estate Enabling RNAi, mRNA, and Gene-editing Therapeutics)I thought Sangamo was working with Acuitas.",

"Question...If GILD is going to be paying 3bn or maybe even more if things are successful, if GILD were to then buy SGMO wouldn't they be getting like a 3bn discount since they wouldn't have to pay that upcoming 3bn to themselves?",
"Excellent article, well written and informative. I will be looking more into SGMO as a result, including your earlier article. Am I correct that your best estimate/guess may mean that significant revenue from SGMO may not reasonably be expected for about two years?, ( I realize that this is only your opinion for a spec type stock)If you do detect significant inside selling that seems unusual (not the usual tax related or pre-planned/required selling etc, would appreciate a comment up date in the future.Thanks",
The science of what they are doing is great stuff.  The other pharma's that are partnering also conclude this - to invest now and ongoing into it.   The company has no long term debt to speak of - a big positive.  Many positives here....The only one negative I wonder about is that the insiders selling shares as soon as they get them.   Therefore --- overall insider ownership is very very low.   Thoughts?,

"The ""Game Changing"" about this deal is that CEO's and BOD's work against their shareholders for personal gain.  It's a sham from top to bottom.  It was implemented in stages to isolate the shareholders on the back of lies.Absolutely no reason RAD couldn't continue as a standalone until a competent CEO worked the asset into a decent return for shareholders.  Which is what a CEO is paid to do.  A BOD is paid to keep the CEO in line and replace him if need be.This is a case of incestuous corporate governance.  John Standley and the BOD will go down in history for this sleazy deal.  There's nothing above board about it.  It's a cowardly way to steal assets from people who worked and saved and invested.  Albertsons cannot even come up with 2.50 in value for this deal.  Hell, an offer of 2.25 blows this bullshit away.  Someone will make a lowball offer and they'll have cash.   We might get a very low price thanks to the worthless asshole we have for a CEO, but Ablertsons won't succeed in stealing RAD for 1.70, which is about the maximum value they're offering in this deal.",
"This deal is realistically $1.68. Standley is taking $2 bil and giving it to Cerebus, pocketing $20+ million for himself, landing a 7 figure job, and robbing everyshareholder of $2.32/share. The market knows this is a sham deal and won't pay a premium for it. The Newco stock will immediately trade down to the $16-17 level , or worse if the market is in a correction or downturn. Vote no, email the FTC, SEC, and your Congressmen/women today.",
Major regret not being able to get out of $2.23 then $2.15.. Now we're back to $1 land.. We were legally robbed..,
sad to see they robed us,
"I find it hard to believe that some better heeled company won't offer at least $3 for RAD and have real cash to pay it off.   Albertsons will be out of the picture immediately.  I'm only hoping that the buyer stipulates that Standley must be fired first.WBA could make another grab with divestitures to divide up the remaining stores for FTC approval.  Hell, this would play right into Pessina's hands. Now this would really make John Standley look like the all time chump of CEO's.  I'm praying Pessina does this!",
"Now that it appears Walgreens has ended T/O talks with AmerisourceBergen, it is now supposedly looking at a possible Express Scripts bid. In another article, it was believed that Buffett/Bezos/Dimon were leaning towards an Express Scripts acquisition as well. Obviously only one could be successful. The other might then take a new look at RAD because of it. Another attempt at RAD by WBA would not be out of line if additional store divestitures were offered to Albertsons, Kroger,  and possibly Freds as well, leaving them with the PBM they now seem to be looking for at a cost far less than an Express Scripts. New FTC might not object either. Just some seed for chipmunks ......",
"At 2.04 we can all see just how much faith the market has in Standley and his team of lapdogs.  If a real deal were on the table with a buyer who could pay anything except preposterously overstated stock, this would be at 2.35.  Even a cash offer of 2.50 will blow this deal away.  Sometime in the next few weeks, we'll see someone make a real offer for valuable assets that Standley wants to give away for personal payment to his checking account.This sets a new standard for executive greed.",
Will all Albertsons have a pharmacy within them? With the lower drug rates and double the footprint can make it worth more.,
"Amazing how bad of a deal this is. Perspective of the deal is 100% negative outside of Camp Hill, PA. There are zero pros to the deal for RAD. It’s about Standley and his checking account. Can’t see how this ever gets Shareholder approval. Oust this fool and bring in a true operational leader that can run this company.",
This will be a case study in corporate ethics.,
The RAD board is a disgrace. They have protected Standley since day one. The board has never looked out for shareholders and this rotten deal proves it.,
"There will be TREMENDOUS scrutiny of this deal.  It's hard to believe Standley and company were so stupid that they proposed this.  It makes it very clear who the enemy of RAD shareholders actually is.  No way this gets approved, because it's outright stealing and cannot remotely be justified. Even this group of lapdogs on the BOD will not be able to defend Standley when this deal blows up.  And we have to pay Albertson's 65 million because our CEO and BOD agreed to this?  This may not stand up in court.  Either way, I think it's the end of Standley and the BOD when the smoke clears.",
Can anybody explain why Standley did this deal (besides his fat bonus and keeping CEO title)? I can’t think of one good reason for shareholders why this deal was done in rush. RAD was better off staying RAD and we would at least have a chance to run to 4$. This was a bag on the head deal.,
So for Standley this deal was better than WBA ?,
"Yes we were taken.. it happens legally on Wall st all the time.. until and unless important people with influence speak up we are victims.. Regardless it was still, a great bargain under $1.50 where most of my shares were purchase.. So many feared RAD at those levels and disagreed with me on my ""bad"" purchases.. I did have some epic failures on BKD & RUBI's BO offers scenarios.. An important and expensive lesson.. With all the cash eventually coming in from WBA not buying at $1.38 was now in hindsight insane..  Everyone had the opportunity to lower the DCA..  GL longs..",
I got to give ICON credit.  He called this one dead on.  Anything touched by Standley will end up bad for those who invest in a company he owns.,
folks please submit complaints to SEC - they need to investigate this merger before its too late. I have done so.,
"It's easy to see why this deal is one sided. Robert Miller served as the Chairman of Rite Aid Corporation from December 5, 1999 to June 2007 and is the Chairman and CEO of Albertsons. If I'm not mistaken him, Standley and a few others came over surprisingly to Rite Aid from Fred Meyers after Rite Aids financial scandal in 1999. Miller and Standley go WAY back...So I cannot imagine this Alberstons deal has anything  to do with loyalty, or greed :-). I think the more I see the back story here from the past you can easily see why a poison pill was put in place. Both CEOs on this deal will personally benift (Miller gets RAD back and now does not have to answer to his creditors as he did in the past), they have set this up so it's unlikely someone else will bid. How is any of this to the benefit of a RAD shareholder? Not only that, they are going to screw WBA in the process when they re-open stores in Albertsons as Rite Aids in some of the territories they sold off. And I'd be willing to bet why they mentioned they are likey going to re-negotiate with McKesson as I suspect WBA is not to happy about this move. My guess probably a big reason why the Rite Aid merger deal changed last minute with WBA, probably had nothing to do with FTC approval. Heck even the FTC denied they blocked the original merger... They knew if the WBA merger failed Albertsons could scoop up Rite Aid on the cheap, work out a new deal which would ultimately screw WBA, and keep RAD back under Miller's and Standley's control.",
i am starting to think ICON was RAD CEO - it all makes sense. RAD CEO sold out before even getting chance to prove what he did with WBA was good? So to keep him around - he just wiped the evidence and signed another deal obscure then WBA.What a crappy management!,
"The bar has been set very low.   Even an offer of 2.75 will be successful vs the deal that they've put together with Albertson's.  It's easy to beat.  If no one beats it, then that's what happens, a fire sale.  So the clock is ticking on a sale of the company.  RAD is in play for anyone who bids 2.75 or more for it, which is a figure Albertson's cannot match.  That's really the bottom line.  If Amazon or Kroger or Aldi or Dollar Tree or anyone else truly wants to buy this company for a bargain price, it's for sale.  We will know in the next few weeks.  If no one wants to buy it, then perhaps it's not worth much of anything.Should the Albertson's deal be approved, I'm out.  I have zero faith in Standley to run a lemonade stand, let alone a larger, more debt laden company with an outdated model in the Alberston's stores.  I don't see how anyone will have enough faith to invest in the new company, which will stumble into bankruptcy with Standley at the helm.  The new company will debut below $20.  That's what a weak deal this is.  It's not a deal for $2.50.  It's a deal for $2.",

nice,
it will do.both and continue to act like it has for quite a while,
"I posit that there is HOPE and that hope is when Cerberus roadshows this Rosemary's Baby of a reverse IPO that the interest is SO LOW they call it off.  We know they didn't take the offer they were rumored to be getting last time they shopped Albertson as IPO.....remember they gotta sell a lot of new stock.Just because these clowns put the price at 25 on a ppt preso don't mean they are getting 25.If the offer they are getting is REALLY bad (like less than 20) then Cerberus could leave Standley at the altar (like Pessina did last year) and this time the B.O.D. would have no choice but to rid RAD of Standley and his cronies.A new CEO by August and all else being equal (no mkt crash) RAD is at 3.50 by year end and ICON buys me a drink!FUN FACT:  In Greek mythology, Cerberus, often called the ""hound of Hades"", is the monstrous multi-headed dog that guards the gates of the Underworld to prevent the dead from leaving.",
"If Albertson's could acquire RAD, why wouldn't Kroger be interested?  At least they have their act together enough to offer CASH or trading stock in a buyout, rather than some murky, undetermined stock value.  I'm hoping for another bidder here, and soon.  Standley and the BOD have set the floor very low.  If Kroger offers 2.75, the deal will be approved.  Any strategic buyer hoping to put the nail in Albertson's could do that buy buying RAD out from under them.What could Kroger do with the PBM?",
"RAD stock trading as proxy for Albertson's at this point.Cerberus desperate to rid itself of this money loser.LONGS ARE SCREWED Where's my buddy ICON, need to get a drink .....",
Anyone know how shorts are behaving. Are they double down as this potentially can go down to 1.3 or covering as this can potentially go to 2.5,
.183 seems like a floor if the whole market falls in,
but if not 1.71 is a pretty good floor for this name,
i get it most people here are longer term shareholders with high average costs.,
THIS manipulation higher prices are coming,
"Yahoo shows RAD earnings of 15 cents for trailing 12 months.   https://yhoo.it/2sPBpFU    None of RADs debts are in default so far as I can tell, so they must have been able to service all their debt and still make a 15 cent profit.  Assumption #1 - they sold half their stores, so all else equal (assumption #2) - they would earn 7 or 8 cents this year from the remaining stores. Yes, it is a competitive business so its not that simple probably.  If RAD continued alone, after reducing their debtload by $4.3 billion with the cash they are getting, they would reduce their debt cost by about $250 million a year if the debt costs 6% a year.  If the debt they get rid of cost 8% then they save something like $350 million a year.  Being profitable, this $250k$350k  a year should drop down to the bottom and be worth 25 or 35 cents a share spread over 1 billion shares.  Minus taxes of ??    The result is earnings of 20 to 30 cents a share.  At a 16 multiple the stock should be worth $3 to $5 a share.  There is more to it than this for sure, but it seems like the merger value offered for RAD is too low.",
💩+💩=💩,
"I can't even get out at $2.15.. I guess the floor is set at $1.83 plus ""crumbs"" from Albertsons..",
Rite Aid was almost profitable before keeping better stores and losing millions in interest payments.  They could have easily hit $3.50 by this fall.Now we have been stabbed in the back?  How do we know Albertson's stock is any good?  They don't seem to be anything near Krogers.,
main problem is  why rush? After debt payment let the dust settle. If CEO says he has control over situation then RAD will do better. But if his intention is to scam shareholders he is just hopping like one greedy ba* and trying to make $$ while he can. He is willing to throw his own 12mill shares because he seems to try getting quick money,
why all the negative nancys with RAD we don't know the value of albertsons.   we do know healthcare and drugs will be huge profit machines forever at this point.while i did go against my better judgement and decide to be long when i told myself to.be shortthe RAD name could be worth much more than 2.5 per share.albertsons could be worth $50 a share.we don't know.all the math saying its' value is fuzzy at this point,
suneq to da moon!,

Instead of giving Walgreens real clout in all RiteAid locations to go head to head with CVS, we've got this shrunk down RAD with no hope of surviving.

I hate to say this I would rather lose all my money I have in RAD then to let Cerberus & RAD management get rich from me.RAD maybe in worse shape than we expect and end up going BK.

"So on October 27, 2015 a sophisticated buyer, Walgreen's, is willing to pay $9.00 a share cash, for RAD in a deal valued at $17.2 billion.  Now supposedly after lower performing stores were sold for cash, other operational improvements were made and future performance is expected to improve, the shares are worth only $2.50?  How was there a 72% value destruction?  Either Walgreen's had the world's worst due diligence team or the Cerberus private equity guys behind Albertsons worked a deal to enrich RAD's management and steal the company from the shareholders.  Walgreen's should either send a check for $billions to the FTC for saving them from a awful merger or the FTC should send RAD shareholders one for costing them billions.",
Anyone want to take a guess on where the floor should for the next couple of weeks if there's no additional news and the deal is static?.. In other words at what point would one step in and buy even if they don't like the recent deal?,
I wouldn't touch either one of them with a barge pole.,
I don’t want me a shareholder of an even more broken company with Standley at the helm to boot. Good bye and good riddance RAD.,
remember when RAD hit $9?pepperidge farms remembers,
So what's the floor for RAD in PPS with this deal has it stands.. Any reason for RAD to drop below $1.83 just as an example?..,
Hey this can be the next SUNE when it IPOs Albertsons down to the next BK down to zero.RAD management just like SUNE management destroyed company and shareholders.PE will only be around long enough to get special dividend for them and management leave the compamy high debt that they won't be able to pay.

About 20% potential gain is okay but not that great.3) Regulatory hurdles may be easier to overcome this time but it could take time and waiting will cost you money. 4) RAD management is incentivized to make the deal go through so Albertson's may lower the price  with time (as did Walgreens) and RAD may just take the crappier deal.",
Everything depends on what Albertson's shares are worth.  I think Albertson got a good deal as it will gain scale.  If the shares are indeed worth $2.50 - this is a good arbitrage opportunity.,
"All the way around, it sounds like a deal made at the top for those very few at the top.  It's easy to see America's greatness and to whom largess is applied.Think it's a fair system??  Even WBA got payola.",
Because there are not many buyers who want to tie up their money on a risky bet for the next six months. And they don't believe $2.50 for this combination ($25) is actually going to materialize....more like $15 to $20.  I suspect you will be able to change your mind and get back in closer to $2.,

In their last IPO effort investor effort is at $17/share vs expectation of $24. Albertsons Debt Raised by $3B in last 3 quarters.  What is rational for valuing Albertson at $25/share and coming to acquisition price at $2.5.  Based on Info actual valuation is between $1.3 to $2.5. with uncertainty we need to go with mid point which is $1.9 /RAD shareThe merger terms are not in the interest of RAD holders. So investors anger!!!,
"2.5 is a high end assumption using Albertson's multiple. The truth is no one wants to own this levered up company, with razor thin margins, no organic growth, and competitive threats all around. And that includes current PE shareholders that just want out. Then there is zero confidence in this moronic self serving CEO. This company could be a chapter 11 in 5 years or less. Dump it!",
I bought 4000 shares near the close yesterday at 2.03 a share. I tried to sell the 2.00 call for a couple weeks out for as low as 8 cents (3 of those cents in the money) and it did not fill.Woke up today and saw the chance to sell at 2.13....so I did.Even a blind squirrel....,
just sold all my shares. cant figure out what the hell is going on. if its a buy out at 2.5 and this is a low ball for sharegolders why the hell is stock not trading closer to 2.5. ????,
"I'm thinking there is enough B.S. on this whole topic to keep everyone entranced for the foreseeable future. I noticed there were no buyers and only sellers initially but that today we have more buyers. I think it argues for a $2 floor and a $2.25 ceiling. Anyone who can argue that we know what Albertson's is worth needs to bring it forward. What I think I know, is that Cerberus and company want to monetize asap and want RAD to help. The problem is that Albertson's may actually be worth less than RAD by the time this closes. Six months is a long time.....people getting older....Albertson's continuing lose market share. Unless you think that Walgreen's REALLY missed the boat.....it is possible that  RAD is viable with decent management. Why else would Walgreen's want RAD so badly.....enough to take their most marginal stores? In full disclosure; I'm leaning toward a no vote.",
"I'd hardly consider this deal to be the last nail in the coffin. I would have considered the amended deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. to have been game over with the cash payout. This deal while sub optimal, at least gives holders of Rite Aid Corporation a chance to stay in the game.",

Assuming that RAD in the $2 to $2.50 range has little downside, this merger should be rejected outright.  Hopefully, a shareholder rejection of the merger will be parlayed into removing Standley from the company entirely",

Is worth much more than the deal indicates, which only benefit Standley to get the fad bonus of 20 million and get a job which probably pays him more due to higher cap.  RAD longs won’t vote for this merger, but vote to oust  Standley and his crony board.  SEC should investigate this deal!",
"Obviously, the market doesn't think 1 share Albertsons = ~$23.",
"If this deal were $2.50 in cash, I'd probably vote yes.  Would rather get $3, but beggars can't be choosers.Problem is that 90+% of the value in this deal is in Albertstons shares.  Very questionable whether the combined Albertsons / Rite Aid is worth the $9+ Billion market cap assumed in the $2.50 valuation.  That risk significantly reduces the effective premium.  While it is highly unusual for the passive funds that own most of RAD shares to push back on a deal, this may be a case where they do, and the deal gets sweetened.  My pipe dream is $2 and a share of Albertsons for every 8 shares of RAD, or an implied value of $3.25.  Probably a pipe dream; but hopefully somewhere in between can happen.",

I personally, think that BHF's balance sheet is pretty solid and own a tiny bit of the stock. However, another life insurer, should have been included in the graphs above, NWLI.

I take Intels move to be a significant sign toshareholders that the right move was and is the move that I made and vote for Broadcom’s directors and acquisition of Qualcomm.  That is if you are interested as a shareholder in making a solid profit and long term investment in my opinion, and yes I realize and feel sorry for the many employees that will most likely lose their jobs from this consolidation and just hope that they too hold their QCOM shares and profit as well, but I still don’t feel sorry for Mgmt at QCOM that continues to sell stock at much lower levels and feathering their nests with bloated over paid salaries and BOD fees.  I know many of these employees say that these shares that they are selling is part of their salary and I say as a shareholder that it is entirely up to the employee to decide to sell or hold.

It's far from clear that they have any special ability to lead in that arena again, much less dominate 5G.Buying NXP (a so-so fab + hodge-podge of plebian design) seems like an inefficient vertical integration that will exclude access from world-class fabs of TSC, GF, etc.  The rationale behind the purchase is questionable ... even doubtful.Hopes that the Apple case will be  resolved soon are pure fantasy.  A well paid team of lawyers can keep that event over the event horizon for years.  That idea is should be resolved favorably is a  dice roll.Given high risks, and marginal recent past performance, the $79 offer is reasonable.  I *will* take that offer in a heartbeat and curse the QCOM board for piddling on $82 when on the table.A long-shot possibility remains, that Apple will stir the pot.  Push Broadcom out, stress QCOM (perhaps while it's debt has increased, or in court) and take it over at an even less attractive price, perhaps piece-wise.The main issue is that QCOM has failed to present a case to the market that it has *probable* (not just potential) growth path to justify a $79/shr or better valuation.  If they had made such a case effectively, then the share price woudn't be stuck around $65. I smell a lot of 'if' (risk) coming off their plans.",

Here's a nugget for you guys so confident in the deal:http://bit.ly/2sTLzp2,
"ramen:1) tondino was not acting as unselfishly as you imply.  He lives in his community while most other shareholders do not.  To some extent, he benefits when his community benefits.  Therefore, he wants to use other shareholders property in order to benefit himself and his neighbors at the expense of other shareholders.2)  Do you believe that free markets, competition, private property, and capitalism will achieve greater efficiency and greater wealth for the nation?  If you do, then managements of public companies should use shareholder property to pursue the best interests of all of their shareholders rather than their own selfish interests.  And profit maximization via competition in free markets should be the goal, not sacrifice of profits in pursuit of humanitarian service to some particular group.  Humanitarianism is properly pursued by charities where donations are sought without the false representation that the money is in pursuit of profit.",

"I render no opinion on the value of NXP.  But I reject the author's logic in asserting that the increase he expects in EPS after a merger will result in a higher QCOM share price.Suppose the author is correct that EPS will increase after a merger.  That does not necessarily mean that a higher QCOM share price will be justified.  Crucial to that determination is analysis of how much the net assets of the resulting QCOM will decline (calculated without adding a value for the NXP shares purchased).  After making that determination, then one should compare the expected increase in EPS to that decline in net asset value.  The effect of the merger on QCOM share price will depend upon how long it would take for the increased earnings to rebuild the net asset value to its pre-merger level.  For example, suppose the merger results in a net asset value reduction of $30.00 per share of QCOM (calculated without adding a value for the NXP shares purchased).  And suppose EPS increases because of the merger by $1.50 per year.  It would take about 20 years of the increased earnings to rebuild the net asset value of QCOM to its pre-merger level.  That is about a 5% return on investment which does not seem to me to justify any increased value to QCOM share price.",
No deal it seems. Lowering the offer Tan showed how over leveraged he actually was and reliant on cash that would come from Qcom after buyout. Any support from major shareholders he had is gone. Now it’s up to Qcom management to deliver.,
Those who are against the deal are claiming there is a path forward to AAPL royalty. While it is likely that AAPL may settle because that 2-3 B dollars/year may not be much compared with AAPL earnings. But QCOM has no way to force it. Court has not ruled to stop AAPL product shipments. Even if it gets settled no one knows what the terms would be. AAPL's long term goal is not to pay royalty to QCOM for each phone.,
"Market does not see QCOM earning 7.5 dollars in 2019. Then the shareprice cannot be 62 dollars. The debt of 30B+ for a company with marketcap of 90B is a risky proposition. In reality QCOM may end up having 40B debt. AVGO merger will make it even worse. AVGO is getting 60B debt to aquire QCOM. (When QCOM had 40B assets and 20B debt, it looked ok because the total company debt might be manageable)You are probably right the AVGO merger may not succeed just because of the debt management.",
"Yeah, I wouldn't be so quick to think this deal is going to go through.  Institutional investors are going to weigh the expected and highly credible EPS estimates of Qualcomm to a regulatory process that will most likely take more than 18 months.

"“Qualcomm Valuation suggests shareholders are better off waiting for EPS growth” statement is utter rubbish.  This is a complete con job statement that could only be used by a Mgmt. and BODs desperate to hold onto their cooshie overpaid jobs and positions.   Fact:  QCOM stock was trading at mid 50s level and spiked in price after Broadcom’s offer to more closely match their $72 offering price and with this bump up in value created solely by AVGO it has been greeted with continued selling by Mgmt. and BODs of QCOM stock at levels grossly beneath the $82 offering price or 22% lower while QCOM has the audacity to call AVGO’s offer insufficient and too low.  This selling is decidedly biased with net sells by officers and directors selling 166,958 shares and only buying 9,000 shares in last 12 months.  Hardly a vote of confidence.  I like to say ignore what they say and watch what they do, as actions speak louder than words and these actions of selling and not buying tells me that QCOM doesn’t believe the stuff they are shoveling.  Fact,  take Ole Mr. Alexander H. Rogers, officer V.P. And President Qualcomm licensing, he just sold QCOM stock at $68.20 that appears to leave him with only 10,403 shares of QCOM.  I think it is important to note that according to Morningstar the top 5 officers of QCOM earned an estimated $42,932,649 in compensation in 2016, which is an average of around $8,586,529 per executive, of course not all executives are paid equally with the CEO earning an estimated $11,066,012 in 2016 or almost $1 million a month.  They needed to sell stock?  I maybe simple, but if the average exec is making an average of $715,544 a month that they would be net buyers or at a minimum of holders of the stock if the future was so bright, but they aren’t and looking over the want ads, I can clearly see there aren’t many jobs that pay $715,544 a month if any.

"They are not really accusing of channel stuffing. they are accusing that the customer gets  billed only when they collect on their billing from the government. that is fraud.

I believe we will get answers tomorrow morning as MiMedx is holding another conference call.  They have been stanch defenders of their executive and business practices and I do not foresee this to be a reversal this time around either.,

"We'll see.  Company's do not typically delay earnings if there is nothing wrong.  This attack has been going on how long, and the company is just now re-looking at the financial practices?

"I agree with your review,  As a retired CPA, I believe this audit might be at the request of a 3rd party perhaps interested in acquiring MiMedx and wanting to ensure proper DD.  The timing of the audit is a bit strange.  It could/should have been done well before the release date of the FS.  I too came back in at $8.67 yesterday,",
Excellent analysis and spot on,
According to the Wall Street Journal MiMedx did also not Report doctors payments. Moreover the Company has engaged Independent legal and accounting advisors to conduct an internal Investigation about accounting practices. This will take months meaning that until then no financials will be released.,

The bet here is on nuts, particularly walnuts and pecans, which are part of ever-increasingly health-conscious consumer's diet. Comparing all the snack food companies in the above valuation chart, JBSS is by far the healthier product mix overall. Lance Crackers and walnuts may both be snack foods, but I think future demographics will favor nuts over peanut butter and crackers.",
"Don't they deserve to trade at a sizable discount to peers that have actual brand equity? I don't think anyone is buying nuts because they are branded with the Fisher name. IMO nuts, especially the recipe nuts that Fisher specializes in, have more in common with commodities than they do with the traditional snack foods formula of very cheap ingredients + strong brand equity (Oreo, Twinkie, etc).",

"Alessandro, you and I have agreed in the past that we should be very skeptical of the cool aid coming from the corporate office, the big benefits of the Alstom acquisition, the seemingly bad timing of doubling down on oil and gas, the pay back to GE stockholders of the stock buy backs, etc., but you must admit that we were in a minority, even of the SA authors. I also believe we, stockholders, didn’t demand more detailed execution plans. I have been requesting transparency in the marginal revenue and income of Alstom in 2016 and 2017. I also have been asking for the comprehensive plan and organization responsible for the proposed 12B revenue growth of the IofT effort by 2020. I have indicated that Additive manufacturing has some possibilities, but am confused by the intent of the current management’s business plans in this area.  lastly, I have considered the rationale that legacy businesses in which GE has great name recognition and large fielded base should be sold because they are not core to be bogus and rationalization by incompetent managers and portfolio managers who have little or no operational management experience, As a more pertinent comment to your suggestion about Buffett buying GE, it seems to me that his philosophy is to buy well run companies or to put qualified managers in place and then let them run their  companies including determining their need and use of discretionary resources. Not exactly the model or the state of affairs currently extant in GE.",

"Speaking of when will the price be right, I was just looking at a couple of charts...since the beginning of February, while GE is still in distribution mode and the price has dropped, the money flow into the stock is increasing. I could be wrong, but that says to me that the stock is moving from weak hands...influenced by the torrent of bearish articles and comments...into stronger hands who know value when they see it.As for Buffett, he will be on CNBC Monday at 6 a.m....when he talked previously on CNBC about GE the price was at $18...this doesn't mean he is or will be buying soon--and on Monday he certainly won't be saying he is a buyer even if he is one--but it does mean that it has moved further in the right direction for value investors, whether it be Buffett or anyone else.

"As a long suffering stockholder of GE, I hope Buffett doesn’t buy GE. I have yet to see a deal that Buffett has completed that was beneficial for the current stockholders. I know he lent GE money that was crucial at the time of the 2008 debacle, but it was a sweetheart deal. He knew his money was not at risk, due to his connections to the Obama administration which deemed GE too big to fail. Other shareholders could never get that sweetheart deal. Instead of the Buffett buying the scenario, it would be nice to read a deep dive analysis of what impact the Alstom acquisition has had, what are the problems and how are they being addressed. It would similarly be useful to know the same about the BHI merger. I keep thinking that looking at past financials is well and good and projecting their future results from the past references is one line of analysis. Of course if these reports are neither accurate or intentionally muddled to hide problems that is serious. A neglected line of analysis is to define what are the problems in power in enough detail and what can be done to overcome them for example. I personally think that if this insight was demanded by the financial and outside analysts of the previous management, what were the details of the Alstom   integration, what cost synergies were accomplished as a function of time and what concrete milestones did management establish that could be tracked internally and externally, the so called surprise wouldn’t have occurred. I believe the community accepted too readily the potential business growth of .GE digital, IofT, the wondrous  synergy of Alstom, the doubling down on oil and gas, the wondrous usefulness of the GE store, the great utility of a far flung set of GE R&D centers disjointed from the near term needs of the operating businesses, the wisdom of Stick buy backs in the face of incresing underfunding of pensions and a looming cash flow problem and never demanded detailed execution plans from a CEO who was great at marketing the community and not much else. Now, the community is damning that management but still isn’t demanding those detailed execution plans. Cost cutting and selling assets doesn’t do it for me.",

"AlessandroDo you have any thoughts on the positive impact on GE Aviation and the CFM joint venture regarding the problems with the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engine?I think CFM and P&W are the two options for the a320 neo.

Embraer and Mitsubishi have also designated the GTF engine for their new regional planes.CFM and GE may have an opportunity to boost sales much higher than the 10% of a320's that are receiving the GTF.There has been so much bad news coming from GE that I wonder how the market may react or even overreact to a projection of an extra 1000 or 2000 engine sales.So far this has only been discussed in the context of a320's.  I believe the bigger story is the planes that are using the P&W GTF exclusively.  If the problems persist, these companies will need to quickly replace suppliers.Pratt and Whitney continues to announce fixes but as recently as february 9, 2018 Airbus was forced to put additional restrictions on the planes with GTF engines.  P&W refers to the issues as teething problems.  It seems that things are running deeper than that.",

I think young female should be right for Warren Buffett,
"Let’s think what has to play out yet. GE will have to hire a forensic accounting firm, and restate years of financial. There will be the law firms signing up shareholders. Eventually they will be consolidated into one class action. Then you have the known and unknown future liabilities. As bad as GE has been, the blood really isn’t in the streets yet.

Have no idea if the Oracle shorted GE but if even I can see the profit in doing so how could he have missed it?  Have to remember something about companies that issue warrants to survive.... over 30% go BK!  Told my broker to monitor Omaha and if that locale should again make a move on GE to sell my shorts and buy GE...IMMEDIATELY!  The major problem with GE is the murky conditions of their liabilities.  If any one in the world can give an exact number on GE liability it would be Buffet.  There is no way Buffet gave GE that much money with out having done (as Flannery likes to say) ""A Deep Dive"".  Agree with Author in that I think Buffet is a main buyer of select assets or waits until the fire sale is over and can pick up the core he wants after the excess baggage is sold off.

You have to worry about a GE turnaround when their SVP of Business Transformation (Daniel Janki ) has been with them since 1992.How transformative is he really going to be at this point of his career and when he is so steeped in the current GE culture?,
Warren buffet is just waiting for another chance to “endorse” GE and charge them some exorbitant rate.  Just like he did last time.  Management is so stupid and lazy they’d rather do another disastrous deal with buffet than do their jobs.  Still I think $12.50-13 might be a good place to buy.  Earnings should come in around $1.  So at that price with nearly a 4% dividend it’s a decent investment I think.,
AlessandroI don't see Buffett making any moves on GE unless yield is 6%+ and debt is much lower which implies a much lower stock price,
Anti trust anyone? This one wont be as clear as anything he has done before.  I see overlap on the capital side (SIFI again?) and offourse precision and the railway business.

"There are more skeletons hidden in the GE basement.    WSJ savaged GE today, which will only put more pressure for serious re-structuring.

I remember reading comments last Fall when GE was trading at $18 - $19, that it would never fall below $15...  All the GE fanboys 'guaranteed it';    I sold short...     Guess what, it's going below $12, and the dividend is going to be cut again.   The whole BOD should be fired; Immelt's pension $ and payouts should be clawed back and let him choke on the $8M of GE stock he bought last year at $30/sh...

"i am sure that Warren is interested providing he gets the right deal. However, it is not a deal that will do most GE holders any good.

I'm not sure dangling this 'hope' out to other GE current / prospective investors does them a great service.",
"Most companies that Buffett acquired outright had a big moat and competent honest management.

As long a significant activist investors have a say in GE's future... I think Mr. Buffet will wait it out.,
"Nice to know everyone agrees GE is not a buy. I also notice the WSJ doubles down on Barron's panning of GE...must be the thing to do these days, though it does look as if the bears are not having the effect on the price that they desire.This also would explain why Buffett is expressing interest in GE and why other investors have already started buying into the stock. So...wait till it reaches 10 and you will be trying to jump on the bandwagon when it breaks over 16...by then the WSJ and Barron's ""experts"" will be telling you it is fashionable to sing GE's praises.",
"Too many shares are outstanding for Buffet along with GE Capital having a small intrinsic value. Buffet likes markets leaders, and that's mostly GE Aviation. In reality, Buffet is slipping a bit and won't bite, but he does like history, thus why he kept IBM for so long. I unfortunately bought in the $17's, this after I placed a $12 target on the stock. After it ran up to $19, I thought $17 was an okay price; now I'm concerned about my $12 price target coming to fruition. I believe GE will do some major layoffs and sell the unprofitable businesses, thus becoming leaner. Even though management guided to the low end of earnings, we will see what creative write-offs and distribution of assets they will come up with. By no means do I think GE will hit $30 in 2018, but $20, after a couple quarters of positive momentum isn't absurd. Once they get their act together, and increase/normalize dividends, then the stock will 100% follow. But until then, especially with an overall market correction doomed to hit, it's going to be a ride.",
Nice title and thesis.  If BRK buys - price will skyrocket up.  Seems - the BRK team is not afraid of debt.  General Statements -> Price does not equal Value.  GE is trading at a 7 year low.  GE should be around in 10 years and could be priced higher than current.  I hope to live to see this play out.,

"Yeah, it seems like they could have also spun the two ag pieces and let them decide if they want to combine or not.  Benefits would still accrue to the eventual shareholders.  Perhaps doing it this way helped prop up the remnant pieces a bit.  The assumption is that there is a benefit from combining the two ag pieces from reducing competition (perhaps from cost synergy also).",
"Until someone can explain to me why it makes sense to split into 3 companies right after merging .. it must be some kind of accounting thing. I can understand maybe splitting out the agricultural business from DWDP but I have yet to understand the point of merging only to split up again even further. I am long DWPD so I'd love to understand it. I'm just starting to question the reasoning at this point and it worries me. Maybe there's a very good reason for it. If it were me, equipped with my extremely limited knowledge of the financial reasons behind this ""merge-triple spin off"" (didn't they already spin off Chemours, too?) I'd probably split off the agricultural business and otherwise keep DWDP together. I'm just confused.Your title has it right.",
"For legacy Dow I can understand that worry. For ag, I see them making acquisitions given that industry is consolidating, but I'm sure they will be in the ag space - maybe new product lines or geographies, but nothing that raises an eyebrow.

You don't use a premium-for-control multiple to compute a trading multiple.  I also agree that underfunded pension liabilities cannot be ignored, and comps used should also include underfunded pension liabs for adjusted EV multiples that are used.Despite the above three items, you've done a useful exercise that begins to show DWDP has upside once the market appropriately values the pieces.",

Then it would not be to much to ask for a 3% dividend.,
"Let me start by saying that DoDuPont is my firm's biggest position. But Ben, do you honestly believe that this has an upside of 50%?This all looks great on paper, but the biggest piece flying off is MatCo, a cyclical commodity business that is close to cyclical peaks. Should the ethylene cycle roll over that EBITDA goes away, margins are compressed and poof there goes that upside! And that is before even getting into Ag and SpecCo.I think it is extraordinarily unreasonable to include FMC and Albermarle into your comps for MatCo. Both of these are benefiting from the boom in lithium and are valued as such. FMC has 87% of revenues coming from ag and 13% of revenues from lithium. Zero ethylene exposure. How is that even a comp for MatCo? Same question for Westlake. Same question for Albemarle. Same question for Kronos. I would think the wide disparity in multiples should clue you into that. So lets remove all those and now you get an average multiple of 9.6x EBITDA and poof goes $30B of value. Of course, your math is also wrong for MatCo. 9,101 of EBITDA * 13.05 = 118,768 EV. Less 16,080 of debt = 102,688. Now applying the appropriate multiple of 10x for Matco (as you briefly highlight at the end) and you now get a value of 71,900. That wipes out $30B of value and now you only have 30% upside. And that is assuming that the EBITDA numbers are correct and your ""multiples"" are correct.",

You should realize by now that a 1.3B estimate by 2022 is extremely off considering revenue estimates are at 980m by 2020.. I'm comfortable to say because we had a strong 8 month launch, that the peak penetration of 10%(60k) is highly achievable or 4.5B in annual sales. That is from TD indication alone and doesn't include ROW, OTC, or other indication sales.. Ingrezza is very likely be a 5b+ annual selling drug from indications in TD/TS and other movement disorders/2mm+. Secondly.. zacks projects elagolix for ENDO to do 1.5B and for UFE to do 2.6B.. thats still a 4.1B estimate for elagolix which is CONSERVATIVE.. i'm not sure why you aren't including other analyst estimates that have projected elagolix to do over 5b in peak sales..Currently NBIX NPV is well below its true value. it makes no sense at all for it to be trading below $135 PPS.",
the only traders in this stock are the shorts and I love it as they all have come along for the ride from $55. institution ownership is 108% of the shares outstanding and 1105 of the float. The institutions own the short position shares.  There are no retail shares to exploit. the two larger drops in stock price have been market driven not sector or NBIX driven and that says a lot.  On the 2 sell off down to high mid seventies the stock has rebounded very quickly to the mid eighties.  I suppose some traders will try and channel trade the stock because they are just that traders looking to make a fast buck.NBIX own's  100% of Ingrezza  and the royalty rates on Elagolix are between 22/24% of top line sales.  Teva did a marketing analysis on TD and they came up with a severe TD patient population of in the U.S. of 600K patients by the end of 2018.  NBIX charges around 60K per year per patient. so at 20% penetration rate  you have a $2.3B peak sales blockbuster. The roll out via the early sales numbers is showing early on just how big Ingrezza is going to be.,

"Innovative InvestorHere is what you miss.  Here is what every institutional investor misses.  Here is what the last many article contributors have missed and will continue to miss.  The company has been terribly mismanaged for over 17 years.  Unlike most, who make this comment because of ""sour grapes"" over the dwindling stock price, my comments are based on the knowledge that few IF ANY observers really appreciate.  Namely, when you visit the amount of stores I have over the years and you see gross mismanagement of the scale I have seen, and you continually notify the board, and the board looks the other way, the problem has less to do with the inability to compete and more to do with malfeasance.  Malfeasance can be corrected, having zero to do with competition constraints.I am NOT talking about just visiting my local stores; I have NONE in Florida.  I am talking about visiting RAD stores across the country, up until 2015.  I am talking about having to notify the SEC on several occasions to stop unethical activities of the board of directors.  I am talking about Mr. Standley ""not minding the store"" ever since 2012 when he ""officially"" became Chairman/CEO and immediately since then had this company in a constant state of play, to sell it, to accelerate the stock options for himself, as well as him being on numerous outside boards.  Did someone forget to tell him that being a ""good"" CEO is a full job and 1/2, plus Chairman another 1/2 job?  I am talking about the team of Miller, Sammons AND Standley from 2000-2005 and beyond running the store base into the ground.  That is what my eyes saw, over and over again.  AND nothing but lethargy in making timely corrections, if at all, losing customers, some forever, every step of the way.It is ironic indeed, that Robert Miller head of Albertson's, prior Chairman/CEO at Rite Aid would now reappear to make this lowball offer, WHO STANDLEY REPORTED TO DIRECTLY when they were at RAD from 2000-2005.  It was Miller who tapped Sammons to replace him, who in turn continued to deteriorate the EXPANDED store base when they doubled their debt to purchase Eckerd in 2007, and whose stores are likely a high percentage of the stores Walgreens bought now.  And it was Miller, together with the rest of the board, that allowed Sammons to linger for an additional 4 years at RAD, even though they had determined that Sammons was not performing.  That is NOT a guess on my part, it was the words out of the  mouth of another then current director.  So, Miller has not performed, Sammons has not performed and Standley ever since 2012 was too busy trying to make ""accelerated options"" windfalls for himself.  And that was just fine for our board, who make sure they got in on the action for themselves likewise, by giving themselves huge financial raises at a time the stock was languising under $1, DUE TO THEIR OWN BAD DECISIONS!So, Innovative Investor, our board that has never had an election contest, always running unopposed, needed a good kick in the pants to meet their fiduciary responsibilities to their shareholders, which never happened.  They have not been competitive, because they are mismanaged; I could write a book on it, because I know.  Let's hope that another alternative pops up now, but if it does, the first order of business would be to remove the board and to let Standley work somewhere else, where they do not mind that he not put in a full day of work for his shareholders, instead of scheming how to make tens of millions of dollars for himself at the expense of his shareholders.",

"According to the small study (162 participants), as noted, there was essentially no difference between reported focal seizure reduction in the drug arm.  However, what is striking, is the very high 'placebo' effect.  something just doesnt seem right.    If the study had been to look at a subjective result (such as headache, pain control) rather than an objective effect (noticeable seizure), one could expect such a high effect in the control group.  But 40% seems unrealistic. I suspect something was in error in the study itself, not necessarily that the drug was totally ineffective.",
"Buying or holding the stock is a different question, because there are many others drugs in their pipeline. But I totally disagree with Bob on this. Not a type 2 error. We have to prove that a reduction happened, not that it didn't. The fact that a placebo produced the same effect means that the drug's result is entirely explained in this test by a psychological effect. The drug produced no effect here above that of a sugar pill. Nobody should think ""the drug's reduction is real but the placebo's result places it in some doubt."" Wrong. There was no effect proven to happen in this test. That is what ""no significance"" means. If we want to be good analysts, we cant secretly harbor a belief that it works before evidence is in. If the placebo result had been 30% reduction, versus 40% for the drug, then we could say there is evidence of 10% reduction above placebo. But the placebo is equal to the drug result. So no evidence of reduction happened here above the psychological effect. Later tests may produce different results, and we can all hope for different results then, but it is wrong to think otherwise for this test. Sorry to be repetitive. Good discussion.

If they are sitting on more significant data then that they need to recompile and present more asap.None of my opinions are scientifically based obviously but I don’t see the conviction.",
Terms “preserves muscle function “ and “substantially slowed dmd disease progression” can be extremely subjective in the pharmaceutical realm. These terms can be bate for the unknowing only to be toned down 100x when it’s time deliver.,
Well I’m going to think of maxing out what I can borrow before I consider the other two options of partnering or diluting. Seems as though trade wars will drive more investors to immune investments and if this drug “substantially decreases the effects of the disease and preserves muscle function “ then management needs to be more clever. Stalling  phase 3 this long seems concerneing no matter what angle you’re looking at,
"To me it's simple. If they can't find a partner and need to dilute, that tells you all you need to know about this data. Why wouldn't BP bet $30M to get a $1 billion drug? They would if the odds were ~1 in 30. So no partner means these odds are ridiculously lower than even that. The market knows what dilution means if this happens and dilution takes this back to $1. So be long if you think a partner is coming. If you're wrong, shares will take a 50% haircut. If you're not sure, buy half now and half after we find out where their funding is coming from.",
"Although the author did not mention it in this article, I actually like the fact that CATB has a SMART LINK technology platform (linking two molecules that may have synergistic effect in one drug) that could potentially generate more interesting product candidates down the road.CATB has been tight lipped about their pipeline candidates: - edasalonexent in Phase 1 studies for other rare diseases- CAT-4001 in pre-clinical studies for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Friedreich's ataxia",

So why is trading where it is and not with a market cap of $500M? for many a reason I suppose. All eyes have been on dystrophin enhancing eteplirsen; big institutions can’t buy a $2.00 stock (remember Srpt did a 6 to 1 reverse split for a reason); because they are measured only against the immediate effect of an steroid (yet at least a third of population can’t take steroids due to horrendous side effects).

I lke that they focus on the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutic products based on safely metabolized and rationally targeted , the so called (SMART) linker drug discovery platform in the U.S.A., and I usually like companies based in Cambridge. :-) Besides Edasalonexent, an oral small molecule, which is in PI/II l for the treatment o muscular DMD, they also have  CAT-5571 for CF conductance regulator, as well as for the clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  CAT-4001 for the treatment of severe and rare neurodegenerative diseases, such as Friedreich's ataxia and AMLS.In 2016 they had some agreements with SRPT about a joint reserach on DMD, and there is always the possibility that SRPT may buy CATB, :-)http://bit.ly/2BHkND8The institutions have been buying in spite of CATB's continued  increase on losses and future need to raise cash in order to conduct its planned PIII of Edasalonexent on DMD, and the analysts consensus  ""target"" is around $4.50 somewhat lower than the  targets a couple of years ago, which were all above $20 :-)CATB opened up today, maybe with the help of this article :-)And is still trading up 1.95% at present at $1.57 and was up at $1.59 earlier.But it is still down 1.87% for the week and it needs to close above 2.70 before I would consider buying back  some of the the shares I sold, since I always like to buy on the way up, with a close trailing stop loss. :-)http://bit.ly/2BIRC2gBernard",
Yes Sarepta is not a competitor. They would actually be taken together. Catabasis drug has virtually no side effects so all it has to do it show it can replace steroid treatment.Also I wouldn’t be too nervous about a dilutive offering to raise cash.

"Repeat after me.... Sarepta is NOT a competitor to Catabasis. Also, patients currently on etep would take edasa in addition to etep in the phase 3. Catabasis currently has ~6 month data on a patient or two from the OLE taking a combo etep/edasa. So that bodes well that the drugs are having a complementary impact, as one would expect based on the preclinical data.",
Debt financing wouldn't be a bad thing if it doesn't contain excessive warrants or bad terms on convertibles..,
"Like CATB at this price and the piece is correct that they can treat all DMD patients. That said, it will not likely be a solo therapy. Either PMO or PPMO will provide the foundation. With some luck, Gene Therapy will play a role. CATB has a ways to go! While the recent data is “positive”, keep in mind that the data is from an extension of their failed Phase 2 trial. It should inform the design of their P3. Time will tell. Without cash, they need a deal or a buyer.",

"I also agree that CAT-1004 may have great potential, but I disagree with some of the author's arguments. Catabasis has a drug that is treating the effects of Duchenne by finding ways to interfere with the paths that cause muscle breakdown, while Sarepta is trying to correct the underlying genetic defect. These companies are NOT competitors. In 2016 they agreed to work together to come up with a combination therapy to enhance treatment of DMD. It is a great WIN for both companies if each are successful, and Sarepta has many other exon skipping products in the pipeline to address the rest of the DMD patients. The author leads us to believe that CAT-1004 is a replacement for Sarepta's drug eteplirsen, and that is simply not the case. Good luck to Catabasis and good luck to Sarepta to finding ways to stop this horrible disease in its path.",

As we have seen in Colorado, three or fours years into recreational legalization the price of marijuana starts to drop as massive scales begin to drive down prices.LICENSED CAPACITY (as of February 16, 2018):Canopy: 20,650 KGOrganigram: 16,500 KG Aurora: 8,800 KGAphria: 9,000 KGMedReleaf: 12,600 KGOf course, all the big players, except for Canopy, will point to early 2019 as when they are anticipated to finish building their massive grow operations. To believe that these dates are attainable, one would have to dismiss the thought of construction delays, permit delays, inspection delays or weather delays. Its not easy to build in the winter in Canada. Even if they are able to overcome these obstacles, what we are left with is waiting for Health Canada to approve these facilities for licensed capacity. It has taken Health Canada, on average, at least two months to license a facility that sends in their application and videos for expansion approval. So, if all the big players, except Canopy, are able to get their applications and videos into Health Canada by January 1,2019, that means that they will be licensed to grow by March 1,2019.After the companies are licensed to grow, then they will start to plant their crops to harvest in 3-4 months. So, we are looking at around June 15, 2019 before these big players are bringing in these massive quantities into the market. Estimating that the recreational market is up and running on August 15, 2018, that means it will be 10 months before any of the large players are able to bring scale to the market, except for Canopy. What does the first mover advantage bring to the table?

"Bolt sales may begin to falter soon.  Hyundai, Kia and the 2019 Nissan Leaf (220 miles) will soon be available.  The Bolt, Hyundai, Kia and Nissan EV's will be in competition with each other, not Tesla.  So far, the Tesla Model 3 has no competition, on the road or on the drawing board.  The iPace by Jaguar, could truly compete with Tesla Model X, but doesn't competition lead to innovation.  I'm so looking forward to the next 5 years of EV development from all car companies, because these new EV models will compete, along side Tesla, with ICE vehicles for market share and by then, the trend toward EV adoption will be clear to everyone.  And lest we forget, that trend was initiated by Tesla.  I currently drive an Infinity FX35.  I purchased it 10 years ago for the style and performance it offered.  The next vehicle I purchase will be an EV, offering style and performance.  The Jaguar iPace could be a top contender, but I will wait to see what the Tesla Model Y or an updated Model X will offer by way of style and performance before I act.

But they share a common feature called long-range BEV... which is enough to make some comparisons as they are the only two of their kind (outside more expensive Model S/X) currently available, and soon the leaf 2 but with lower range (and lower price).Tesla is indeed superior in the design of their car, probably not on manufacturing. They aim also the right market for early EV adopters, so they aim also for higher sales than the Bolt. Anyway, thinking that competitors can't eat market share from Tesla is a blind attitude.",
"I have a sense that the reason Tesla ""accelerated"" the M3 was precisely because they wanted to try to capture a dominant share of the market (or at least what appeared to be a dominant share) before many other models appeared - they figured that if they could get lots of people leasing M3s those enthusiasts would not be available for competitors launching later.That is not a dumb strategy; particularly if your specs appear better than the competitors who are coming later.  Once those people are making payments to you, well, they will have high costs to switch their lease before it runs out.  This might really limit demand for competitors, particularly if you think that most buyers of EVs will be enthusiasts before 2022 or so (whenever your forecast is for price / cost parity).So, possibly the ramp issues with the M3, which I believe are fixable, will come too late as we get closer to the launch of competitive products.  Possibly.  Lots of variables that are quite  hard to estimate.",

"Bloomberg's current estimate for the Model 3 works out to 54,704 per year even if Tesla doesn't ramp up the tiniest bit. GM sold 1177 Bolts in January. At that rate, they would sell 14,124 cars per year, but to give them the benefit of the doubt, let's look at their best month ever. 3227 was their peak. If they did that every single month for a year, that would be 38,724. Tesla is already 41% ahead of that.Your own graph shows an exponential increase in ramp up, and extrapolates to Tesla beating the goal if you want to go by the rate shown by Bloomberg. SA has been saying for years that demand for the Model S and Model X is drying up. As of now, the waiting list for an S or X is up to five months. New US inventory for the S and X are one and zero respectively nationwide. Even used inventory is next to nothing with 4 for the X. For the S, it's a fraction of a day's production with most states having none.  Not only are Model 3 reservations rising, so are reservations for any Tesla. GM doesn't even make a comparable small sedan on the EV platform. The Bolt might be on the same platform as the Model Y, but it's too early to tell and demand for the Model Y is expected to be many times stronger than it is for the Model 3.  The so-called competitors don't exist yet. When they do, they will compete with future versions of the Model 3, which are already sold out. You may like to pick and choose numbers, picking a production volume for the Bolt that GM has achieved only once and despite no evidence that they will be able to do it again. But the latest sales numbers from GM show the opposite. I already see many times more Model 3s on the road than Bolts.  When GM had been selling Bolts to the general public as long as Tesla has been selling Model 3s, GM was selling 952 per month. So if you want to play that game, you should be comparing 11,424 for GM to 54,704 for Tesla if anybody were to believe that neither would ramp up.",
"As usual, Tesla hypesters take promises, revised forecasts, extrapolations, and hoped-for miracles all as current facts to prove their own wisdom and the rest of us's stunted evolvement.For two examples, they conflate ""demand"" with mere interest.  Someone who lays $1,000 down on a future car may plan to buy it, but need not pay whatever its price after however long a wait no matter its reputation with earlier buyers.  Perhaps in dim recognition of this, someone lately ballyhooed not the number of Tesla depositors but the total of cash deposited---$600 million, from some murky source.  At a guess, one-third of that is for the Roadster that does not exist and cannot be built until the Model 3 mess is over and done with, if ever. Also, someone posted graphs showing Tesla's ""exponential [what else?]"" growth in revenue from 2014 to '17 contrasted with GM and Ford's rather stagnant trend at only 12 to 14 times Tesla's top figure.  Naturally the graphs showed not profit or revenue contrasted with costs---only revenue.  Given how few cars Tesla has sold compared to the Big Two, that inflow can only have come from stock issues, presumably to investors who expect others behind them to pay even more per share year after year.  It was also touted that Tesla has sold $500 million in bonds this year or last, as if the proceeds were profits to be reinvested rather than loans to be repaid with interest (like earlier bonds maturing this year).  This will be an interesting year.  It already is.",

The new Roadster is supposed to have a 600+ mile range with a 200kWh battery, how will the Owl compare to that?

"Electric cars are an interesting niche case for automobiles right now. Due to a relative lack of options, someone might be convinced that the Model 3 has no competition strictly from the performance aspect. That may be true if performance alone is considered, however EV car buyers will like other car buyers buy for a variety of different reasons that may be mutually exclusive in the presence of more varied options. I would argue that the largest contingents of EV car buyers fall into primarily two camps: Camp 1 is concerned about being green. They are less price sensitive so are willing to open their wallets a little more if there's an option they see as green. Camp 2 is concerned about cost. A $35k EV car like a Model 3 may appeal, but only if they can capture that $7500 tax credit and any other local state tax credits. The much smaller contingent in Camp 3 wants performance, just like with ICE cars. Tesla wants you to believe that everyone cares about 0-60 times but that is clearly not the case. They also hamstring themselves with Camp 1 with these performance issues in that to be really green contender, a package that lends to quick 0-60 times isn't really a green option in any form of propulsion.... it is a wasteful luxury at the worst case, an unnecessary luxury at the best.Camp 1 and 2 can easily be dissuaded from Model 3 to other options as they also tend to align with more utilitarian transportation like a Bolt or Leaf.",

"Hey John, Great article but I think people are putting to much faith into Bloomberg's estimate production tracker. I believe it is showing more Model 3s than Tesla is currently producing and so when February numbers come out on March 1st/2nd we will see Tesla is still way behind where they should be. The Model S/X are currently not doing great like you and others have pointed out. Of course you have Fred from electrek.co claiming that the reason there are delays in Model X and S deliveries is because there is such a high demand that it is creating a backlog which makes absolutely no sense. Tesla for more than a year was producing more Model S/X than they were selling each quarter causing them to have an inventory that many believed were in the 10,000 range. So Tesla has no problem ramping up production to at least make 25,000 Model S/X a quarter. So there is more to this delay than what is being told to the public. Since last summer I have said that 2018 will be Tesla's make it or break it year and the  reason why is because we are seeing not only ramp in production of cars that came out in 2017 but also many new EVs being introduced in  2018 which is not good for a company that only sells 3 different products but also cannot ramp up production like its competition.

"Bret -- Staying diversified is a good idea.  Many fund managers and subject matter experts have initial success with a particular sector but then suffer mightily when it turns the other way.  For example, Brad Thomas is respected as a REIT industry writer and analyst, but I don't see his recommendations broadly holding up as of late.  There is a reason why three-legged stools are more popular than one-legged.I agree with your overall conclusion on WLH, but see tax effects differently.  WLH has tax loss carryforwards which it hopes to use to offset future income.  Those carryforwards had more book value at higher tax rates, thus the write down last quarter.  In effect, WLH will only see direct benefit from lower tax rates when carryforwards are exhausted, whenever that happens.I also want to bring up indirect effects of tax reform and homebuilders in general.  You've probably seen some call out lower mortgage interest deductions as an industry headwind.  They worry because lower caps apply, and deductions for interest paid on a secondary residence have been outright eliminated.  That affects buyers of all stripes including those who might consider a condo or other alternative to single family construction.  It is also a very narrow view toward housing affordability.Big picture, lower overall tax rates, higher standard deductions, and elimination of AMT for all but a few mean that most filers have lower tax burden and hence more cash available for discretionary purchases, including houses.  Some adjustments are inevitable, and I would not be surprised if tax reform and rent vs. own calcs drive some people to rent homes instead of buy, but someplace has to be home.  Overall demand should remain intact, and builders catering to the rental market may even benefit and find new business opportunities.The strong economy and overall tax reform stimulus are tailwinds for homebuilders, and WLH + RSI operate in geographies that should see better than average benefit.  I see a return to the $30's coming soon.-- do your due diligence",

Unless you have money to gamble (and i seriously mean GAMBLE) stay away from offshore drillers, and even if you are inclined to gamble you might as well just go to the casino, at least then you'll win or lose quickly instead of going sideways for years.",
Certainly anything is possible but ESV future is not in its hands. They like all the OSD sector are service companies that own nothing and make nothing. They provide a service and if that service is not needed they wither on the vine. We are in new territory on oil as new tech has brought new techniques to recover oil. Will this advance  is anyone's guess.  If you look at Nat Gas its has bumbled along at a lower for longer since 2010 and it has no forecast to climb anytime soon. Could oil follow this path certainly but again a unknown. What is know we remain in a fake manipulated market by OPEC/NOPEC. Its reasonable to deduct if OPEC announced today the cut ends at the end of the week oil prices fall and fall hard. I see no sense in counting or forecasting gains until the market can stand on its own which we are a ways off of that.,

I don't like to sell at such losses. If i buy now and it doubles then at least I can still have the same NE for ever (?) but at a much reduced cost.Any thoughts?",

What's your take on the recent Fleet status report out yesterday?,
"I think the idea of a doubling really undersells the possibilities here.  A case for a 3-5x sometime during a 5-year holding period can quite plausibly be made.  In contradiction to what the author says, however, it's not at all obvious that the excess supply issue has been worked out (cf. current day-rates and the actual utilization rates themselves, relative to history).  The supply problem being resolved and continued strength in the price of oil are the most obvious ways to get to that 3-5x (or possibly more) scenario.",
"The huge gap between the oil price movement and ESV's stock is the biggest/widest over the last 5 years. Something's gotta give, and I have a strong educated guess it'll be ESV's stock the one to close some of that gap.",

"Mr. Shvartsman:Haven't listened to the podcast yet, but I take issue with your opening line: ""It's a given that Chipotle burritos are good.""There are plenty better than CMG's rice bombs with the quarter cup of grizzled meat.  If you're with the NYC SA team, I''ll be happy to buy you lunch and introduce you to much better - and much more authentic - alternatives.  Just HMU in a PM.Cheers.",
"Daniel, I am really not sure if the effort you’ve put into your podcast is a value or not. You’re talking about general psychological effects which are in common part of the stock market and in particular to individual stocks. This stands in context to the modern efficient market theory. For sure you can use Chipotle to describe these effects but this happens to all others as well. The biases are one reason why markets are not efficient – as long as not KI took over. Beside your value view based on p/e multiple you don’t take into consideration the technical aspect on this stock. The stock rise is backed with unusual high volume after the CEO announcement. As Graham said: “In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” The future will tell who is right. But for now, the chart with its backed volume tells a different story. Thx for your podcast.",
Accounting was set up by MCD.  It is impossible that CMG's cost of food and packaging is 34%Two burritos are selling together with one soda on average. Cost of soda and cup is 18-20% of retail price - and it absolutely known to everyone. If one with the half brain is capable of excluding  soda sales/profits then cost of food/paper alone  is obvious 40%. They mark up costs to manipulate top line and SSS rates and they have no way out of this accounting.,
"I have stated before the only chance CMG has is  if Nicol fires everyone that Ells hired and Ells himself is made to leave. This arrogant team just stood by telling the public everything was ok, no need to change anything while the stock and CMG's reputation plunged. It was then later revealed Ells and company were warned well in advance (with reports of sickness) that their complicated supply chain and in restaurant raw  prep process (with teens and college kids handling raw food) had much more risk versus other restaurant concepts. Management arrogantly chose to ignore those warnings until it was too late.  I am predicting that if management is allowed to stay, this bump in price with the new CEO will most likely be seen in future quarters as a selling opportunity at the top of the range rather than a time you should have bought the stock.",
"Great discussion. I like Chipotle's product, but I try not to let that infect my analysis. We all have different tastes when it comes to food, so I try to consult objective surveys conducted by credible organizations. As to the company's prospects, I will admit that I was wrong in my initial assessment that the company would bounce back quickly. I am starting to think that one of the real issues is Chipotle's inattention to mass marketing, which is remarkable for a company of its size. The new CEO seems to have some experience on that front, though, and I think that this issue is fixable.  To paraphrase someone I spoke to recently, ""I used to go there all the time, but I don't anymore. I'm not sure why."" My feeling is that the general public has largely forgotten the food safety scare. The only people I see still talking about it are on Wall Street. McDonald's stock collapsed after the Nifty Fifty craze at a similar point in its history, just as almost all fast casual stocks are in the toilet now after a period of euphoria. This, too, shall pass.",

And if/when Enphase goes out of business... I am in a pretty bad place.I work with clients wanting larger PV arrays located behind their meter (to date 40 kW to 3.5 MW) as an owners agent.  Inverters are the weak point of a PV system.  So when we select an inverter we look at the financials of the company - to answer the basic question - will they be around to back their warrantees?  Today, for Enphase it is very hard to say ""yes"".  With SolarEdge it is much easier.",
Maybe Solaredge should just buy Enphase? It’s only 250 mil. I’m sure there are some smart people in Solaredge that have a plan to tackle this.,
"Up until last year ENPH's R&D budget was twice that of SEDG. The reason was string inverters are basically old tech while ENPH was breaking ground on completely new tech. You can't look backwards to see how their competition will play out going forward because ENPH just released their IQ7 a few weeks back. LG did not shelve their own microinverter to pair with ENPH's old line of inverters.   They waited for the IQ series. Panasonic and Jinko waited for the IQ7.To understand ENPH as an investment today you have to hold your nose when looking at their financials and dig into their products instead. As for future R&D expense ENPH only has one basic product line to support world wide going forward and they've already turned their inverter line into a digital software based one. What that means is every year they will get smaller,  more efficient and cost less to produce. What you'll see this year is those cost reductions will move margins up to SEDG's level turning ENPH solidly profitable. While 2018 will be a year of margin and profit growth for ENPH 2019 will be the year dramatic revenue growth kicks in  as the IQ7 will start to make in roads internationally just as the IQ8 hits the market..... opening up a completely new market as it's off grid capable. The bottom line,  if you're new to ENPH and unsure of it's future,  is just listen to each new quarterly C. C.  going forward and open an investment when it hits your comfort level....because as each quarter goes by it's future will become ever clearer.",
What is the cost difference between Solaredge and Enphase where they compete in same segment? I mean if Enphase has a superior product but price is higher then it may not aleays do a breakthrough. Also what is Enphase’s global reach? And why haven’t Solaredge with their massive R&D something similar on the roadmap already if this is the way forward technically? I guess until Solaredge will own the market until Q3 and stock will be strong. Then we will see in Q4 really how strong Enphase will be globally.,

"Great article Andrew,Thanks!Long CORT",
Good Article Andrew and thanks to that I am now a follower of you and your writings.  I believe Cort has very little to worry about from Teva.  Teva is looking to get something for nothing and will lose this battle if they do not lose they will gain a generic that only can be used for abortions by a pill.  Good Luck with that.  Cort was smart to work on a better formulation for Korlym and that speaks volumes for Management.  I am invested heavily in this company going back to when this was a $4 stock.  I am not giving up on that investment because someone like Teva wants to illegally gain access to Korlym.  When Cort125134 is approved by the FDA and I trust this management to know they will cross the finish line with this drug.  Their pipeline into Oncology is very exciting and if they cross the FDA finish line with even just one of these drugs a buyout will be on the table from a major pharmaceutical.  Only then would my investment in Cort end but with a huge smile on my face.  Keep on writing and we your followers we keep on enjoying those writings.,

"Update on this: My read on things is that the CEO being let go, cost cutting of a few million dollars next year, coupled with the fact the Chairman of the board was an ex-M&A banker is that this company is being sold at some point.

We know they had $16mn of cash as of the last financials, and in the almost-year since the last current financials were updated (ARRGGG), they probably generated another $4 million, so that's $20mn in cash vs. a $50mn market cap. As for the financials not being current, it had to do with foreign subsidiaries and IMO the issues aren't really too worrying, though the fact it's taken them a year to get current is ridiculous and shows frankly how lazy and ineffectual management is here.",

"The problem is Apple have too much cash, and don't know what doing with it, and this is the big problem !!",
One big difference is that APPL has cash it does not know where to park. The challenge APPL has is that the devices gat more powerful and more reliable each year and the number of users of the devices is reaching a saturation point. This is going to affect every device manufacturer. The advantage is to the Indian and Chinese manufactures who can provide more powerful devices and better reliability at lower prices for those who cannot afford an iPhone or the Samsung devices. Eventually they will reach a saturation point also after which someone one or more competitors will have to drop out of the race. And that will be the ones that cannot remain profitable. Here is where Apple has the advantage of higher margins. And hopefully will continue to remain in the market without growth in revenue and profits and also dip in revenue or profit.,

And IBM had competition in its own hardware business which provided better and cheaper PCs; this too has happened in the phone business where Blackberry, Lumia/Nokia/Microsoft and some before them have disappeared. The iPhone's big competition is Samsung and some Chinese and Indian upstarts. It is still improving market share; a little slower now than before. One of these companies will have to bring a product that is better liked than Apple before that market share disappears. By product I mean the Apple hardware and the support services on it. One will not do. Microsoft 950/950XL are far superior hardware than the priciest iPhone twice in cost but it failed on getting the app developers to build apps. This was their downfall even though the hardware was superior, the phones looked as good or better and its software interfaced with Windows much better and had Windows apps that worked seamlessly to the point it was starting to get to being a Pocket PC.I think Apple's advantage is its huge income, which it now needs to use to acquire a company or two each year.

At this point we often let others take the risk of innovation, and when it was shown that there was a market for the innovative product, we jumped in with a product that had all of our muscle behind it, and this sort of strategy - let others prove that there is a market for the new idea - was effective.  Think the original IBM PC (Charlie Chaplin) -Commodore, Apple and others proved the market, and IBM pounced. Now think of Apple, and don't worry that they aren't always first to market with innovation. Apple has the strongest brand in the world, and they sometimes let others take the risk of innovation, and then they pounce.  Apple will not grow as it has in the past, due to the pure inertia of size.

"""it would need another iPhone like product to grow revenues in double digits on a long-term basis.""IBM has had 22 consecutive quarters of lower revenue Y/Y, until it recently eeked out a small gain, mostly from currency issues caused by the weak US dollar. Comparing that to AAPL is ridiculous, which is why Buffett sold his shares.",

"""Buffett's Bet In Apple Can End Up Like IBM""---- Can, but not likely. Consider the age and history of IBM before you go comparing Apple to IBM's current status.",
"Rather than AAPL vs IBM I think a better analogy is AAPL vs KO.  Both companies operate as the dominant company in a duopoly, have a deeply entrenched high margin business, consumers believe that while expensive their products are necessary for daily life, have strong global brands and produce far more cash than the business needs.Buffett bought KO in 1989 before its global expansion whereas AAPL has already had that expansion but both companies have established their businesses globally.  KO today probably looks something like what AAPL will look like in 10-20 years.  Struggling to find revenue growth but still delivering substantial value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.  Over the past 10 years KO's revenue has grown 45%, dividend payout has more than doubled and share count has declined 10%.  Buffett receives annual dividends from KO that are greater than his cost basis in the investment.One also has to understand the investing game that Buffett and Berkshire are playing.  If they make a large investment that beats the S&P for 1 or 2 years and then matches the S&P for the next 20 years while paying a substantial dividend, that is a huge win for the company.  This is not the same investing game that younger investors are playing who are hoping for stocks that grow 15-30% every year.  Buffett sees AAPL with about 1/3 of its market cap in cash which it has shown clear intent of returning to shareholders and it doesn't need a lot of revenue or earnings growth for the investment to be successful by their standards.IBM is an inferior company in every way to AAPL besides their buybacks, which has been clearly demonstrated over the past 10 years.  No revenue growth, a brand that is weakening, business lines that are entrenched only in the past, unable to compete against Amazon and tech startups, etc.  Will AAPL suffer a similar fate?  Perhaps but it will have to fall quite a bit from its current high position.",
There is no legitimate comparison between the two companies. They're not even a little bit alike in any way.,
"Buffett has proved over long, long time to be one of the best ever with his investments. His net worth proves it.I wish this writer the same success but I do doubt he will get there?Apple will outlive all of us in one form or another, the same goes for IBM!Who knows what will happen in 10 years to any company operating successfully today?",
Couldn’t agree more with that statement. I think buffet will dump aapl long before he lets what happened to him with ibm.more and more people are holding on to their phones longer and upgrading to lower models.,
IBM never had the cash on hand like Apple does or they global footprint in consumer electronics. Such a lazy comparison.,
"I think Buffett sees Apple as a tech ecosystem that creates its own ever-increasing value, and as a tech company secondarily.  IBM was a bet on an old line tech company re-inventing itself (for the second or third time) to produce a tech advance.  That’s a much harder transition than Buffett realized when he invested, and his decision to take the loss and go in another direction was a recognition of that difficulty level.  Remember that Buffett prefers to shoot fish in a barrel after the water has been drained out.  IBM is not yet in that category with its transition.   But Apple is a very different company than IBM.  It has found ways to generate cash in its tech ecosystem that don’t require it to be the latest and greatest, while at the same time being capable of producing the latest and greatest tech.  It’s that first category that will keep Apple afloat and moving forward.",
"Excellent article, which reveals the grim truth of Apple's present and the even grimmer truth of its future.

"Your entire thesis revolves around revenue growth.  Buffett is far less concerned with revenue growth and more concern about internal returns and cash generation.  One of his best investments ever, Sees Candy, had about 3% revenue growth but churned out enormous piles of cash.  Apple is a cash cow and a lot of that cash will create pleasant outcomes (reinvestment, buybacks, dividends).  Selling iPhones is similar to selling razor blades - a repeat business that generates large margins.  Apple doesn't need a new product.",
AAPL long,
"Interesting article, but it needs to be taken with a great deal of skepticism. Apple has shown itself over the past couple of decades that it can not only continue to grow but remain as the most profitable company in history.I do not know what the next ""big thing"" will be, but I am sure that Apple will come out with a competing product that is better, more efficient, with a beautiful design to boot. My one concern is the lack of growth in China and some other Asian countries. If you read all articles about Apple as I do, you are probably aware of its competition from less costly phone makers. Despite what Tim Cook on the most recent conference call about his happiness with the company's growth in China, there are serious concerns here and in India as well that Apple is not doing well here.",
Thanks for the humor. You earned my click.,
"I must concede: SA is becoming a really funny, even humoristic site.The thesis here: IBM 2011=AAPL 2018. And as Buffet is unable to see more than the three numbers of AAPL financials you do, he will make false steps again.Perhaps that's why he is the best investor in history, and you are... what?",
"I see the similarities the author is making. Apple will eventually be a failure of its own success as IBM and CSCO. The difference at this point is there is no replacement for the smartphone as there was with the demise of the computer. Right now though it is better to put money in Apple because of tax reform and their large cash position. The argument about their ecosystem is true but under Cook it is getting weaker due to lack of innovation and execution. For instance, I was anti-Apple for the longest time because Android IMO was a superior operating system and when the Galaxy 3 and subsequent ones launched I was proven correct. The benefit to Apple at the time was they had the best laptop, tablet, streaming TV, and fitness trackers which eventually forced me into an iPhone. Now with the emergence of comparable tablets, laptops, streaming tv, fitness trackers and the addition of connected homes like Nest and voice-powered devices like Alexa and eventually the autonomous car their ecosystem is getting weaker. Cook is competing against Page, Zuckerberg, and Bezos which are superior.",
"IBM does not equal AAPL. They compete in totally different industries. Equating the two based upon buybacks misses 99% of the analysis. No mention of the other things that drive EPS growth (services business, new products -- AirpPod, HomePod, Apple Music).",
"IPhone is a way of life. It literally holds a lot,of,your personal and business information. Unless some and don’t know who,it would be for the unforeseen future that could replace Apple with better Technology. Certainly not Samsung or Google of Microsoft or Amazon.

They will simply become a dividend paying machine and the share buybacks will result in growth in EPS. Plain and simple. There are a Billion users who LOVE the IOS interfaces. They are also loved by the young people. They get them when they are 3-4-5 years old now.That is their genius.Have you not seen that Ad on TV where the lady asks the youngsters working on his IPad what he is doing on his Computer and the child goes “what computer”. THAT IS THE APPLE GENIUS.KEEP ON HOPING.ANY PULLBACK again will be used advantageously by Apple to aggressively buy back their shares.It is a self fulfilling prophecy.",

I am still long Apple, but a good investor has to always question his investments and be on the lookout for new investments and even though current investments might have made a good return in the past there is no guarantee for the future and there might be other investments that are more promising. After all: you only have that much money, so you would want to place it on stocks that promise the best possible returns. For the time being I'll stick to Apple, but Im on the lookout.",

"Keeping amzn, baba and dropped Google today!",
"The painful reality in investing is that valuation matters. The main thrust of your article is that Amazon has an extreme valuation, even given the fact it is an excellent fast growing company. And that BABA has a more reasonable valuation and excellent growth and profitability prospects and may be the better risk/reward. Given the hard data you present, that seems like a reasonable viewpoint and very much worth considering.There are some macro factors that it would be interesting to get your feedback on, if you have time:1. What is your assessment as to the accuracy, transparency, and completeness of BABA's financial statements? What is your gut level feel for whether they can be trusted? What do you think of the short's arguments in this regard (BABA I think is very heavily shorted)?2. What do you think the risk is of the Chinese government negatively interfering with BABA's business? How big a risk is that? Has that been a negative factor for other large Chinese companies?3. A number of folks in the US that I have talked to that have used Alibaba had negative experiences (poor quality goods and issues with returns). Are there independent third party assessments of Alibaba's quality and user experience? If they have major deficiencies in that area, will they fix them or will they get out-competed by JD and Amazon?4. One of the key drivers of growth for ecommerce companies like Amazon and Alibaba is the multi-sided platform moat. The biggest competent ecommerce outfit dominates. The more vendors an ecommerce site has, the more customers it will attract, all other things being equal. The more customers they have, the more vendors they will attract. This effect then gets extended to other ""sides"" of the platform, including attracting more advertisers, fintech vendors, etc. In the US, Amazon has dominated in part due to this moat. China is 4X the size of the US (1.3b people vs 325m in the US) and thus has many more customers and vendors. Their domestic market is protected by the government and by their culture. That market is growing rapidly both in terms of customers and in terms of per capita income. From a multi-sided platform perspective with a protected 4X larger domestic market, it would seem both JD and BABA have a huge advantage in the global ecommerce competition (eg they have more customers, more vendors, more everything). Do you think that is a major factor for BABA's future global expansion? If so, how come it is rarely discussed?Thought your article was well written. AMZN is a killer company, but the valuation leaves little room for error, particularly in the face of the competition from Walmart. And it is not at all clear that AMZN will win the global ecommerce competition. Things are riskier than AMZN bulls want to admit, imho.",
"We disagreed on this consensus for quite sometime. Don't get me wrong, but I can speak for an investment club I am a member of. We like some of the Chinese hyped stocks, but petrify over the China syndrome of government interference in such matters. Our call on AMZN has been ridiculously easy. If the doubters out there would look through some of the fog cloaking most any position one puts his mind to, he'll see punditry pounding their tables of leisure for a 2018 price of at least $1750. We don't operate that way. What we do see are flamboyantly higher prices before 2018 grinds to a halt. That's pretty flippant for me! For starters on supporting that flippant thesis on Amazon, consider Walmart's falling down on earnings. Do you know the Walton kids?",
I buy lots of things online. I have never used Amazon. I don't see why people think Amazon is so great.,
"Good on you for falling in love with the company, but not the stock.",
"AMZN is a horrid company. Read the stories of people who work(ed) there: routine 80 hour weeks, new mothers getting fired for underperformance, heaven help you if you get sick and need a few days off. How would you like to be a warehouse worker who gets fired because s/he's not running fast enough to suit Bezos and his minions? That's just the human side. Do you really think AMZN could have grown that fast w/o central bank laxness all these years? They continually issue shares and borrow money at low rates, all to produce razor thin margins. Bezos is merely another slave driver in a suit - enjoy the party while it lasts, amazonians",
"I basically agree with the thesis of the article, although probably not a bad idea to own both.",
"Might have been better to sell half and use that to buy BABA.  Less of   both, but selling part of big gainers has been  profitable for me over the years.",
"MKM Partners maintains a Buy rating and raises its Amazon price target from $1,350 to $1,750, a 19% upside to yesterday’s close. Analyst Rob Sanderson calls Amazon “the best growth story of all the mega-caps over the very long term.”",
Biggest mistake I made was selling Amazon on the day of its last earnings report. Now too late to buy back in.,
Don't disagree - I imagine greater pressure from Google Compute Platform and Azure will continue to eat into their cloud offerings over time as we begin to enter the main engagements of the Great Cloud War.,
"Big question is China and USA relationships in trade. If the relationship sours, the ASIAN markets will tumble and take Wall Street with it. Seems everything I touch these days is made in China or some small 3rd world country in Asia. Have shares in BABA, but watch it every day. Then what is BABA's top price, do we hold or sell?",
"Confounded Interest,Amazon is up by 462% in the past 5 years.  Alibaba is only up by 148% during the same period of time.I would not have sold Amazon.",
Yea dump a wildly successful American company for a company in a communist country that you have no control over.  Not the brightest bunch in this batch.,
I always enjoy listening to people who don't truly understand what's happening advise other people who are even less aware of what's happening.....it's always been great entertainment for me....all the best....,
Thank you for your writeup Confounded Interest. You could have sold some (not all) AMZN to buy BABA. No harm to diversify in a very exciting space of two behemoths.,
"AMZN's stock price ascent owns the past, while BABA's will own the future. Just a matter of time before the USA hits AMZN with antitrust violations. You can't continue to run retail competitors out of business by funding it's ecommerce (especially logistics) with profits from AWS. At some point, some politician will rise up proclaiming the need to end the destruction of businesses and job losses by attempting to label AMZN as some kind of ""Death Star"". Granted, such claims may not be entirely factual but when has a politician let facts get in the way of a good story.He will demand the breakup of AMZN into 3 separate businesses: Ecommerce, Cloud, Logistics. BABA does not have such problems as its revenues are derived outside the USA.AMZN's ecommerce business will be revalued at a much lower PE thus its stock price will  adjust lower accordingly. As to which politician this may be, one can only guess. However, one shouldn't be surprise if said politician either currently resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave or aspires to one day. Can you say Teddy Roosevelt?",
"I think I just read this article for the entertainment. I have a portfolio value of just under $1 million, I find it hard to take a meaningful position in Amazon. I try to keep any single company position under 2 to 5% of my portfolio. That would mean I would be able to buy at most 50 shares of Amazon or less. 25 if the value goes up to $2000 per share. I left Amazon when it went from $400 per share up to $800 per share. Happy I made a double wish I could’ve stayed longer. It was a great romance while it lasted.",
"As a 19 year user of EBay, I watched Alibaba grow and I still see Alibiaba containing a large amount ofshady counterfeit sellers peddling cheap quality products that when break you have no recourse... compared to ordering from better vetted sellers on Amazon with a return policy second to none.  I recently purchased 3 LED lamps from a Chinese storefront on AmaZon, all3 lamps came in that subpar cheap Chinese packaging with styrofoam, ripped boxes, all3 broken in some form or fashion.  If it wasn’t for using Amazon, I would have never received refunds.  Alibiba vendors are also a nightmare to communicate with, less vetted and when I have made a purchase in the past I then started seeing and increase in spam and phishing emails.  What can be said about investing in a thoroughbred race horse vs a burro ... because The burro looks extremely cheap? There are several more comparators where Amazons business surpasses Alibaba.  This is my perspective as a single male customer in an urban city that orders as much as humanly possible online, I use most of Amazons products and access it multiple times daily toCheck prices on items in my shopping cart.  I also mostly try to purchase Amazon fulfilled to avoid any shady sellers.",
"Good luck to you!....I really hope it works out....Bugs Moran, as I recall had a similar Valentines Day experience....http://bit.ly/2BGIwmU",
"When you buy ""Alibaba Stock"" what are you actually purchasing?Alipay is important, but I don't think BABA has an ownership stake in ANT, so it's somewhat irrelevant.",
"Buy BABA & JD For Hyper growth and stock Appreciation.With all due respect for AMZN, they are a very Good Company,But BABA  is a lot BetterBUY BABA & JD for the long-termShould you want less expensive stock to track BABA  Look at AABA",
Agree with everything stated except Walmart competition because they only offer cheap products. Amazon and Alibaba offer a range of quality. Long on Asian BAT stocks,
I like baba and have leaps but that was one foolish move. Amazon heading to $2000 you’ll never see $800 sorry but foolish,
Look at Altaba (AABA),
Couldn’t agree with you more!  What a great year this is going to be!,
Bad timing of the article. Check out what happened to Walmart due to Amzn dominance,
Beautiful timing as Amazon kicks Walmart to the curb.  Next up!  LOL,
"Agree on BABA, JD and even TenCent.  However, most WalMart stores in China have 30-40 checkouts running non-stop.  Employees stock shelves continuously.  Home deliveries (many by bicycles) are exploding.  Consumerism is rapidly rising!  SF Express is largest nationwide delivery firm.  Interesting that AMZN statistics for fulfillment and shipping is nearly up to retailer expenses, but still lower.",
"I like the BABA-JD-TCEHY combo.  All are more reasonably priced vs. AMZN with more room for global growth potential.  AMZN  operating income is AWS-driven (>60%) and the switching costs of moving off AWS are going down, not up. Azure revenue is growing at a much faster clip than AWS.  The argument that AMZN can turn on profitability of its non-AWS business if it shuts off its growth engine is speculative at best and dangerous at worst.  Any company trading at above 200 P/E should be viewed with skepticism.",
"If AMZN goes up another $500 from the break up date and BABA only goes up $50 in the same let's say 1 year time frame, is it worth it?",
"I agree with your valuation concerns, but the entire market is stretched to all time record high valuations (using the most historically accurate measurements). My point being that if AMZN gets cut in half, BABA probably will too.",
"How about JD , the true amazon of China ? BABA is more like eBay",
very smart and daring move my friend.long baba,

Looks like ATHX is definitely worth Healios's time.,
"mookdoc, sounds rather mean spirited, too bad. Life is too short.",
Uncle BUD!I will drive there personally and buy you a drink while you watch me drink my Pepsi in blue jeans...let me know the dates?  You and your wife can listen to me slander ATHX AND MGT...FOR HOURS...I Can't WAIT,
"Hal you just gave perfect example of Uncle Bud's comments about athx inability to clarify along the way the important facts.....you say the Treasure trial added a year to 2020 for the release of the results...NO NOT TRUE...still early 2019 and will be before that imo...2020 date has NOTHING to do with the clinical study time table....it is and EXTRA different agenda of keeping up with the patients one year later for an update to see if any changes have further happened on healing from strokes or going backwards and showing some stroke symptoms that had gone away....in FACT athx just finished another one year check up on the first group treated in the U:S:   Hang in there uncle bud,  great thing about athx is that any big market declines cannot affect this type stock LONG TERM, short term some yes but whether ATHX is 1.28, or 1.32 or 2.44 will not matter if  (when imo) clinical results score a big success you see jumps to 20 or 30 or higher immediately..",
"Uncle Bud, Good to hear from you, I agree that the PR/ Investor Relations dept for ATHX's seems to be really deficient (which most likely may come from the top down?), but I also believe that business plan execution, IMO, seems also really deficient and appears needs to be imperatively corrected/bettered. Note: a recent release from Healios appears to have indicated that they were addressing better business plan execution by putting in some new Board of Directions?  IMO, adding approx. another year until 2020? for the potential release of the Treasure trial  results seems to imply that something also is Really lacking there as well?  I'm still long ATHX and like you, I really believe in the science/technology but have been diversifying more into PSTI. (got bought  out of TIG, but can't complain).Let me know where you'll be waiting in the Bellagio lobby, (I'll be the one holding the Go ATHX sign in a white sports coat; sorry no pink carnation).

"I couldn't stand to watch the pps drop like it has without questioning the logic behindit.

Lets see if they learned anything from all of this griping and have a change of heart in the way they conduct this cc in 2weeks and dispense info in a better manner. The ball is in their court.....,
"Let me just get this straight.   You're saying that ATHX, which hasn't burned over $10 million a quarter - which averaged under $7 million/quarter cash burn as reported for 2017 will suddenly blow through the $27 million they have now and between $36.4 million from the Aspire deal at current prices and $100 million if prices increase in a single year?  Your claim that they may make it through the clinical trial and 2018 is rather suspect.  You're suggesting that the company will suddenly be burning roughly $16 -$32 million per quarter?!  That's a rather absurd assessment without any factual data to support your thesis or math.  Furthermore - your timelines are wrong, as we have previously stated in our own articles.  https://seekingalpha.c...Where are your sources for the persistent questions on the efficacy of Multistem?  The scientific community, analyzing the Phase II results, didn't have any significant issues or questions.  It was demonstrated to be effective as designed for the trial prior to modification (which, as it so happens, mimics the current PIII design).  Conjecture is not a meaningful approach to investment decisions.",

I addressed the sham that they  call a cc with no opportunity for shareholder input.I also repeatedly bring up the total absence of insider buying at these prices....or any price for that fact....and the board of directors being overly generous with compensation, etc. I want current info and timely updates. it is up to them to be responsive.",
"Lol.  It was a good try John but your article is so very one sided.  Makes a person very suspicious of the intent.  After all this isn't the first time a very bearish article has been written about Athersys with the express intent of driving the share price down.  Truth be told although dilution is inevitable they can draw cash through Aspire as needed.  This is better than a full on offering.  Of course this will drag down the SP over time but only until 90 results emerge from the TREASURE study.  Positive results from the TREASURE study far outweigh the loss from coming dilution.  Essentially the risk to reward ratio is highly attractive to speculative investors.  Finally if you are too skittish to invest in a company with this kind of profile, then you should not be trying to write these kinds of articles without doing a better job at conducting your due diligence.",
"On Feb 15th Helios presented their financial results. The next presentation will be in another three months, about May 15th. At that time, we hope, when the CEO will tell us when the 220th and last patient WAS enrolled. Last Feb 15 he first mentioned that the enrollment is moving forward. Then a few seconds later he went back again to talk of the enrollment and said... ""things are moving forward, are really quick"", saying it with enthusiasm in his voice. I take this emphasis on the enrollment's progress is because the enrollment is moving faster than expected so he is pleased. (He is the founder of Helios like Gil is the founder of Athersys.)It is possible that on or about May 15 when he makes his 1st Qtr Report he may be able to give us a hint as to patients results. At that time somewhere between 1/2 to 2/3 of the patients would have gone beyond the 30-45 days from the time of treatment.The first 30-45 days is the time when patients usually show significant benefits from the treatment. However, because this trial is a double blind trial, the researchers will not be able to tell for sure how effective the treatment has been. It is only after the last patient gets treated will they unmask who got the treatment and who got the placebo. At this point they will get a hint as to the degree of success the treatment has been..I am sure if it is good, like outcomes being good for more than 30% of the patients (60% for the 110 who received the Multistem cells and not the placebo) then we can expect Helios to apply for a conditional approval under the SAKIGAKE program. With such high efficacy level, given the patient outcomes in Ph2 US trials, Conditional Approval is very likely and is almost equivalent to a full approval. For practical purposes, the estimated end of the preliminary trial on March 2020 will only be a formality.http://bit.ly/2BuaqSO   Listen carefully around minute four.",
March will tell the tale,
"Now that ATHX stock is lower, maybe it's time for Gil to ask/receive another alleged Dec 2017?$100 k bonus? (perhaps even more stock options)?. This seems, IMO, to be SOP for ATHX? I do not mind paying for performance but perhaps some at ATHX mgmt. think that investors may be able to be led like sheep?  Sorry don't have time to see exactly when Gil allegedly received/asked for an approx addtl $100k, but believe it was in the recent  Dec./Jan time frame?Also Curious: Where are those up to 30 medical sites in Japan that I believe? were earlier indicated might be used for the Treasure enrollment/clinicals? Gee Wally, maybe if they only have one or two Treasure sites in Japan, that still is within an up to 30 sites?.  Wonder if Treasure enrollment would go Much faster if they had more sites/hospitals in Japan?   Good Question Beav, maybe some day someone will tell us why it is taking so much time for enrollment with a Japanese population of over 125 million?.   (For all you: 'Leave it to Beaver' fans)",
"Science of Fortune  explains the misunderstanding about the completion time of the Japan III phase trial time few days ago. The company has secured good funding only when is needed to avoid unnecessary dilution. That gives them the time to secure good partnership.What is left to be shown is the science. But even  when it comes to that, Stem cells are proven effective in Ti-genix Belgian company with two products the last few years. The science just starter to show and this was started 50 years ago... The rest don't  worth my comment as they are just words of Shorters......",
No mention of other indications such as ARDS or acute MI? ARDS data should be imminent. Also any “persistent worries” only come from not understanding what the Ph2 data shows. I am waiting until this short piece manipulates the price down short term then I am buying more long shares. Aspire credit line allows ATHX to keep the market fo themselves and not give away royalties on the back end with US/EU partner. Target= 20-25 BB market cap,

If you anticipate being able to ask an appropriate question at cc then dream on.every cc is identical with the same staged three participants asking softball  questions then the cc is shut down with no investors ever getting to ask a question. As far as progress on other studies, ami and ards, we get no info . Personal requests directed to IR yields nothing. We have a cash strapped company with executives taking huge salaries and then huge cash bonuses and all selling shares on a regular basis .... with no history of any of them actually buying. I hope the science is great with a big payoff but as time  progresses I just witness the same bad behavior . Every cc for years  mentions partnering talks with zero results and no info while hiding behind NDA’s. Last year’s surprise secondary with huge price hit was a killer.

What is your basis for believing SIGM gets to keep the $69m in cash? If you think about it, the original deal was buying the whole company for ~$282m (including that cash). Now, Sigma failed to meet certain conditions (probably selling their other division) so the deal was adjusted.You think suddenly the buyer only takes over the z-wave business for $240m and leaves $69m in cash on the balance sheet? I.e. they refuse to pay $42m extra for $69m in cash and a business that has just been sold for $28m?

"With the new hiring of this CEO which everyone is saying that he is a lightweight and maybe as bad as Evans who was incompetent and a joke it seems no decent Oil Exec.,would even jumpinto this sick bed and they had to get someone from the bottom of the barrel. I have been liquidating my position over the last three months as I believe this year end and qtr will beanother herring. I really believe the competence level of the C-suite up to now has been theworst I have ever seen and how the BOD let it get this bad is not only sad but criminal. Whereis SS in this I don't know but I have to say he also should have put his foot down way beforeit got this bad.  I believe the company should be sold or merged for stock using the tax loss and reserves in the ground and make the hocked assets worth something again. To try tomake a change at this point is futile as Evans and the BOD have dug a hole that is so deepthat only a miracle and a very talented CEO could maybe turn it around but the reality is thata merger with another will do that in a much faster and cleaner way eliminating the BOD and c-suite and cutting expenses to where this solvable . PGH does not have the where with all and talent to do that now.  Why break your neck to climb the mountain when you can startgoing down the mountain in a positive way.",
Another question.  The 2p npv10 reserves of Lindbergh are worth 2.7b according to the latest slide deck.  Yet someone paid 250mm for 4% of Lindbergh.  With that valuation Lindbergh is worth 250/.04 or 6.25b.  Which calculation is closer to the true value of Lindbergh?   And why would someone pay 250mm for 4% knowing what the npv10 is?  Thanks.,
"What if I told you that five years from now wcs diffs were single digits because of keystone xl, oil was 85, Lindbergh was at 30000 per day and debt was only 300mm.  Where would the stock be?",

In Russian Sametz (Самец) means an alpha-male. I guess it is a good sign for PGH.,
Is he here to make nice with the banks so in the upcoming years they won't be a Scrooge and lock the doors and do a pre packaged BK and let somebody else try to make it work? Or will he use the 45 mill in the budget for capital projects like it is outlined and approved by the board? Is he getting a nice fat paycheck for being the guy that gets the blame for things that go wrong or is his compensation include stock options for REAL performance? Is he betting the house on a rise in oil prices like the prior administration did and was partially bailed out by the price we have today? If the prior projects and gas/oil pipelines in the USA get up and running like they are being rushed now push up the supply and cause the price to decline how is he prepared for that? Are we going to play the hedge game again at these prices? Might be something to think about since alot of new discovery's are being made and the time to complete them have changed from decades to only a few years.,
"very thin volume yesterday and today. I hope SS will sell all his shares since right now he does not have a right to buy. However, the right to sell he still have it",
Cool,
"Maybe Derek didn’t have it in him to streamline the company as much as what was needed? A new CEO takes out any cronyism Derek may have had.  I was surprised they canned the Thermal Guy and kept the older, conventional guy as COO.  I hope he was the better choice. But a new CEO means all people In the company, including the C-suite are on notice.  Fresh set of eyes inside the company is a very good thing.",
"Honestly, an idiot could run pengrowth now.  Slowly build up volumes at Lindbergh with internally produced cash.  Your natural gas inputs for steam are hedged with the motney volumes.

"I'm sticking around just to see this company go to zero under Peter, look at his past experience, nothing more than a destroyer of shareholder value.Welcome Derek Evans II",
"Unfortunately Mr.Peter Sametz was Pres. and COO of Connacher Oil and Gas at the same time as Richard Gusella was its CEO(circa 2012)...that combination did nothing for their shareholders and soon after the company went into CCRA status where it remains to this day,with extensions the norm.I bring this up because CLL was a heavy oil producer that by all accounts talked a good game with its thousands and thousands and thousands of acres that held hundreds of millions of barrels of crude...well it takes a team...and a track record to navigate from 'talk' to 'walk' and Peter's record is out there for all to see.... because Peter Sametz has 'experience' in the oil sector he will do just fine here?? That storyline has yet to be written.   Is he being brought in to find that all 'elusive' Swiss Mix financing that seemed to have dragged CLL into CCRA?  Or to find us a dance partner?  I will take both or just one but do something!  As for financing...there is creative financing then there is just plain old fashioned greed financing...I would hope he sticks to the former...Would Peter want to be known as the CEO who dragged Pengrowth, a stalwart(ok,a longtime producer) in the Cdn oil patch for decades into the gutter? I am sure the couple of million dollars he will be paid this yr will go along way in helping him overcome this issue...should it ever arise,which I am betting does not.Pengrowth has staked its future on expanding Lindbergh but has yet to find the funds to expand,except they have laid the pipeline from Groundbirch so that they can use their own gas supply/reserves to feed its thermal needs,smart move in this period of low gas prices and over-supply but this is only a start...a merger is required in my opinion to move the shareprice from its decline. Whether this merger will reward existing shareholders or just give hope of recovering some of the lost value in the shareprice over the year(s) just can not be told today but at least if PGF/PGH is tie-ed into another entity(a successful entity) then at least shareholders today have some outlook(ok,hope) that the new entity that PGF/PGH has attached itself too will succeed where Evans and Co. have failed and in that regards the BOD should have been replaced by all the shareholders voting to remove them,why this never occurred can only be summed up in my opinion,""as an old boy's club that does not like to eat their own"". Seriously.I do not like the track record of Sametz(there is nothing in his past that shouts success,in my opinion.) but if he can manage(just do this one act or two) to find us a partner to grow(or to find the money to grow) with then he will be remembered as a successful CEO if not then his time here will only add another name to the top of his CV,while shareholders continue to suffer.**** Why would Seymour Schulich and friends prefer  Sametz over Evans today after so many yrs of decline....What is the connection? Are they knowledgeable of one another? Who made the suggestion to have Peter come in today and Derek leave?   A benefit of the doubt to Sametz as to how much decision making power he controls to ruin this company anymore than what the Evans and BOD combo, have not already hoisted upon shareholders. GLTALatest price :  PGF 0.94...flat on the day                      PGH 0.7348....how many decimal pts are needed to make money here??",
"My question to the BOD with the departure of Evans is what took so long?  It was obvious to everyone that he was not the man for this company before the asset sales and direction and his vision that have put this company at peril at this present time.  The BOD is also responsible forthe condition of this company at the present time. The only worth of this company is the oil thatis in the ground as they have hocked everything for the benefit of the lenders so shareholders are naked at this point.  I think the damage Evans did with the BOD by acquiring assets in thepast few years taking on more debt and selling them at more then fire sale prices, not leavingenough Lt. oil assets to generate cash flow will not bode well for PGH to survive barring a miracle.  Even with this new CEO who knows how good he is.  To me he may be in a thankless position and I do believe that they could not get a major turn around guy because no one wants to jump on a sinking ship.  I'm afraid the next report will be nothing short of a disaster with plenty of excuses. This company should be put up for sale as WCS prices are so out of sight to WTI how can you make a buck. All the WCS producers are more or less hostages because of transportation costs, lack of Govt extending pipelines to where they can sell into Asia etc,  They are held captive and need higher WTI prices to just survive at this present time.  This is a perfect play for a merger of which another company that wants to diversify in WCS and believes with time time that WCS will be better and can absorb the overhead costs and make this profitable as a merged entity.  I think SS is looking towards that goal as there is no other logical reason for PGH to survive.  They have too much debt, no cash flow to service debt and growth so what choices except hope that the U.S. govt stops heavy oil from Venezuela . Evans and the BOD destroyed this company and the outcome could have been a different story if they were prudent and responsible.  Every company is hard to run in good times too but usually common sense wins out but not in this case. Evans was a destroyer for the shareholders and may have put the final nail in the coffin of PGH.",
"Long - do oil companies ever trade at their NPV-10 of 2P reserves.  I mean if PGH ever did then the stock would be three dollars.  Also, I think the new CEO was hand picked by SS to be a yes sir, no sir lackey to do whatever SS wants.  Make no mistake who is likely really running the company.",
"It took a bit of reading then I hit upon C$ and that alone turned me off.  I have one C$ outfit and I do not like it.  That being ENB.  So I am sorry, you turned me off and I became much less interested in the article.  Good luck, there are a lot of good Canadians out there and they will take you up on the company.  I just do not want to deal with foreign exchange.",
"It is always easy to make excuses for poor performance, but in the end, the best course of action is to not accept excuses, but rather, change management.  To claim that Canadian E&P is challenged is an understatement, however, PGH's performance is below that of its peers.  So cheers to the Board for moving Evans out to pasture.  Although some claim that being a CEO of a Canadian E&P company is thankless, the fact is that every two weeks the CEO cashes a large check for his/her services.  If you don't perform, regardless of the business/political environment, you should no longer receive a check.Now let's hope that this same spirit of holding management responsible for performance will affect other E&P companies like OBE.",
Without the completion of TMEP or XL it seems that it is too expensive for PGH to get their product to market.,
"Being the CEO of any Canadian oil and gas company seems to be a thankless job. If you go to any of the discussion groups for any oil and gas company, the CEO is being blamed for oil prices and pipeline woes and hedging and not hedging. Apparently every CEO is an idiot and that includes the ones that built some of these companies in the first place.While I agree that Mr. Evans appeared to be slow to react, he also made some moves that kept this company from bankruptcy such as the hedges through 2016 which saved the company.Investors that think the CEO being changed out will solve all the problems are naive. I will gratefully accept a bump in stock price but Mr. Sametz is just another human being who will make his share of mistakes in one of the toughest industries in business today. Good luck Mr Sametz.",

"Bob,Thanks for your recent analyses of DBV and Aimmune. The reaction in Aimmune stock post Palisades top line data is proof to me that inmates are running the asylum. My assumption before the data was released was that AIMT would garner a 60% market share of the eligible patient population with DBV capturing the remainder who couldn't tolerate AIMT's stronger profile (assuming DBV even gets approved).  Post data, as you point out, 80% of the patient universe successfully tolerated AR101. The news is much better than expected. I see few if any impediments in the way of FDA approval at the end of the year. Based on recent takeover interest in CAR-T M&A, I like to use a 3 times peak sales number to estimate a reasonable take out number. What I would like you to explain is where you get your $3-4 bil. annual peak sales figure. I have heard other analysts mention $1.5 bil as the expected yearly patient market. If you are correct in your estimate, a $9 Bil. takeover seems more than reasonable. Unlike the CAR-T space, the peanut allergy space is less crowded, does not require as difficult a manufacturing process, can be delivered in a less costly setting, and has just as large of a potential market. My guess is there are a number of big pharma companies that may at this very moment be drooling at the prospect of being able to deliver to this unmet need. If I am correct (I was correct with Kite and Juno) a target price over 150 seems possible, even post the dilutive effect of today's secondary stock offering news.Please share your source and math for the potential annual patient dollars.

"Congrats to the CEO and team for FINALLY announcing initiatives across breakfast, digital, in store kiosks and delivery.  Now they have to POUNCE.  The customers are there, the brand has a following. Each one of these initiatives will unlock revenue that doesn't currently exist in the existing base of stores without a corresponding investment in labor, etc.If they move fast, you will see fast improving revs and margins in existing stores, the additional 10% of new store openings, a price hike, a tax break vs. wage inflation and possibly food inflation.The scales are tipped for growth. Oh how I dream of Ron Saich coming n and taking over to go up against Shake Shak.  He's just the guy to give this chain a profile on the street and to get it to be taken seriously.

"Far too many restaurants with a high percentage of company-owned units are run for growth at all costs.  Management is typically compensated based on one or more measures of growth such as revenue, operating income or EBIDTA.  This of course leads to a breakneck pace of new restaurant openings, whether capital returns are suffering or not.  As a former long-term shareholder of BWLD I watched this play out.  All was well while there was easy (good comps) growth to be had but when the comps started to weaken and good real estate began to dry up, management bought franchise units to continue the growth.  This was a horrible decision as the capital returns were terrible and the rest is history.  Far more restaurants should focus on good and stable (if not increasing) capital returns and gradual unit expansion.  When SSS falter unit growth should slow or stop until it is fixed.",

I have mentioned them before: lack of parking, indoor seating, and drive thrus.  This is, we are told y the CEO, being corrected.  If this does happen, HABT is a good prospect, but it is a long term play.  Expect continued choppy waters until the game plan is clear and comps rise.

So many options to improve this company. They could take on debt, buy back stock, have more aggressive franchise plans internationally, develop a mobile app, do delivery, sign partnerships with UberEats/Amazon, install Kiosks, increase their marketing budget. Retail investors who shy away from companies like HABT because of fear of this ""restaurant recession"" will end up leaving gains on the table. There's a reason these firms have been doing buyouts such as FOGO yesterday. It's smart to do these buyouts during a ""restaurant recession"" when multiples are depressed.",
"Those who have read my past comments can stop reading now since I’m going to repeat them.In 63 years of investing in restaurant companies,Habit fits into an eventual winner because of the following: 1/ No long term debt,all units built with cash flow from operations,2/Independent company(Consumers Union) stated it was voted best hamburger) 3/Yelp reviews are very favorable compared to their competition,many 4’s out of 5.  4/able to successfully expand out of home base of California.Note I live in Fl.and N.J.where they are doing well.5/enormous amt of growth ahead since they only have 200 units with possible 2000 total.Remember Burger King has 6000 units in U.S. and Five Guys has 1200..",
"Habit has a fantastic product but poor or little marketing because they refuse to take on debt to make a big splash in their markets which are very competitive. Also, their pricing is out of whack. Their single burgers are under $4 and are light years better than fast food. Also, the location near me in las vegas has 10 or 11 workers in it when they need about five. Crazy. A smart hedge fund will gobble them up, inject $1 billion and re-ipo at triple the size in 5 years.",
"Careful shorting some of these micro caps.  I shorted BURG which is considerably smaller than HABT.  HABT probably would have been the better choice.I shorted BURG on it's ridiculous crypto connection & the fact that as of last 10Q they had 300k cash and -4.1M working capital, negative operating margins, and declining comps.And then I learned what a boiler room operation is.  These guys do it all:* buy single shares throughout the day to hold price.* use social media to drive buyers.  Their 24/7 shills say just about anything on stocktwits & SeekingAlpha blog: short interest high!, PE interest high for acquisitions (comparing them to FOGO), making nonsense claims about billionaires being interested.. yada yada yada* have a nice little 1.2M warrants exercisable at 3.50 trap set for the momentum traders.

I think that HABT downside risk has been minimized with the drastic reduction in stock price and either a buyout or new management can bring the stock back to its former glory. Long HABT.",
You can't say enough bad things about management. Still no stores in the most lucrative location in the USA...NYC. I vote them as the worst managers of any public company. And thats the reason to never buy this company. They are as incompetent as they get. Beats me how they haven't been fired already.,
"It’s not correct to say that the reason the price is continuously down is due to SSS flattening. If that was the case, the stock would have been doing great as SSS did great and that didn’t happen, the correlation over the heads hasn’t been as suggested. The top line continues to grow nicely. There is a lot special about Habit food to those who know it, it’s not just another burger spot. One example would be Consumer Reports report on it being the best burger in the country. People in CA for one worship the good. It’s amazing to see some of the stores far from CA are doing even better than many CA stores. That says a lot about the unit growth potential. And then there’s international like the new units in Asia and other locations being tested. Habit stock has sucked but the game isn’t over. I paid $12 and it in months became $19. That wasn’t long ago at all, and the same type of sudden change from overly negative sentiment can change to positive can happen again. I’m certainly expecting the fundamentally solid, growing, attractive business they have to be validated in the end.",
"We see it as highly undervalued by the public market at this time. We look at the market cap to revenue and to ebitda. EPS is impacted by depreciation of constantly opening new stores, and that’s not the data point to focus on in the case of Habit.",
"So a $1M valuation (approx) per store is excessive based on their market cap? Remember, Habit chooses to have no debt to grow the company, which is much different than other business models. I applaud them for being responsible, but lack of debt to drive earnings has killed the stock. As for drive-throughs, IMO all restaurants by them should be, need proof, look at the lines at Starbucks. Yes, I get it’s a different food item, but people are lazy, so appeal to their laziness, like how In/Out does. I think Habit will be bought out this year by a much large company, who will expand the units as well as add franchises. In reality, as of now, you are right and I am wrong, but time will tell as I see this company growing to 500+ units. Thanks for your article.",

"As Facebook loses the purity of being a platform and becomes more intrusive, taking the feeling of being in control if one’s own profile experience away there will be worrisome issues. They are killing what was most beloved about the platform. That will continue to degrade user desire to engage in it.",
Nice read but don’t really agree,
"In Norway advertisers now spend less on Facebook than in 2017, so revenues here will go down. Maybe ARPU actually will go up, because ""nobody"" is using Facebook anymore. It is basically dead.Played a Bridge-tournament yesterday and even the 70-year olds were opting out, as their kids and grandkids were no longer posting.If it can happen in a very digital and modern country like Norway, it will probably happen other places as well later on.",
"I don't think FB's ability to drive ARPU is the problem here. FB consistently demonstrated pricing power by virtue of being a duopoly in mobile advertising and improving ad targeting (increasing ROAS for advertisers).The main question is about engagement. In contrast to prior episodes, official (FB's own) engagement numbers also show weakness in US and Europe. DAU/MAU ratio is steady/on a slight decline, and DAU's slightly declining. Now, imo there are two different narratives as to why: management's narrative that due to focus on active engagement and for instance deprioritizing passive video consumption leads to a temporary decline in time spent and DAUs. The second narrative is that FB is losing utility and therefore people are using it less. Which does seem supported by anecdotical evidence. And it might be a combination of both.I do think it's important, from a investor standpoint, to figure out which one it is. It could certainly have a significant impact on long term value. Personally, I'm not sure and need more data. The bright side may be that whatever it is, addressing fake news, increasing active engagement, etc. is the solution to both problems.",

"This article misses the point. FB’s advertisers are paying about 40% more YOY to advertise on FB. Why? Because advertisers get a high return on the best targeted advertising anywhere. As long as advertisers get a good return on their investment they will keep spending. FB is making changes to improve the site while willing to sacrifice time spent. Long term, this is more important. 2017 revenues surged almost 50% including the most recent quarter. The momentum is way, way too strong and will not suddenly decline sharply. When FB matures they will slow capital investments enabling operating margins to surge. In other words, there are many years left to compound the bottom line by 20-30%. FB is not near this inflection point. In all likelihood, FB is the single most underpriced large cap growth stock- bar none. Please tell me of a non cyclical franchise growing their top line almost 50% and bottom line in excess of 50% trading at about 21 times 2018 earnings with 40 billion in cash and no debt with two different billion user platforms not yet monetized.

"A warning about GLUU - it's been pumped and dumped multiple times over the past decade. I know that from trading with Jason Bond (jasonbondpicks.com) and have done it myself. Typically short float increases massively as it approaches 5 and 7. This has already happened twice under Mr. Earl's watch. Coincidental heavy insider selling has been a contributing factor to its demise. Historically, if the RSI rises to 80 or above at these price levels its downfall is imminent. Looking at its chart, it's best sold for gains when the price is close to 5 or 7 while the RSI is increasing at about 77. This is not a day trade-Jason calls it a small cap swing trade. Mr. Earl may have turned this around so ""swing"" traders don't own it anymore and it stands a chance of going far above 7, but that has to overcome the momentum of hundreds of traders used to pumping and dumping it with millions of dollars in aggregate.",
It insane how EA's mobile business [which include EA Mobile] is bigger than Zynga and Glu both also easy targets for EA.,
"Pigs will fly before glu mobile makes a profit. This company has a very special knack for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.  You have to have experienced it as a glu shareholder to truly appreciate what I'm saying. There's no better example of this glu incompetence than when they announced their best quarter of all time. It was one of those extremely rare quarters where glu had earned a profit. I believe they had earned 17 cents per share that quarter and they still managed to tank the stock price by 30% at their earnings call by guiding much lower for the next quarter UNNECESSARILY. Half of the coming quarter was done and they knew they were not going to do as poorly as they guided. Imagine positioning yourself to take a stake in a stock that is going to announce killer earnings numbers never seen before and they still manage to tank their stock's price. Glu mobile operates on a level of incompetence that other companies could never reach even if they tried.  The post office could take over glu mobile and they would do a better job. After seeing the massive success of their Taylor Swift app, I have faith that their new CEO is every bit as incompetent as their last one.  Glu mobile will find a way to fail.  If they enjoy any success, then a quick look at their lifetime chart makes it obvious that success at glu mobile is very short-lived. If the stock price of this company rises sharply, it falls off a cliff quickly enough. There's a reason for that. They rarely get a hit game and when they do, the popularity of that game is not going to last forever.Glu mobile has destroyed about 200 million dollars in capital in the last two years. Here's the stat I get from yahoo finance for this year:Net Income Available to Common (ttm)	-$97.57MIn the last quarter they also  took a big hit. They were aiming to lose 3 cents per share and they lost 23 cents per share because they forked over millions to make the Taylor Swift app and to advance Taylor her royalties and they are getting nothing back. They just completely blew it...again. The tradition of burning money continues.If you're looking for a good stock to invest in...you might want to check out a stock that Stone is bearish on.

"The decision by Microsoft to limit Windows 10 implementation to ARM devices may encourage many current Windows users to turn to Apple Mac Intel-based computers that can run both Mac and legacy Windows programs.  For a long time, I was puzzled by why Apple is continuing to use Intel processors for its Macs when it could have used its own ARM processors that are faster, cheaper, and more energy conservative than Intel processors.  By staying with Intel processors for their Macs, Apple will attract Windows users to the Mac.  Users of software that depend on x86/x64 code must be concerned by Microsoft’s decision to limit Windows 10 to ARM devices.  Many software developers have not yet recompiled their software to run on ARM processors and still depend on using x86/x64 code.  These include  Quickbooks and Adobe, two software manufacturer who could sink Windows 10 if they don’t recompile for ARM.Why would Microsoft take such a risk, an unnecessary risk that could scare customers into the arms of Apple customers and  lose the loyalty of millions of Windows users.  They could have easily maintained their commitment to Intel processors.  It is a bad decision and totally unnecessary.  It is not as if Microsoft has an ARM processor of their own that would benefit from their commitment.  They are helping Qualcomm but adopting Snapdragon. If I were a Windows 10 user, I would switch.  Does Microsoft understand that being third (behind Google and Amazon) in the cloud business will not continue their growth and expansion if they commit suicide by killing Windows 10, their flagship operating system.  Microsoft may be doing well in terms of revenue and profit now.  If they kill off Windows 10, they will have little or no growth in the future.  Worse, what is this decision leading to?

From Microsoft's actions, it appears Intel is able to prevent emulation of the drivers. Porting (i.e. recompiling from source) is a completely different matter.However, it would require those third parties to expend resources on getting the drivers to work. Given Microsoft's prior track record with Windows Mobile, Windows RT and Windows Phone, they are likely to conclude there is no point putting work into another MS flop in the making.",

However, DAAAP thought you would need all three for labeling...However, the FDA thinks that these categories are not separable.""can u pls post a link to where the FDA (not the comitttee) says these categories are not separable? i cant find anything from the fda itself...",
"Thanks for the mention, the update, and your overall coverage of KemPharm.  Have enjoyed the discussion on Stocktwits as well.  I will likely buy more KMPH after the decision regardless of which direction it goes... just find having too much in before the decision a bit too risky.  Could definitely envision a scenario where the drug is approved (which should be a positive) and the stock goes down.Ken Pittman, MD",
"Ag, not sure the FDA is thinking a non-ADF is the direction it wants to go.  This recently from Dr. Gottlieb: “Transitioning from the current market, dominated by conventional opioids, to one in which most opioids have abuse-deterrent properties, holds significant promise for a meaningful public health benefit.  Until we’re able to find new non-opioid forms of pain management for those who need treatment for pain, it’s critical that we also continue to promote the development of opioids that are harder to manipulate and abuse, and take steps to encourage their use over opioids that don’t offer any form of abuse deterrence.”P.S. Pricing does not confer competitive advantage.  That is only the result of a product that is VRIN...valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable.  http://bit.ly/2C9JPfg",
$KMPH Do not worry much on ADF labeling or the lack of it. It is simple:1. KMPH knows exactly what FDA is looking for  after the year long FDRR process.2.They resubmitted the exact information that provides an approval3.They started touting the Apadaz in every opportunities they get after the NDA re submission4. Company had mentioned that they are in process of discussion with Pharma partners and PBM for Apadaz after the new NDA (https://seekingalpha.c...)5. KMPH still has lots of room to run after the PDFUA .6. Apadaz will have some abuse deterrent properties ( what ever the way the final label is ) with a generic pricing . Huge advantage in this bad opioid climate7. Much valued ADHD is in phase 3 data is expected this year.8. So KMPH is no brainier to have in one's portfolio in my opinion,

Dang I love reading TSLA short comments.  Since $30 bucks going strong. The names change but little else other then the loss they amass. Investing should be an educational journey. For some its painfully not. . Hey Chanos you cost averaging your losing position yet again? So comical.,
Sometimes I wonder what seeking alpha comments would have looked like on Enron if seeking alpha existed. I can almost hear the bulls...but but they have this great partnership with blockbuster for streaming video. its going to change the world and make billions.  Which actually it did but much later as the infrastructure wasn't even close to being ready. Sounds a lot like a car company I know. The idea is fine but a far more lucrative option would have been to partner with some of the existing car manufacturers that know what the hell they are doing. Maybe tesla should go back to selling drivetrains.,
"Donn,""Tesla cannot continue as a going concern if they are going to wear all the hats of the manufacturer, dealer (providing sales and service), and energy provider (charging networks). It simply cannot be done. There just are not enough profits to pay for all of the other operations. There never will be. As sales grow so must all of the other operations. Service wait times already are rising and Model 3 sales are just getting started. Tesla has even had to tell some owners ""no service loaners are available."" What happened to Tesla renting Enterprise cars for use as loaners for Tesla owners? ""You're basing increased wait times on this article from CarBuzz with info provided by a ""tipster""Some serious in depth analysis! The CarBuzz article has a hit piece bend to it which I'm sure you see but choose to ignore for the purpose of your argumentWait times have actually decreased in my region. For the last year or so Tesla instituted a policy of not giving out loaners for fixes that took little time to correct. Historically a high percentage of service appointments took an hour or less to fix but out of courtesy Tesla took in the car for the day and gave the owner a loaner for such fixes. This isn't done anymore and has vastly streamlined service/ loaner productivity. You can often get a car in for an appointment only a few days out. As for sales:Tesla scheduled 20 minutes for my model 3 delivery and that was all that was needed for final paperwork and vehicle operation checkout. A single delivery specialist can do over 20 deliveries per day since most work is done online prior to pickup. The whole dealership model is rapidly becoming obsolete and will be replaced by a far more efficient method of car sales/support being pioneered by Tesla. The ""wearing all the hats"" is actually the strength of the model. It's only a matter of time while the kinks are worked out.The sacred cash cows of the traditional auto dealership business model are being threatened which is why NADA is expending so much effort to block Tesla in many states. If the Tesla business model is so obviously doomed to failure than why doesn't NADA just stand back and watch Tesla implode like all the prema-bears have been predicting will happen year after year. Instead each year brings new ""it will never happen"" milestones being proven false. It's ironic Musk is accused so often of making exaggerated claims by the very crowd that excels at exaggerated claims. Now we have increased institutional holdings being held up as negative market sentiment for  TSLA. A curious analysis but at least you state it's just an opinion and the meaning of  T Rowe's position is pure speculation until proven otherwise...Nice try....",

It appears that the Bloomberg VIN Number tracker is not tracking Model-3 production.It is tracking sales of the Model-3. If sales can take place 2 or 3 weeks when the car is paid for and delivered.There is no need to record the VIN Number with the NHTSA until the Model-3 is sold.In addition there may be further delay within the NHTSA in counting the Vin number.So Bloomberg is most likely under-reporting the production. It does not seem to realize this.My guess is after correcting for probable VIN reporting delays is that TESLA current production rate is between  1400 and 1600 Model-3 cars per week.I am not sure how long it takes to complete inspection and sale.,

"On balance, it looks like Tesla has attracted  significant institutional investment. The huge increase by T.

Institutional investors no doubt recognize Tesla's almost certain need for additional capital but believe the market will support a $3 billion to $5 billion stock sale without a hiccup. That capital would provide funds to sustain Tesla long enough to finally prove whether it can make a decent profit on the Model 3 or not.

"Apple are guiding for double digit growth. They blew the doors off in Q1 considering it was a week shorter, and have 51% of smartphone revenues and about 85% of the profits in the market. They’re innovating like never before and in spite of a few glitches are rapidly broadening the moat and raising the ramparts to competition by successfully attracting and keeping people in their ecosystems (90% of iPhone owners buy another iPhone… almost double the rate of mid-to-high range Android smartphone buyers - hence Apple’s rising share even in a market which isn’t growing much at the moment).When you account for the $150B in cash if you back out the $100B in debt, a company with double digit growth, and a subscriber model hardware ecosystem which accounts for 45% of its revenues, and a services and “other” category which includes the Watch, AirPods, the HomePod, and Apple Music which is growing 30-50% a year, a share price of around $170 represents a PE of about 10. I’d say that was underpriced by about 100% by any reasonable measure, especially considering the premium its peers command (not that it has any real peers really). Apple is a FCF money printing machine and none of this is priced into the stock at all.

One of the few writers that notices how high (and wrong) the analysts were with product sales numbers and weird revenue numbers given the actual ASP price increase for Iphone.  Very little to disagree with in the article. Frankly I don't know how the q1 revenue numbers would have worked for the company if they had sold as many Iphones as the analysts estimated. Revenue would have reached over 90 Billion easily. And in a 91 day quarter not 98 like the year before.  In q2 analysts must have  included a lot more Iphone X sales but fewer other Iphones  to end up averaging 65 Billion in Revenue. This 23% revenue gain would have been an acceleration of revenue gains over q1  13% revenue growth. Not sure how this could have happened unless the Iphone X really was supply constrained in q1 and then people bought a huge number in q2. All in all I think Apple's guidance has been pretty good as a basis to understand whether the company is growing in revenue or not. Better than most analysts. After all they get to see how things are actually doing.,

What will happen with Comcast and Time Warner as co-owners of Hulu (that crucial ""grownup content"" part of the triumvirate)? I don't see that relationship surviving for long. How fast will DIS go global, considering global is crucial to streaming success?Too many open questions right now. This could take years to shake out. Meanwhile, NFLX and AMZN have a free hand to take over the world.

"I'm long HCA, but this article doesn't even scratch the surface on a number of challenges HCA (and hospital operators in general) is facing.  On one hand, you've got health insurers like UHG pushing more volume to out-patient facilities (read lower margin) while also acquiring their own physician/urgent care networks.  You've got payer mix shifting more towards Medicare and away from Managed Care which results in lower reimbursement for HCA.  You also have wage inflation as HCA looks to limit nurse turnover and recruit physicians (who aren't cheap...).  HCA's long-term structural margin challenges have nothing to do with the recent hurricane season... You don't even mention the ~$32B of net debt on the balance sheet.  You could legitimately write entire articles about each of the challenges I mentioned above (and a handful I haven't even mentioned).  That being said, I do think HCA is the best positioned for-profit hospital operator, but before investing I had to get comfortable with all of the above risk factors.Further complicating matters, the valuation is nowhere near as attractive as you make it seem.350.1M shares outstanding x $101 share price = ~$35B market cap.$32B net debt + $35B market cap = $67B enterprise value.  Net debt is 48% of enterprise value...I calculate $2.4B of FCF in 2017 ($5.4 cash from ops less $3B of capex).  $2.4B FCF/$67B enterprise value = a 3.5% free cash flow yield.The tax law will significantly help, but given increased capex in FY18 and the newly declared dividend, I'm also anticipating lower share repurchases in the near-term.  I'm in for the long-term, but I've got a lot riding on management opportunistically deploying capital via well-timed acquisitions and/or repurchases in order for HCA to provide reasonable returns over the next decade.",

"Do you not weigh valuation in your analysis?  I think your assessment will prove too optimistic.  (I see the last trade on your $5.25 call options buy was $4.25, so I have the benefit of almost a month hindsight in saying this.). Their TTM P/E is not all that meaningful, but their Forward P/E is still about 33% premium to the Pharma average and their PEG is trading at about 17% discount to their own 5-year average, but a 70% premium to the Pharma industry.  Growth can explain some of that premium - but all, I’m not sure.  I’m no BMY bear, or it wouldn’t be my single largest position as it is.  But I only own shares, so no time constraint, and I’ll be perfectly happy if it takes them 2-years to appreciate 17%, and collect a decent dividend along the way.

"( The other 2 cold stacked rigs are worthless scrap, RVT says value below 10 million.)",
"Neo,don't write off RDC too early. The aramco deal brings gigantic backlog mid-term and their fleet is one of the youngest.Plus, out of 16 stacked rigs, only 4 are cold stacked. And two of them were bought recently, so they did not decide to stack them. The rest is warm stacked. That means they can restart operations nearly immediately at minimum cost - that is a huge advantage. Compare this to RIG or ESV with their large fleet of ""ready-stacked"" vessels which still require around $ 30 to $ 50 million dollar to reactivate.",
"Great work by ESV Team of course. I have known and commented on Ensco 8500 series and marketability in struggling times for day rates, because of its efficiency and lesser Opex cost to operate a non-self propelled vessel. Jackup contracts are at or less than their previous contract rates (except for that Netherland renewal), But I still believe their ER would be par below RIG and expected to post considerable reduction in FCF from previous quarters, because of my theory of those contracts being a cash drain. If my theory holds good, every increase in Ensco and RIG contract accumulation in successive quarters will test the actual value vs market cap of RDC and DO. Because RDC and DO enjoyed the premium gains just because of their cash positions, but now without comparable contract gains and losing Tier 1 status to RIG and ESV, the FSR of RDC and DO will be bleak for many more quarters to follow and while cash premium didn't mean much to DO and RDC. Again the key is the recovery timeline. If the recovery happens quick, RIG and ESV enjoy while DO and RDC suffer.If my theory holds good, RIG IMO is a great report both FSR and beat expectations better than ESV and NE. So, RIG ++ve, NE (seems like +ve but not that impressive), ESV +ve on the contracts, but still waiting for their FCF risk position. As always, DO and RDC slowing and painfully lose their premium they enjoyed in 2017 and might fall unless market recovery slow things down. Waiting for ESV and RDC earning releases. I am thinking there will be another dip to $58 oil, while refinery shutdown through end of march. And there is not that much reason for this rise from $58 to $63. This is one of my moments that I once mentioned in my strategy for entry/exit, where facts don't add up while OPEC export diversion and WTI vs Brent convergence and along with increasing production beyond their limits (Nigeria and Libya) may worsen the case going forward in March. Again, I am sticking to my original timeline for recovery, this jump from $58 to $63 doesn't have legs.",
"I am not going to turn bullish overnight. I am still bearish, but sudden strategy shift by RIG should be welcomed by the shareholders. If they just did that to satisfy the shareholders before ER, I would doubt that. It is a statement to the industry that we did our part for scrapping ""it is time for others to bear the torch and march forward"" That sure explains DO's frustration in their ER call about RIG's underbid marketing strategy. DO's statement overshadowed RIG's aggressive marketing strategy to generate FCF than losing moonneyy$$$. I bet RIG sure didn't underbid themselves to prove anything to shareholders, they should have their reason to secure contracts while their cost efficiency was improving since they unloaded their jack-up fleet. 4Q results are just the beginning of troubling times for other OSD. Their OPEX cost metrics and overhead charges were reduced to all-time low. Their proven asset management strategy with high-quality workforce picked during primetime of recovery should be a warning sign for DO and other drillers, that they can churn butter from the water. I know I need to wait for 3Q results for these new contracts to post tangible revenue for breakeven cost calculation, but knowing TOI strategy for years, they are not that kind who would underbid for loss. Real questions - how long DO, RDC, NE and possibly ESV could post bleak FSR while losing bid to RIG in the harsh environment?  For anyone who wants to invest in OSDs, RIG should be in your portfolio. For ESV, DO, RDC, NE, I would cautiously wait for the momentum build.",
"RIG harsh environment strength would compensate for their lack of jackup exposure. I think management had got atleast few things right for short term recovery and Songa deal, which was previously thought to be a long term one (without their jackup fleet). I think when they focus on one specific segment (know it or not jackup vs deepwater support needs are different), you could have cost efficiency with resource planning, spares, supply chain, inventory control, onshore support needs above all consolidation of the regional workforce. RIG if they tighten their screws, they could squeeze and become more efficient forward, wherein ESV need an army of team to support jackup fleet, mid water, non-self propelled and drillships (both shorebased support, projects team and operations)",
"Good job, FT.In previous reports you had indicated that you had bonds of de RIG and ESV. As you do not point out now, I consult you if you consider them good investment and continue with them.Best regards",
"That is a good question. But the real questions are who would post profit sooner than other. What their market cap would be then compared to the levels today. ESV and RIG had set their path for aggressive strategy vs DO, RDC and NE(by no choice). If day rates improve to sustainable levels by 3Q-4Q (along with aggressive scrapping), expect RIG/ESV/RDC (because of jackup segment recovery and harsh environment rigs, mid-water semi-sub and ultra-deepwater DS market) to post decent gains from the impressive deepwater fleet by 4Q at the earliest. Believe me, market cap would have shot to the moon by then. They are down at 1/10 of their 2013/14 marketcap.",
Fun: When do you think RIG can produce a profit?,
FT - good update as usual.  Fully agree this is an impressive amount of contracting activity.   I liked NE’s report on balance but pales in activity to the RIG report.   That said my sense is they are repeatedly the low bidder particularly in GOM.  Hope that we start to see increasing day rates at some point as supply tightens.  GLTA,
"Impairment charges are a force of nature in this business when assets were forced to retire with residual value loss on their book. But RIG, ESV by just looking at the asset book value even after rigorous scrapping won't fear competition against DO, RDC and NE. During good times if you were to compare their asset book value, that is a good indication of where each driller had stood then. That has not changed much now when DO begin sending cold stacked assets to graveyard soon. IMO. RIG/ESV will be strong as ever and will sense their competition mile away and can make their FSR go empty for an entire year. But that is not they wanted and would like this consolidation to be over soon. Yet, RDC's test (though have some of best in class harsh environment assets) against ESV's/Borr jackup fleet still remains.",
FT: nice job. on a nostalgic note - BOY - do I miss the1995-1998 period when these OSD's shotto the moon !!! .....,
Thanks FT for great article. Your views on Esv? To me it seems ESV May give higher returns than RIG in next two years just because it has dipped too much. What’s your take on that FT?,
"In theory, RIG could burn through it's 12 billion in backlog faster than another company with 3 billion in backlog. The questions are can RIG make any money off of the backlog and can it run the clock down on competitors? At what point will a monopoly red flag be raised? Accumulate both - be wise. NE and RIG. IMHO",
"What, no technical analysis?  Who ever kidnapped FT and replace him with a clone, bring him back.Marvelous work as usual, Fun! Thank you!",
"Good Evening Fun, thanks for the update. I am very excited about ESV's FSR and their Q4 earings report, too. Hope their FSR will show as much activity.",

"Well written article, thanks for all the research and insight.",
"HmmmI am not suggesting that anything ""illegal"" took place here.The devil is always in the details. And this ""deal"" has so many that it is nearly impossible to see the forest for the trees. (actual benefits to related parties) But one thing immediately jumped out as I read the article: a fixed 70:1 silver gold exchange rate. In my opinion, that alone should have been enough to nix the deal.  But hey, it is obvious that Primero's shareholders were sold down the river a long time ago. This new ""deal"" is more of the same. Basically this is yet another sterling example in a long, long line whereby the original share holders of a valuable mining company slowly but surely see their equity stolen out from under them by shady management ""deals"" that always end up favoring ""the other guy"".......My all time favorite is GBG-Great Basin gold- which was sitting on one of the largest gold deposits in the world conservatively worth billions. By the time management was finished, GBG share holders were literally left holding hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid recently acquired debt and worthless shares and not much more. Meanwhile, that mine which had been brought to the brink of production and then shut down, ended up being sold twice in rapid succession. The first time to a company run by a recent director of GBG for less about 75 Million.  He then almost immediately turned it around and sold it for 200 Million to its current owners....And yes, insiders made a small fortune through all the machination. Sounds kind of familiar doesn't. Of course, this didn't happen overnight, it did take a couple of years. But similar stories litter the history of gold/silver miners going back a hundred+ years.

Thanks so much for the article Somabull. Information you've provided makes it possible for me to make decisions going forward as I have holdings in both PPP and AG.,
"Thanks, Somabull. One point remains unclear to me: why did AG management decided to pay so much, including the huge re-negotiation fee? If Primero was struggling why not let it go under and then buy the assets?",
Thank you for the article; woah what happened to primero?? I used to have it when it was $7 or $8 and it feels a long time ago; so AG buys this mine after MUX buys the Black Fox assets in the Timmins for 6 cents on the $; I was hoping that MUX would buy this mine but after reading this article I am glad it did not happen,
"Great information and I really appreciate SomaBull for taking the effort to prepare and share with us here in SeekingAlpha. I have been a shareholder of Primero (PPPMF) and before reading this Article I had made up my mind of keeping my Primero shares waiting for them to be exchanged to AG shares, rather than selling PPPMF shares at the ongoing low rate.",
Excellent article.  I went in on AG after seeing the stock take a beating and loving the Primero take over.,
Thanks for a very thorough analysis of before and after scenario.,
"Somabull, thank you for the extended information on the Primero acquisition, which along with other previous SA articles on FM, really clarifies the risk/reward picture for this project. Also liked the extended risk conversation and the honesty regarding FM's problems in execution on there other projects - refreshing to hear these points discussed. We are told that management and resources, along with region, are the most important factors for precious metals miners. FM seems to have 2 of 3 in their favor, while you; however, seem to have some reservations on management execution moving forward. Now that the company has loaded up on resources and will have several solid mines in production, what, if anything, leads you to believe their execution will be better going forward? If an investor is looking to put $10k into a primary silver producer (assume by that I mean me), is FM a legitimate option or are there other companies you think offer more predictable solid returns in 2018?I have a lot of risk tolerance in this sector, and am watching that gold silver ratio closely, so I can accept substantial  risk (financial, regional, management) but also don't want to throw away money needlessly if I can purchase profits with less risk. One of the other risks of FM is silver market price - some of their mines don't look very good unless silver pops a couple of bucks and then they become much more interesting. Another way to look at this is their AISC overall are significantly higher than San Dimas and Santa Elena mines alone indicate, and their production targets may come under pressure until silver bumps up to more realistic valuations, given historical prices. Who knows how long that will take!I have made some investments in explorers and juniors, now looking at more mature companies and might rather put money into royalty/streamers Wheaton or Sandstorm than the producers, if the producers risks are too volatile to estimate. Like a lot of other investors in this space, I am looking to balance risk versus reward by having a few consistent producers in the portfolio in addition to the riskier explorers.",

"On the December 1st conference call, management indicated that corporate expenses (salaries, R&D, management, advertising, etc.) should top out at CAD $2.5-3.0M going forward. While I think this may be a tad low, it does seem to support a very high EBITDA margin, especially since the company has indicated a gross margin of at least 85% going forward.In your valuation model, on one hand, you've assumed a much lower EBITDA margin based on competition heating up at some point in the future (perhaps a few years from now). On the other hand, you haven't allowed for much higher run rate subscription revenue, which the company should be able to garner prior to competition heating up (perhaps a few years from now).That mismatch seems to me like a valuation error. In other words, for the first perhaps 100-300k (?) patients, the EBITDA margin should be very high, followed by a gradual reduction for future patients as competition heats up. That should allow for much higher profitability going forward than your model projects. Do you see my point?",

Thanks for the article and great write up. I agree with your take on the company in that this one is set for growth but entry at the right price is needed. Can you please check if the CEO salary you are quoting above is quarterly or annual? I believe it is quarterly however that probably gives them a few more points on EBITDA%. Your point on R&D and marketing still stands.Look forward to owning this one in the future.,
Nice to see the company getting coverage on SA. Thanks for the article.

"Fair analysis of where the company stands today. Obviously, the share price appreciation is building future growth in to the stock's valuation. I feel with a growth stock like this... there are certain intangible that need to also carry weight. 1) CEO stated last year in Jan that on boarding will begin in Jul/Aug - Turned out to be true2) CEO stated that they will be breaking even by end of the year - Issued a press releasing claiming profitability in Dec 2017.Those factors to me carry weight, she was able to deliver on her promises to the investor and now the question is can they execute and potentially increase subscribers. As you mentioned... the EBITDA margin number is anyone's guess. It really depends on how much R&D Reliq believes is necessary to be pumped in to the business, although the CEO has explicitly stated that the company has built its platform and does not expect extensive R&D to be required in the near future; the EBITDA margins may well be a lot higher than 25%. The question as you pointed out is that if this model is as successful as the stock appreciation makes you believe it is... competition will increase and the space/margins/revenue potential will be squeezed. Either Reliq stays ahead of the curve by investing more capital ($$$'s) or is able to secure more contracts that makes it a viable acquisition target.",

"Apple is not going to introduce a 6.1"" LED iPhone, period.  Such a device would compete directly against the iPhone X (pronounced iPhone TEN) family of handsets and by necessity (keep price down) would entail a much larger form factor (additional engineering expense) than does current Plus iPhones.  Not going to happen.This year Apple is going to introduce only one new iPhone X.  It will be a Plus size in current Plus form factor.The current iPhone X will be carried through FY2019 at a reduced price of $899 and $1049.  The Plus sized iPhone will be priced at $999 and $1149.This pricing schema fills an empty price tier at $899 for the base model iPhone.Apple will also introduce iPhone 9 and iPhone 9 Plus.  This is important because the OLED version of iPhone is labeled iPhone X pronounced iPhone TEN.The FY2019 pricing schema described above will appear to be a price reduction, when in fact it will raise ASPs even further without further price increases.

I believe Apple will cut the number of phones it sells. They released the X all other phones before it are dead. They can’t migrate the software to embrace the X while still selling the dead phones. It will make it easier to migrate away from the home button if they offer less of the old phones in 2018 and beyond. It also simplified the supply chain.",
"i think apple has a ""we dont need poor people"" attitude in the decision makers circle, so my prognostication is that Apple  drops the entry level and ASP goes up over the next two years with the release of even pricier iphones.

"Why not SE2 for $2,000, iPhone 9 for $5,000 and iPhone XI for $10,000? It will benefit the ASP a lot. For a business person $100,000 iPhone is still a good investment, if Android is hacked the loss may be 1-3 orders of magnitude higher.Where is the limit? Is there a limit since Apple is now a monopoly?Just one quarter ago it looked like there was a limit. Microsoft could return to mobile any time. Android was fixing the updates problem, also erroneously called fragmentation, with Project Treble and Android One. But now? Microsoft killed Windows S and the last reason to go UWP with it. Microsoft cancelled push notifications to old Windows phones, they do not want to pay for leftovers of a single Azure server and a part timer necessary to keep that running. No U-turn possible for Microsoft now. Google killed Android One, updates will not come directly from Google. They will come from the wonderful hardware vendors, the same vendors who sabotage Treble still releasing new, damn it, NEW, phones on Android 7.So, Apple can do whatever they want. The moat, or better say the abyss between the Apple crowd and the Android crowd, remains intact. And for those who will miss SE there are plenty of untethered Watch, a nice companion to their iPad.",
"I think Apple just signed a deal with Wistron in India to manufacture a new SE or other entry level phone, as far as I am aware, to ensure they have a highly spec’d entry-level model available in markets which aren’t ready for mass uptake of the more expensive models.

How much would you value Skouries and Olympics phase III? something between 0 $ and 2000 $ million ?, and kisladag ?. I have valued what I know of the company, kisladag with its current production, Olimpyas phase II with its production, Efemcukuru, Lamaque and the rest of the projects. That is, a company that will produce about 400K oz this year and 500K next year (EGO has $ 120 million to start up Lamaque) with an AISC of less than 900 $ oz and all that for $ 900 million of capitalization.

"What is your point, gater? You stir a pot of crock to make a bear out of nonsauce? It's the pioneers who get all the arrows. I'm reminded of the Stanley Steamer advocates and electric car builders who railed with the same level of pointless arrows about the gas buggy competition....Steam-powered and electric cars outsold gasoline-powered ones in many US states prior to the invention of the electric starter, since internal combustion cars relied on a hand crank to start the engine, which was difficult and occasionally dangerous to use, as improper cranking could cause a backfire capable of breaking the arm of the operator. Electric cars were popular to some extent but had a short range, and could not be charged on the road if the batteries ran low......Assembly-line mass production by Henry Ford dramatically reduced the cost of owning a conventional automobile, was also a strong factor in the steam car's demise as the Model T was both cheap and reliable. Additionally, during the 'heyday' of steam cars, the internal combustion engine made steady gains in efficiency, matching and then surpassing the efficiency of a steam engine when the weight of a boiler is factored in......With the introduction of the electric starter, the internal combustion engine became more popular than steam, but the internal combustion engine was not necessarily superior in performance, range, fuel economy and emissions. Some steam enthusiasts feel steam has not received its share of attention in the field of automobile efficiency...Excerpts from http://bit.ly/1LQ5fNHThe U.S. Government has always thrown money at new and bearish ideas.

"Good article... I am currently (as of Monday) long MDXG based on the news, otherwise a channel/modified swing trader of MDXG. I was fortunate to be elsewhere when this news broke. However, on the news, I bought twice and have an average position at 9:06. For my part I have no trouble putting additional eggs into the MDXG basket at this level.  My take on the MXDG anomaly: If you recall from the Cohodes information and the rebuttal on the MDXG site, a general claim exists that an Insider is passing information to Cohodes from MDXG. I believe that information [as stated by both parties] to be all but confirmed. That said, no Sam, you should not just brush off any information AKA “evidence” obtained from internal documents. It is prudent however to judge as best as you can the veracity of the ""evidence"" until it's either verified as Cohodes claims or mitigated as MiMedx claims. I believe the Harold Purdy retractions to be significant as they may have influenced Cohodes' stirrings. I believe young companies are disproportionately subject to accounting irregularities that don't necessarily have  fraudulent genesis. This is the wild card that adds risk to the MDXG equation at this point in the trade. (makes for a speculative trade) My take on the company is related to the technology. MDXG is top of space with limited competition and near-unlimited opportunities for medical application. I have no concern about the company losing market share if there are account irregularities because it has nothing to do with the validity of the applied technology. The doctors who are using the product are not going to look at shizzle and drama, they will however continue to expand the application of the MDXG products. Read the comment from 4Fang; that comment is key and central to the MDXG story because it is the factual confirmation of evidence-based medical application. It's the stuff of the future and MDXG is on the leading edge of that expansion. The books are probably not 100% clean but they're also not as problematic as the Harold Purdy inspired Cohodes reverse pump & dump manipulation campaign is suggesting. Cohodes simply used insider information to animate doubt and bolster/extend his own short opportunities, hoping to force a back-door downgrade. His activities are against the law BTW. I think any negative conclusion resulting from the ""prior years"" reference is mitigated by the expansion of valid technologies and applications. Unless there is massive fraud (which I predict will not be discovered), MDXG will recover nicely to trade at a premium to its value. Borderbandit... I think on special situations like this one, you can't rely too heavily on go-to chart signals. The unknowns trump the logic that you'd normally apply. Chart formations are interesting and occasionally can assist a decision but not when the underlying issue is so completely irregular. It would be interesting however to run a test and see if this is the case in other words, does your typical charting formations actually give you any actionable data on which you can effectuate a confident trade. MDXG may well be range bound for a few weeks or so, I will take advantage of that gentle roll while it lasts and otherwise monitor the news. An interesting note: trading volume on 2/21 was half that of 2/20 and the range was tighter. I am interested to learn what the charts “say” in the coming 7 trading days or so.

Volatility of the stock creates good covered call opportunity. Selling Mar $7.50 call for $1.67 and buying stock at $8.71 for a net of $7.04 opens a position with downside protection and the opportunity for a return of $.46 on $7.04 investment (6.5% in a month). You have to like the stock for the long term as you might end up having to hold it if the news is bad and the stock gets punished and driven below $7.04. Hopefully the guidance doesn't  change and the entry at $7.04 becomes a good trade.,

I do like their dividend, too, which I hope is safe and sustainable. That alone could make me take a mini-plunge along with the suppressed stock price. I first found them when I was doing some due diligence on companies involved in robotics. I continue to wonder with that low price whether they could be a take-out candidate, too.

It does sound like Omeros will pursue it with new P2 data that will come in mid-2018.  I wish he would have explicitly said they were denied because he knew that as a fact during yesterday's call.

Well, the batteries are a drop in the ocean. You simply can’t solve the problem by storing renewable generation with batteries.

Interesting look at this aspect of Tesla’s business. But what is left out is any analysis of the profitability of the power and storage business.

"Yep, author, it definitely is just you.Your charts, alone, show that DAL is reducing outstanding shares while maintaining income, and enjoying notable SP appreciation over a 5-year period.Even ignoring the dividends paid over that period of time, that equates to value creation.AND, that value increase is being accomplished, basically, regardless of the price of oil.And THAT is also a positive which I don't believe you acknowlege as such.Your comment ""Two years ago, Delta stock was right about where it's at now"" not only ignores the above, but also ignores the fact that if a wise investor DRIPed and bought on dips during that period of time, then THEY created substantial value within their own portfolio.Toss a few basic, conservative numbers into a DCF calculator, and you might discover that the stock is currently undervalued by around about, oh, 30%, too.So....what other cyclical industries should we ignore?",
"Watching this little tit for tat is fun, but consider that markets are made up of participants on both sides.  With respect to the airlines very smart people have made large bets and others have remained on the sidelines.  I'm a month into the research and can't figure out which way I lean.  I remain intrigued though.  Don Cox once said something to the effect that ""the greatest returns are in asset classes where the insiders are most scared because they have been burned in the past.""

Great article Michael. Keep it up.,
Very insightful and fun read!!,
"There are some significant factual exclusions and/or outdated information. 1.  Other than American, which did an out of court bankruptcy in 2003 and then spent much of the next decade with inflated costs, no other airlines in the class of DAL went thru bankruptcy after Delta and Northwest.  Using the example of much smaller airlines as evidence of instability is stretching.  AAL, DAL, LUV and UAL control 80% of the US market - which is certainly considered an oligopoly in most people's books.  2.  The US government just reached an agreement with Qatar - one of the two countries that Delta and other US airlines accuse of subsidizing their airlines - to follow international accounting guidelines and disclose government subsidies within two years.  The US government continues to work with the UAE but there are plenty of indications that the subsidized Middle East model isn't working and the governments can't continue to subsidize their airlines with the only real benefit of providing cheap air fares to millions of passengers that simply connect thru the Middle East.  Pricing in the US-India market is the biggest impacted by the Middle East airlines.  DAL has said it is exploring a return to India and has much stronger partnerships there than it did when it served it before.3.  DAL is the most profitable airline in the world right now among a US airline industry which is currently best in the world.  While the stock has not been growing as much as some other companies, an accurate comparison is to old line industrials and consumer companies which include GE and a host of brick and mortar retailers and many of those companies' stock has done much worse than DAL.  If you don't like DAL, you just don't want anything to do with airlines. Period.  The only airline whose stock has done better on a consistent basis and will likely continue to do so is LUV.  DAL and LUV were at the top of the US airline industry in 4th quarter financials.  4.  DAL challenged Boeing, one of the two western global airframe manufacturers in DAL's order of Bombardier's C Series.  The ITC sided with Bombardier.  DAL is widely reported to have received an outstanding deal for at least 75 and likely 50 additional aircraft and in the process inserted a third western manufacturer in the mainline commercial market.  The statement that DAL doesn't have the negotiating power to obtain the discounts on aircraft that it should is completely counter to actual facts.  5.  Given that DAL has a double digit system unit revenue advantage to its US peers, it can hardly be said that DAL's product is a commodity.  Given that DAL's margins are above average margins are heavily driven by its revenue advantage and its guidance is for continued unit revenue growth, it is very likely that its margins will expand.I'll stop there but the article is more about historical and jilted investor sentiment than about  actual and current facts and data about DAL or the US legacy segment of the industry - or more importantly, forward-looking information that could help investors make decisions about DAL.",
"Very well written article.Airlines certainly are a different animal for investors, huge cash flow and tiny margins.  Delta, and the other large airlines have brought back their profit margins with disciplined capacity growth, in the case of Delta, never more than GDP growth.  United's recent ""shot over the bow"" is definitely cause for concern.As is often told in the Airline industry, ""how do you become a millionaire? Start with a billion and invest in an Airline"".  Let's hope that United doesn't again prove the validity of this parable.I agree its time to be cautious, especially in the Airline industry.",

"This is cute, I guess. But none of this is analysis. It is parlor-room style chatting, or some other kind of amusement. I also love the dismissive link to the 2016 10-K for info about SkyMiles. Newsflash: >$1 billion of free cash flow earned at a 50% margin, growing double digits, and requiring zero incremental capital is not a bad business and not immaterial to a company of this size. Beyond that, this article also fails in its attempt at valuation. Valuation involves the estimation of cash flows -- real cash -- from here until judgment day, discounted back at a proper rate. The author doesn't even try to do that, hiding instead behind empty multiples. This article does a great job of highlighting the psychological shortcomings of many investors, but not in the way the author intended. Sad.",
Loved the article; costs are too high and too much competition.,
"you said, ""Let’s go back to the time period around Delta’s last bankruptcy – 2005."".  That seems to infer that they have had more than one.  They have only had one bankruptcy in there over 90 year history.",
"could not agree more. Owned DAL until Dec/17. Came out OK (avg share price 36, sold half of holdings at 51/56) but frustrating as it did little last 2 yrs (as article shows) and during low fuel costs years. Too many other better choices for stock pickers.",
"Great article.  In a bid-up market it's all too easy to grab up one of the few ""value plays"".  And Warren's approval almost obviates the need to do the numbers.  But still no Free Lunch......(OK, so, er, long DAL)",

"And just today I saw a story that Delta's pilots were considering a push to restore their pensions which were terminated in bankruptcy.  Another late cycle cost pressure airlines face is their seniority based (and, therefore, low turnover) workforce seeking to restore wages and benefits to historical peaks.

"Funded capacity is definitely something to consider when evaluating the long term prospects of a Canadian LP, but licensed capacity is where the rubber meets the road. As we have seen in Colorado, three or fours years into recreational legalization the price of marijuana starts to drop as massive scales begin to drive down prices.LICENSED CAPACITY (as of February 16, 2018):Canopy: 20,650 KGOrganigram: 16,500 KG Aurora: 8,800 KGAphria: 9,000 KGMedReleaf: 12,600 KGOf course, all the big players will point to early 2019 as when they are anticipated to finish building their massive grow operations. To believe that these dates are attainable, one would have to dismiss the thought of construction delays, permit delays, inspection delays or weather delays. Its not easy to build in the winter in Canada. Even if they are able to overcome these obstacles, what we are left with is waiting for Health Canada to approve these facilities for licensed capacity. It has taken Health Canada, on average, at least two months to license a facility that sends in their application and videos for expansion approval. So, if all the big players are able to get their applications and videos into Health Canada by January 1,2019, that means that they will be licensed to grow by March 1,2019.After the companies are licensed to grow, then they will start to plant their crops to harvest in 3-4 months. So, we are looking at around June 15, 2019 before these big players are bringing in these massive quantities into the market. Estimating that the recreational market is up and running on August 15, 2018, that means it will be 10 months before any of the large players are able to bring scale to the market.Moreover, Organigram’s expansion plans are to increase to 25,000 KG by the end of May 2018. With a 2-3 month wait time for Health Canada approval, in August of 2019 Organigram will become the largest licensed capacity producer in Canada.What does the first mover advantage bring to the table? It makes sure that the provinces or private retailers that decide to sign Letters of Intent with Organigram will have sufficient supply to satiate the market.",

"FSIO, another great article.  I can't help but think that you're too measured, calm, and without a grinding axe to be short a ""story"" stock.  But regardless, your articles are always a pleasure.Bears (despite most of them persistently crying wolf) were absolutely correct in their FSD skepticism.  And you in particular.A few points on the way out --1.  To note:  Tesla is not using an NN to drive, but rather for image recognition only.  This is based on data from those with root access to the car's software.  A driving NN may come later, but it's not currently in the field.2.  Musk made great points about those needing to rely on super-accurate HD maps to perform self-driving.  He's not wrong about this possibly achieving a local maxima.  Nor is he wrong that Tesla clearly chose the more difficult short-term path.  Nor, of course, can he predict any future timeline to save his life ...3.  And keep in mind that one could also interview any random TSLA message board heckler and come up with equal (or likely worse) generalizations or misunderstandings.  Read the SpaceX satellite internet thread to marvel in some unintentional but enduring comedic efforts.  (Remember to tip your waitress)4.  The ties between SpaceX and Tesla aren't as simple as your friend imagines, but they're also far more complex than most give credit.  Musk's other heroics not only drive Tesla business (re: energy storage), but also drive Tesla investments (re: stock and other financial offerings).  In simple terms, his other ventures and mythos give Tesla a ""long runway"" for take-off.  Far longer than most around here believe.  And longer than most seem to be betting via option hedges.Cheers.",

Great article.Well done.Thank you.,
"FundamentalSpeculation...Thanks for an interesting and informative view on Tesla's future.  Full disclosure:  I am a Model S owner but I swing trade the stock.  In my opinion, holding TSLA long term either short or long is a risky idea. I have a few quibbles, but overall I thought your analysis iwas fair.  Now for the quibbles.  First of all we really don't know what agreements Tesla has with its vendors.  We don't know what the gross profit will be when the Model 3 hits 5,000 per week production.  We don't know by how much production capacity can be speeded up.  We don't know what Tesla's battery pack costs are.  We don't know how big the utiltiy scale energy storage market will be, we don't know if Tesla can build the Semi in the price range listed or provide the rapid charging as stated.  So it's hard to be definitive in placing a value on TSLA.Second quibble:  Of course Tesla gamed the demo of the self driving car in 2016.  Just like Waymo games their self driving cars in a geo-fenced 10 square mile area in Arizona.  No car made yet has Level 4 capability for driving anywhere in the country under any weather condition.third quibble:  It is obvious that Musk is not your ordinary CEO.  To many people who short the stock he  is the devil incarnate.  But if you follow his track record, he is always pushing to extend the limits of what people and technology can achieve.  He comes off as an eccentric, but he gets things done that other people think can't be achieved. The fact that he attempts more things than can be achieved is more positive than negative.I don't know if Tesla will survive or not, but I don't see any serious competition for up to five years due to the lack of infrastructure for competitors, meaning batteries, superchargers, the profit structure of auto dealers, and major investments in ICE manufactuing.",

"Well, interesting article. I would call myself a modest tesla bull in that I have a long position that is slightly less than 5% of my portfolio and I have not been adverse to selling covered calls and other trading manouvers that have enhanced my return. But I have to quibble with your (and I guess Mike's) opening thesis: I think wall street by and large understands technology very well, which is why the company has been given such a generous valuation. Trying to value the company based on its peers seems fruitless, because the company, for good or bad has no peers. Instead it is given an innovation premium, similar to how Amazon was valued. And Netflix and Facebook.    I wouldn't call the often heated arguments between bulls and nears 'tribal' exactly, but I would call them biased. Most bears do not want Tesla to succeed, irrespective of how much money they have bet, because of inherent political or other fixed opinions in how the world should be. Similarly, many bulls are bulls because they want Tesla to succeed, or, as is my case, because I drive a Tesla and really like the car.    Finally I must point out something I frequently mention when I read a short article: I do not believe that an unhedged short position in Tesla is safe sport; You are one headline away from a bigtime squeeze. Or, put another way,  something many are familiar with: The market can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent",
"<<So what happens when there's a delay in production? Well, as per the agreement, the payment still has to be made in X days. Whether the company is able to build the finished product and sell it to a customer is the company's problem, not the supplier's. >>All very logical and probably correct..bit this is the beginning of a vendor/Tesla relationship that is supposed to last for years and involve 500,000 or more cars.   I'm sure that Tesla - seeing the production delays in October - began delaying purchase orders for parts to thirty or sixty days later..   I don't see that the problem is significant yet.   It would be far far worse, if Tesla had been building at 4000/week and then had to halt production because of a failure in the battery pack line..then the parts would have accumulated very rapidly..",

"Most timely report, and  listening to Mark Hurd at Goldman Sachs Conference on Feb 15th, it seems they'll grow well in IAAS.",
"I think that ORCL are conflicted as to which strategy they want to follow in cloud.  Originally they focussed on SaaS which is the highest margin are by actively moving their existing Applications customers to Cloud and by inventing the reps to only sell SaaS with some reps not getting commission for On Premise licence sales while getting big bonuses for SaaS sales.  They then realised that many customers want the rest of their IT in the same cloud as their SaaS solution because many of the peripheral applications communicate with the main SaaS applications.  This led to a push for IaaS.  Unfortunately this puts them into direct competition with AMZN AWS, MSFT Azure and GOOGL cloud.  AWS and Azure are very rich offerings with hundreds of options. ORCL IaaS is fast but lacks all the extra options.  No single customer will buy all of the options but any single customer will want the options that are important to them.  Trying to keep up with AMZN is really hard with several products t announcements per week!  In the area of PaaS ORCL are managing a delicate balancing act by trying to preserve on premise support revenues from database customers while promoting PaaS to new customers.  Also the ORCL Hardware reps are conflicted with their natural desire to keep selling hardware to IT staff who feel comfortable running their own hardware.  The Servers and Storage in the market these days are excellent performance and quality.  The ORCL specific hardware solutions are much faster than generic hardware offered in the Cloud by ORCL and competitors.  NB There are many arguments to move to Cloud but sheer performance is not one of them. My personal opinion is that ORCL will end up with a IaaS platform that is good enough for customers who are using major ORCL SaaS applications.  I doubt they will challenge the big 3 for non ORCL customers IaaS workloads,PS there are a lot of people running ORCL and SQL databases on AMZN AWS today.",

"IaaS may be important short term, particularly with hybrid scenarios as customers migrate systems but PaaS will be where the real growth is long term. With IaaS I still need the same IT resources as I need with on premise with the difference simply being there is no local servers. PaaS is disruptive in that it eliminates most of the IT resource requirements to manage the servers and greatly accelerates the development/deployment life cycle. PaaS is still in it's early stages but within several years it will dominate the cloud revenue stream led by AWS and Azure.",

I bought FTV at the spin off and have been a huge advocate for it over DHR from the day it happens to now. Stop looking at FTV from and earnings perspective and pay attention to FCF. Capital allocators are about FCF and should be valued as such. Looking at PE will cause investors to miss out on stocks like FTV all too often. AME is a similar story. I sold a bunch which was a mistake but maintained a healthy weight of behind FTV. Same story. Brilliant Capital allocators. Buy and hold them until the allocators themselves wither price they aren’t good at it anymore or they leave and the bench isn’t deep. For FTV and AME the benches are deep and the caches are quite young.,
"It's asset light, sticky, higher margin...look at Roper.",
My view is DHR & ROK are of superior investment quality...although FTV has a small dividend and retains more cash.,
i got some FTV for free. happy camper!,
"Yes, absolutely a buy.  You should expect similar performance to this going forward.Fortive is a smaller, nimbler version of it’s former parent, Danaher.  My wife used to work for Fortive when it was stilled owned by DHR.  They have a relentless focus on margin, cash flow and a culture of continuous improvement (Danaher/Fortive Business System).  It can be quite a shock for a newly acquired company once the corporate shock troops come in for FBS deployment.  A lot of complacent clock puncher types cannot cut the new culture and quit.  That works well for FTV because they would have otherwise let those workers go as they massively improve the productivity of the newly acquired assets.Anyway, now FTV can continue to focus on these smaller, often private acquisitions as the author mentions.  The new market cap allows a few of these to move the EPS needle over a intermediate time period.  Warren Buffett had been on the record stating that he laments how big Berkshire has gotten at times, because the current market cap isn’t moved easily by small and medium acquisitions.  What DHR did was take action and created two smaller companies who can pursue this strategy for far longer into the future as separate entities in their own markets as opposed to one big conglomerate.  I applaud them for this and other companies should take note.  I’m looking at you EMR!!!Long DHR and FTV and formally long EMR as well as an ex-employee of EMR.",

"Much has been written and commented on previous tariffs such as with Bush in 2002. It’s also been mentioned that the Bush tariffs had an overall negative effect on the steel industry pricing long term. My question is, what effect did those tariffs have on mill closures around the world? Did it hasten them? Did it in turn add strength to subsidized Chinese steel mills? I guess I’m wondering more macro on the world scene than just US. My thoughts swirl around South Korean steel suddenly having a large barrier for their industry and they have to cut back due to capacity and production issues making it no viable to keep mills open, and then the Chinese filling the gap. It wouldn’t be overnight but I’m wondering how many countries this scenario plays out in. Something interesting to watch",
"Wait until all of that Chinese steel gets dumped into the markets of their Asian neighbors! Wars have literally started because of this behavior. It's ironic that (if these recommendations are implemented) choking off the market for foreign steel within the US could result in the collapse of the frail Asian steel companies that have enjoyed dumping into the US market. The outcome could literally be that the United States will once again be the last man standing as the major global steel producer. What form would domestic steel take in the United States? I don't think that we will see the large integrated manufacturing facilities that span the rivers of Pittsburgh or the shores of Lake Michigan. I think that we will see a shift to customization where mini-mills with Electric Arc furnaces will scatter near centroids of consumption. Production will be in smaller lot sizes and balanced to meet market demand. Production will be with highly efficient manufacturing operations that will once again create the economic barriers to entry that propelled American steel for decades after WWII.

A previous statement from Robert LaCaze, EVP of Bayer's new Oncology Strategic Business Unit (“Bayer is to move 2 IO agents into first in human trials - will announce which at a medical meeting this year) increases the likelihood that the company will announce at this meeting that they are advancing BAY1905254/CGEN-15001T to clinical trials.

"I would like for someone to accurately explain where the shorts are going to find +/- 30 million shares???I have seen a few explanations but NONE of them really make Market sense!Unless one or more of the ""big boys"" decides to sell or chippy decides on another Secondary, I just do NOT think that many shares are ""available.""But, then again, the shorts have not been covering!  WHY???Of course, IMO.",
Well Geron's is hosting an analyst Conference on March 19th 8:30 AM EST to discuss earnings and recent events.,
"Geron's large short position is rational but not necessarily based on better information.  Geron certainly conforms to the profile biotech shorts find attractive (one product in clinical trials which has already been placed on hold by the FDA etc. etc.). In fact, the current size of the short position is largely attributable to the FDA's Hold (millions of shares were shorted at below 2 when the FDA placed Imetelstat on Hold).We Geron shareholders who have held for many years are not happy about the pps but understand why it is where it is.  We've held because we believe the drug will ultimately be approved and that it will be very successful.   I'm sure most of us think the time frame to confirmation is in months, perhaps weeks, maybe even days, not years.  Shorts have yet to come to that conclusion and probably won't until it  is irrefutable.Unfortunately for Geron's shorts,  if there is irrefutable evidence of Imetelstat's future success, it will probably come after a steady climb in the pps similar to the recent pattern, i.e. a steady rise without news.  AE is clearly a clever short and has followed the stock closely enough to read the Tea Leaves.  His two shamefully manipulative articles may have served his purpose and provided him an opportunity to exit more gracefully than his short brethren. None of us know how this will eventually play out - especially if the past is prologue. OTH, even if the only info shared via the Trial Review, due by the end of this quarter, is that  medium survival  has not been reached and that those patients participating in the trial will continue to receive Imetelstat, the probability of success will become extremely difficult to refute.  If the news is favorable - shorts will start covering, institutions will increase their holdings and the pps will respond accordingly.  The rise may come in fits and starts or it may be sudden and sustained, regardless I'm sure it will eventuate in a pps that will reward our patience. The odds I believe have subtly turned significantly in our favor.",
"Sangamo going from $3 to $27 in a year is what We all should hope for Geron also. I used to have bunch of Sangamo stocks. I sold it out of frustration. Subsequently They kicked out their founder CEO and now they are doing fine.The reason Geron shareholders are so bothered by a clown sitting in his pajama in his Mom basement writing these hit pieces is because that they have not had a sniff of winning for so long. Company always has an excuse for failing, but excuses after a long while become old. Lets hope that We see some of the Sangamo type of reversal here soon. Of course I am very long but always worried about yet another excuse and another bad news. That is what you become accustomed to as Geron shareholder. Lets hope We see a change soon.",

"All indications and data lately point to efficacy, safety, and an unmet need. That is, of course, why imetelstat has been given Fast Track Status by the FDA. In my opinion, given the latest data, approval seems very likely. When I buy a stock, in this sector, I am looking for undervaluation against its future likely value and potential. Geron has it all going for it currently.IMO Those short or negative are not only wrong, IMO, but looking back in the rear view mirror. If that were not enough, there is a big short position: 30 Million plus shares as of the latest release. Simply a fact. If the longs currently have this right, imagine trying to cover all those shares on good news. I do not buy stocks because of short positions, but I do not ignore the reality of them either. If I like this stock, the short position is just an additional great fact, and will need to be covered at some point. Try buying 30 million shares here, even now, and see what happens!! We shall see how it works out, but I would not part with a single share and will hold till the story unfolds fully, regardless of any volatility. But I do think this is going up multiples of its current price over the next couple of years, or maybe sooner! EOS IMO",
I'm not sure why people reply to this article. It's just a piece of junk. Don't waste your time here.,
"AE,Fake news",
ha ha ha! Nice try! 1 patient. our short position has made you desperate!!!!!!,
There's an ancient proverb....he who aggrandizes places the cart before the horse.,
"so risks in Geron is high, and reward is very very modest.  Shareholders who have bought in over $4 can basically kiss their risk versus reward bet good bye.  Reward will be modest given the risks taken here, that in itself is high risk! i.e. very modest rewards.",
"well, Geron exeeds expectations on the downside, but lags badly on the upside.",
And now he's crying on twitter trying to influence the twits ? All for his personal gain. What a stellar human POS.,
He's going for more media exposure and thus his alias because he failed miserably the second hit piece and has been thoroughly exposed.,
"AE is on Twitter bashing GERN longs as ""Geridiots"".  I'm guessing that's a clever way of combining Geron & idiot, but for an author associated with Seeking Alpha I'm surprised about such disparaging remarks being so made openly.  It clearly indicates that the author has an axe to grind.  My guess is that he needs to raise money to continue to pay his defense attorneys.""Alpha Exposure@alpha_exposure 20h20 hours agoMore$GERN - can we all agree that the holders here are Geridiots?""",

"oh great Jacosa is here.   everyone fails to mention that for those whom Imetelstat works well for, the dosage interval and dose are frequently lengthened unlike Jakafi that always gets increased until side affects are too severe, then backed off, all while signs of the disease return.",
You just may get your wish if JNJ or Geron takes IMET frontline MF against jakafi as a control. Then we will see the truth and nothing but the truth. I would expect IMET to work faster and with real curing results and be able to back down dosages for improved safety and longer infusion times. Then you'll see likely a better safety profile than jakafi but with CRs/PRs and many CIs.,
"Ok, invoking Hy's Law is going a bit far.  Evidence of recovery after the drug is discontinued pretty much cancels the alarm (well, partly depending on speed of recovery...I was once almost a Hy's law case, but recovered in a week...the drug is still used).But imetelstat IS still a very toxic drug.  We've been told repeatedly that the Janssen results fit the safety/tolerability profile of the NEJM puplications...that is pretty poor.  It has also never been compared in public against either simultaneous controls or MATCHED historical controls.",
"well telomerase, today CDXC did fall harder than geron....down 6%",

So true Jorge..... If one drinks too much water the odds of becoming sodium deficient is very high.It can be dangerous.,
"wow, was i so wrong to get back into Geron so early!  This has nothing to do with longs, shorts, but more to do with no results from Geron!1. buying too early in the day means you're buying from shorts2. Geron achieved $1.75 or so not to long ago, this is where we're headed as the market corrects3. Geron has showed it holds no water, so $1.75 is where it stabilizes at4. Management has produced nothing of concrete value but delays, so the market is pricing that in.5.  No amount of optimism can check a market slide, which simply did a short covering bounce last week, and continuing the correction, and Geron along with it.6. Geron needs to pull a magic rabbit out of the hat, but there is none as management goes by the book and typically announces delays rather than any 'surprise'.",
"hmm, look at all that ""buying"" or short covering.  After all is said and done, Geron price goes back down again to trade at a lower level.  Shares just changing hands  lower and lower like a balloon deflating.Something needs to come from geron, otherwise, we'll be re-valued lower.",
"Alpha Exposure just doesn't understand. Fidelity is selling, JNJ won't buy GERN, GERN's CEO won't buy GERN. And of course the short interest is very high.

"A more specific signal of such potential is a higher rate of more marked peak AT elevations (10x-, 15xULN), with cases of increases to >1,000 U/L causing increased concern. The single clearest (most specific) predictor found to date of a drug’s potential for severe hepatotoxicity, however, is the occurrence of a small number of cases of hepatocellular injury (aminotransferase elevation) accompanied by increased serum total bilirubin (TBL), not explained by any other cause, such as viral hepatitis or exposure to other hepatotoxins, and without evidence of cholestasis, together with an increased incidence of AT elevations in the overall trial population compared to control. Increased plasma prothrombin time, or its international normalized ratio (INR), a consequence of reduced hepatic production of Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, is another potentially useful measure of liver function that might suggest the potential for severe liver injury.",

"I am a former student of Dr. Hy Zimmerman and yes that was a long time ago, Hy was a fine fine gentleman and a brilliant man.  I think it is clear that the FDA has addressed the HY's law concerns years ago and sternly so with the temporary clinical hold.  It is also apparent and true that preeminent physicians such as Dr. Tefferi and Dr. Raza have experience with use of the drug as well as physicians at all of the institutions involved in both the MF and the MDS studies.  These total over 100 well regarded institutions around the world with the blessing and supervision of the FDA and Janssen.  I am laughing that anyone is taking this poorly informed drivel as worth discussing and will have nothing more to say about it.  bp",
"a good question is if this was true, why not short as much stock as possible and wait for the FAA hold to come out which would tank the stock and you would make big bucks.  why post an article on SA warning everyone?  because it ain't going to happen and is a hit piece.",

And other than GERN what are your favorite short ideas.,
"Don't usually comment on articles but the first line of the article is from the "" have you stopped cheating on your wife "" line of logic.

"After requesting information from GERN, FDA didn’t follow up with any action for a few months already, so that means information received has satisfied FDA concerns.

"I like the tale of the tape the last couple of weeks. Somebody thinks the first Q beat analyst projections. IEC has had some bad years working through some of the previous CEOs follies (SCB). I have a lot of faith in Jeff's management. He seemed to be the key to their run of 2005 to 2012 ($19mil to $140 mil.). I would like more information consistently.We were told of 3rd Q orders of $52 million as an after thought. That information on a Quarterly basis could give an indication of future revenue.They confirmed 1.3 sales to revenue. Can they confirm that figure quarterly? If so, indicates a huge organic growth rate.I'm not in a hurry for the company to be sold. If the growth continues at 25-30% I would expect both the earnings and the PE to grow significantly. I do not see a reason to give that growth to another company at a discount.",

Business plan is starting to work.  Book/Bill +  Backlog growth + Margins+ Low production on boarding turning into regular production+.

"Jeff does have 416k options that strike at $4.10, so he may not have downside skin in the game but he has a lot of upside if he can make this dog hunt.

"Do you buy from the illegal market ? I do daily . It sucks my dealer is never on time , and can’t wait for legalization . The black market will disappear pretty quick . I rather buy from a respected company than some drug dealer who has know idea what’s in the Herb ...",
"One last thought: as I asked above, what about the black market? Seems very few prognosticators are talking about this. It's not going to magically disappear over night, particularly since heavy users have years-long relationships with their dealers, and if said dealers can offer a better deal than the local government or private vendor, why shop elsewhere? It's not like the dealers aren't offering a quality product already, and even if they have to drop their prices to $3 or $4 Canadian per gram, that's a much, much better deal than consumers will be offered legally, and for the illegal growers and dealers, still works out to $3,000 to $4,000 per kg to split between them, or for the vertically integrated grower/dealers, keep all income for themselves.This is the main reason I side with the lower estimates. But of course, only time will tell.",
Took a position today. Felt this a good entry point.,
"That’s a fair point but let’s also remember too that the demand is projected as high as 900,000kg for dried cannabis. A lot of these plants will also be used for cannabis oil. Plus there’s usually a bit of a cushion if you look at their 10-k’s between the amount grown and the amount shipped. Some of the plants don’t meet standards for whatever reason. I agree not much will likely diminish that supply number, but it will be slightly diminished.",
"Great article, but I disagree on one major point, and that is your supply forecast. With all the majors - Aurora, Aphria, Canopy, Wheaton, and even Hydropothecary, expanding rapidly, I think we'll see a state of oversupply by early next year. Aurora says they'll be growing 270,000 kg by early 2019, Aphria 230,000 kg, Wheaton 200,000 kg plus, Hydropothecary 100,000 kg, and - while I don't have a figure for Canopy - based on their construction boom underway, guesstimating over 250,000 kg.  So when looking at the math, those five alone will have somewhere in the neighborhood of a minimum of 1,000,000 kg of flower production. Add in other bigs like Emerald, Organigram, MedReleaf, and Cronos, plus the other 80 plus licensed producers, and that means massive overproduction by early next year.And let's not forget that the massive black market that's flourishing in Canada at this time is not going away over night. And there won't be enough sales in Europe and Australia - particularly since those areas are building facilities of their own (some in cooperation with the Canadian bigs) - to absorb the excess, nor will illegal smuggling to US border states make much of a difference since product from Oregon, California and Colorado already satisfies the demand in those states.I view this as a plus for Hydropothecary and Aphria, both low cost producers, since this will give them an advantage in the inevitable price wars to come, which will of course have a big impact on margins. That's why I'm long Hydropothecary and Aprhia. I also like MedReleaf and to a slightly lesser extent Organigram because of their award-winning products (see 2017 Canadian Cannabis Award winners), and the fact that they're not as insanely overvalued as Canopy and particularly Aurora are at this time.I advise all investors who didn't get into this sector before the current ""reefer madness rally"" - as one yahoo commenter so eloquently described it - that has peaked and is now subsiding to wait until prices drop to sane levels to get in. And for those who did get in before fall of last year, sell off and take a profit, and wait a few months to get back in at better price points for all the Canadian cannabis producers.",
It barely bounced after the SAQ deal was announced yet gave back more. Can't put my finger on it but this stock is a dog relative to it's peers.,
"Good points made. I differ on their ability to grow, I am under the understanding that with current facilities that they are way under their grow capacity. They also have employee difficulties. I had fiqured that they would get a good SAQ deal as management/directors have good gov/t infiltration. Can they get a good deal with a good public drug co. in Quebec as the Globe and Mail surmises. I believe that Cronos does not have their 1.9% stake in THCX anymore and am wondering why. Would love feedback. Have a great year. Herb",

Right back where we started,
I went long today on ABX. I listened to the February investor presentation  and became convinced I was much too pessimistic concerning the coming years. Actually the stock looks quite undervalued at $12.7,

Falling wedge is now a knife.   Seen this before. ABX was cheap at 16+ then 13+. news. now its cheap at 11+.   There will be others saying its cheap 10+. That is the life of a knife catcher.

One thing is certain dont be a knife catcher,
"I think Fed talk is spooking the entire market with gold miners taking it the hardest. BUT, Powell said today he sees no wage pressure now - he just blinked. This is big for gold prices and stocks like ABX which are so leveraged to the gold price. Longer term the $ faces huge challenges that I do not think can be overcome. Bottom line this ABX selloff looks like one of the most risk free deals out there. Every other non commodity sector faces extreme risk, now that tarrifs are on. Back to the 1930's here we go.",
sure fire way to underperform is to buy 52 week low stocks...i dont see support until low 10sgood luck ABX longs,

Quite a drubbing today. Straight up -3%. Im lovin this new fed chairman already.... not!,

"Well, now that ABX has broken down through channel support, it's likely going to retest 2016 lows near $8. I'll wait for this sale because it seems some smart money wants out until some fundamental issues are ironed out (e.g., debt, reserves, non-producing assets).",
"For ABX, I expect the recent move has nothing to do with the spot price of gold, and EVERYTHING to do with their statement that the have reduced their reserves by 25%! That is huge, and until they can publicly address that, ABX is vulnerable...",

"It is stunning to see the ABX collapsing when the dollar is falling hard as well. And, inflation is rising as well. Puzzling to me... Looks as if gold is losing its store of value, and it is not crypto currency...",

"Thanks for reminding me of the bright side re. ABX, Funtrading.I am still long ABX after reducing post Q3 disappointment. But my mood sours - and I am going to rant a bit for the rest of this post.ABX has been an erratic company over many years as we all know.Now they go down that path again:1. They disappoint on cost - never quite reached the $700 area for AISC that they talked about in  Q217, if I recall correctly. Costs are rising again - maybe unavoidable as some inputs like energy prices spike. But will the $800 range hold?2. The production outlook - while probably rational / return focused - is terrible headline news.3. Dealing with thugs in Tanzania: Instead hanging out  Acacia to dry (and maybe force their assets into care and maintenance and fire all & sundry personal in Tanzania) & pursue the thugs in Tanzania by all legal means so as to make any international financial activity costly, risky, impossible and wreck their reputation (to do that you only have to selectively broadcast their ridiculous statements) they hand them $ 300M on a plate. Lesson to the thugs: If you demand $ 100 Billion for no reason at all, you get $ 300 m - so why not demand $ 1 Tr. next year?4. Re. Pascua Lama the Chilean court handed them an excellent reason to do nothing costly but hold the asset as an option. Just wait - for instance for Gold at $2000. If the Chinese partners get antsy before -- fine: let them shoulder  most of the risk - and pre - finance most of the outlay..(but most likely they won't).After $ 5+ B. or so sunk and nothing to show for it I do not really want to hear about a (inherently even more costly) underground mine design on the Argentinian side...The gold there has been degraded to resources - that was the reason for most of the 20m reserve downgrade last year. It is not clear if bringing that back to reserves is the easiest way - usually brownfield is a lot cheaper than greenfield projects - especially failed ones with $ 5+B. in the hole. Reconsider PascuaLama only when the economics look a lot better for instance when Gold hits $ 1900 - 2k / toz.5. Copper has probably upside - but is ABX really the best owner for 2 cost - challenged subscale mines in Congo - a 'jurisdiction' arguably even worse than Tanzania or Haiti ? (no I am not going to repeat the labeling by Mr. Trump - but lets just say they use force to extract whatever they want - especially after others have incurred substantial sunk cost.. ). Read about the tribulations Glencore is in - but they want the Wolfram which you do not get anywhere else. But for copper? Sooner or later you run afoul with the foreign corrupt practices act - and the you are in really hot water.If you have copper as a by product in your goldmine - fine. But looking for trouble in the heart of darkness (That's the name Joseph Conrad aptly picked for the place)? So if you address these points - inroads for chaos, where do you get?- you are in relatively clean jurisdictions - rare for a miner - any miner except maybe BHP. Let your investors know....- You are not the biggest, but a very productive, high margin gold miner with proven long life assets mostly in easy locations - not out in the sticks- as a low cost producer you cannot be the swing producer that bags outrageous windfalls from say $ 2000 - gold - so do not even try to argue it. But at AISC around $ 800 you have very good margins from safe productive assets. You could position yourself as sort of a gold price+ proxy - not an. erratic metal outfit that always manages to destroy tailwind from commodity prices by building dysfunctional holes (PascuaLama) or hedge books (the old ABX has destroyed so much value doing that).- if you have spare $ to invest - fine. Use your expertise to pick shares in junior miners (other than Acacia) in acceptable jurisdictions and let them do the greenfield stuff. - Become a cash rich miner (OK, it is hard to imagine a dog hoarding sausage..)and then use your field expertise to pick promising assets when they are priced for a trainwreck. (Look at Suncor for inspiration...they have a nice slide re. buy low - sell high in their quarterly presentation)This last 2 points would likely do a lot more for your upside phantasy in the next gold boom than sinking more $ in what must now be seen as a bottomless pit. A few years down the line that option may look very promising especially at a much higher gold price. And the interim defeat will be far away  in the rear view mirror..OK. This will most likely not happen. Gold miners are, alas, almost as reckless as governments and their  match as masters of the serial miss. A t some point I will probably redeploy capital towards less adventurous outfits (but likely only at a much higher gold price...or is the the story rather oil, now that everyone is talking about peak oil (demand) and few trust the price trend...)regardsNicklaas",

"Although it is a cash machine today, ABX will be confronted with gigantic investments in the coming years to replace its rapidly ageing mines especially Goldstrike, Veladero and Lagunas Norte.  Still 5 bn to deleverage, so free cashflow could become minimal or nonexistent in coming years. Probably AEM is a much better choice right now.",

"Good article, but I believe management has stated that the declining cost-per-click is driven primarily by the high growth of mobile paid clicks which have a lower cost-per-click than desktop.  YouTube mix may have some effect on this, but mobile is the primary driver.  As mix stabilizes (who knows when that will happen) I would expect that paid click growth would decelerate, but so would the decline in cost-per-click.  I wouldn’t bank on Google maintaining a 40%+ growth rate in paid clicks while cost-per-click declines moderate. Since mix shift is the driver, these metrics will likely continue their negative correlation as an off-setting force (i.e. acceleration in paid clicks leading to accelerated declines in cost-per-click and vice versa).",

This JV is baking to another huge surprise.",
"The author has not accounted for the $42 million+ annual amortization requirement which would bring down FCF to zero according to his calculations.But the reality might be even worse:On the recent call, management outlined an increase in marketing spending and the reset of the company's bonus program which in combination could result in a $30 million hit to FCF. Moreover, the CFO stated the inventory reduction benefit in 2017 as being ""more than $70"" million and 2017 FCF was $196.7 million.After debt amortization, 2018 FCF could very well end up being negative. That said, the bigger issue remains the urgent need to engineer a turnaround in the company's core North American operations until the end of 2019 as GNC will have to address their debt again at that time (as otherwise it will become current on the balance sheet in early 2020). Last week's transaction will help them to avoid bankruptcy for now but without a turnaround in the core business, the issue will come up again at the end of next year.",

"Sandstorm Gold to Unveil “Launch Lab”Streaming group to launch an internal equity sales desk, says CEO Nolan Watson, turning Sandstorm into a one-stop shop for smaller companiesVancouver-based streaming group Sandstorm Gold is launching its own in-house equity sales desk to help push the small companies it works with, founder Nolan Watson told Global Mining Observer in an interview.   Internally dubbed the “launch lab”, Sandstorm, which has built a C$1.1bn ($852m) market cap by buying gold royalties and streams, plans to start supporting its partner companies by pooling its internal resources, from its IR department through to its database of investors, turning the group into a one stop shop for smaller mining companies looking to raise capital.   Sandstorm has hired three staff in advertising, design and for brokerage calls and will launch the lab alongside its next streaming deal “over the next few months”, Watson said.   The new sales desk will be “stepping into a gap” created by the rapid rise of passive investing, which has sucked capital out of specialist mining funds, making it harder for mining bosses to pull money into promising new mining stories, Watson says. “I really do see a massive shift. Even with market caps of half a billion, companies cannot attract the capital that they once could.”   “One of the things Sandstorm is trying to do is say, hey, if you do a financing withSandstorm and you sell us a royalty and we really like your story, your stock, your management team, we will act as the catalyst to draw attention to your story.”   Nearly $7 trillion globally is now managed by passive funds, which track indices and have low fees, up from under $3 trillion five years ago, according to data group Morningstar. At current rates, more than half of all money is tipped to turn passive in the next five years, replacing hundreds of fund managers with algorithms.   Sandstorm says its own investor base has changed dramatically in recent years, with passive funds gobbling-up a third of its stock since 2014. Watson, who founded the company in 2009, believes its other shareholders, including over 40,000 private investors, can help boost its partner-companies in the sub-$300m bracket.   “We don't want to saddle Sandstorm's shareholders with a bunch of G&A, so the idea is, if we have more and more demand for those services we'll just continue to hire people.”   Sandstorm reported record revenue of $68m in February, up from $52m two years ago, collecting 55,000 ounces of gold, its eighth consecutive annual record. “Hopefully we can keep that going,” Watson said.",
"I am still with Sand but my losses are huge. Precious metals are down and it seems that the situation will continue for who knows how long. It's definitely not a good time to hold on PMs. I could have other stocks that went up instead of this one, no matter how good Sand's management is.",

Does anyone know the latest book value per share for SAND ? I can't seem to find it on the annual report.,
Too much dilution and too many promises. Every quarter they have some excuse. I would like to own this stock but management credibility is a problem.,
"Great article, thank you. Like the adjusted net income discussion. That being said, are there risks to ignoring the impairments and other negative affects on income that you adjusted out. Put another way, do you expect the reasons for those to change in the future for Sandstorm and if so, why? For example, will the weakening dollar hurt or help the affects of foreign exchange on the balance sheet moving forward?",
"Great article. In your article you discuss the importance of book value. From a historical perspective, what is a good P/B for a streaming company?  Investors who got into SAND in 2014 at $10 a share have seen colossal losses.",
Good article. Clear and informative.  You adjusted accounting statements to reflect underlying economic reality.I am still amazed by how much SAND moves in price up and down relative to the change in its underling cash flows.,
Sand should focus on steaming.They should sell there Mariana shares and keep a stream on that project.Running a mine is not there core business! And I do expect a lot of problems in Turkey. When the Mariana project starts making a good profit the Turkish government will kick SAND out somehow. It’s not a stable country to invest in at this moment.,
Good time to add shares,
thank you...still long SAND shares for years now with only a 40% gain. A simple SPX ETF would have been better until now but a wait patiently for the gold price to break out,
Great read. Thx. 👍,

"The lessors seem poised for a good year, but my bigger concern is what seems to be happening with the shipping *lines* themselves, or rather, whether/how WS differentiates between shippers and lessors in its trade strategies.  Most of the articles I am reading indicate that shippers' spot rates are dropping as a result of new TEU shipping capacity coming online in '18 that may outstrip demand growth.  In some cases late '17 rates are below late '16 rates, and there is already expected to be some weakness coming out of the CNY - a couple hundred dollars drop on some routes.  In spite of all the shipping line mergers and alliances that occurred in the wake of Hanjin, the past couple days, Korean HMM has started making lots of noise about growing itself with a large number of the biggest ships.  In general there seems to have been a big uptick in the newbuild orderbook and lots of the biggest ships will be coming online later this year, so that pressure isn't going away.  But it's happening just as the *shipping* industry appeared to be climbing out of a big hole.  Now, none of this is container lessors themselves, but it is their customer base, and so if their customer base's profitability is threatened, perhaps theirs is too.  That said, part of the collapse in '15 was cratering steel prices which made it hard to price contracts to lock in profitable lease rates or sell used containers profitably, and as far a I know, steel prices are very healthy at the moment.  Though the impact of steel tariffs on pricing is unknown - will it result in higher or lower prices through either a tariff or trade war?  Hard to say.  I think there is a lot of uncertainty for those reasons, in spite of an otherwise excellent global growth environment, which makes it very difficult to predict where it goes from here.  I'd like to think WS can distinguish between lessors and shippers, as the two are wholly different businesses, but this information seems to have been trickling out over the past couple months (though only recently became easy to find) which are incidentally the same months that lessors have been getting relentlessly hammered.  I initially thought it was just a high beta reaction to the general market correction.  Hopefully it isn't setting up for a repeat of '15-'16",

"It's good to hear BIDU is back to operating at a healthy pace. I've held through some volatile years. Foolishly, I sold BABA when it was in the 80s and swapped it for MA as I had too much foreign exposure. It turned out to not be a horrible decision at the time (or even today).",

BIDU sold off BIDU eatery, other O2O businesses at a very cheap price and also Ridesharing part got sold with Uber was also very small (BIDU got 1 or 2 B dollars and 1 or 2 percent of the total ride sharing business share). CTRP sell out was comparatively okay.So there might be a justification for sell sides to value these assets to 0.

For now, I do feel, the power of Mr. Dell is a compelling one, esp. since, as a de facto private company, he will do whatever it takes to get the job done, which is simply to bring the fully merged Dell-EMC powerhouse, with a thoroughly ""ingested"" VMW as a worthy, if not only worthy successor to IBM.I feel Mr. Dell knows how to plug and play with the likes of ORCL, SAP, MSFT, WDAY, CRM, and countless others, and one cannot underestimate his ""rolodex power"", as Dell's PCs and servers are now in the front, back offices, halls, hospitals, clinics, govt depts, labs and data centres of thousands of customers worldwide, across many industries, and running many applications. I ""feel"", with Cloud and Hybrid Cloud memory and storage playing a larger than life part in computing, the Dell ""eco-system"" is a force to be reckoned with, and my ""attraction"" to them is the sheer magnetism and selling power of Mr. Pat Gelsinger at VMW. He does know his stuff, he struts it excellently, and I think the eco-system could do worse when it does go public again, with Mr. Gelsinger as the CEO, and Mr. Dell, like Mr. Ellison at Oracle, as the Executive Chairman.In short, I feel DVMT is a better bargain than NTAP, but would be grateful for your thoughts?",
"The author is correct in many respects. The market overreacted to what were not only encouraging top- and bottom-line numbers by NetApp, but also strong guidance. The revenue results, particularly product revenue, shows that the company's relative strength in the mid-range market was under-estimated, while its position in hyper-converged infrastructure and hybrid clouds is taking share.What's more, the market is overlooking what is -- arguably -- NetApp's biggest asset: Its $3.45B net cash at quarter's end, while cash from operations nearly double from a year ago to $420M vs. a year-ago $235M.That much firepower gives management the opportunity to pursue M&A to reinvigorate its positioning relative to where storage seems to be heading. In other words, the company is either delivering and will have the ability to deliver on the growth metrics that the Street generally requires as a prerequisite for bullishness. As such, NetApp -- which I forecast will reach $70 by year's end -- has significantly more value than the market credits today.",NetApp: Shares For Sale

Oh Bill, every time I read your negative articles I have to ask,,, how do you live with such pessimism in your life??",
"Tesla articles and comments are hilarious to read. Let's talk about serious issues.1. The future of electric cars may be very adversely affected by shortages of raw materials. Does anyone dispute that?2. Much of Tesla's sales are due to tax incentives. If electric cars become  a mass market do we believe governments can subsidize everyone? 3. The EU has mandated a standard for charging station equipment that is not compatible with Teslas. Every other manufacturer will get a free charging network. 4. Teslas take much longer to charge to 75% capacity. The result is they have to charge more often on trips. 5. China is going to electric cars and controls some of the strategic materials. Will they favor Tesla as a supplier or folks manufacturing in China? It is the world's largest market.  So in Europe at least you have to believe that Tesla can overcome all of the above to succeed as European car makers start to spew out new electric models. The conclusion is that Tesla is a very speculative investment, not for the faint of heart. If a bull tells you with certainty that Tesla will succeed they are lacking analytical skills to say the least. The bears have a stronger case but that is also not certain.",

"I don’t get the hype about Tesla. Is the brand really heavily favoured compared to other auto companies? There’s nothing special about Tesla cars that other auto makers can’t match.

Tesla ""gross margin"" is retail sales price / wholesale cost which is useless and misleading since it leaves people with the impression that Tesla is profitable in any way.

In the (very) likely event of a market rout and freezing of access to new money, the share price will be in single digits before TSLA seeks Chapter 11 protection. Owners of puts will do ludicrously well if/when TSLA joins the list of companies which lost 99% of their share price.",

"Bill, I think the focus should remain on the demand/orders (Norway dropping is probably linked to the change in tax rebate, so will it persist months ahead?), the likely avalanche of cancellations (as hinted in an earlier article), and the resulting cash and rating issues. Especially any sign of the cancellations could flip this case quickly as that means cash drain and more questions on the balance sheet.The cobolt and libor seem to me to be red herrings; 22kg cobolt per car x $27/lb increased cost x 0.45 lb/kg = $270/car only cp. total cost of goods sold.55 bps increased rate on $1.2B (or is more of debt affected perhaps) = $7m/year increased interest.

"I appreciate the author putting out these analyst updates periodically.  Every time they show the exact same ting.  The analysts begin by predicting that the new period in question will be that breakthrough where we see profits.

And even then they STILL have to keep downgrading.  And at the end, of course, they crow to clients about how they ""nailed it.""What a clown show this is.And keep in mind that the only reason this stuff isn't losing $100/share is because of all the dilution that happened when Elon awarded himself and his buddies millions of shares, and then proceeded to create millions more in bailing out Solar City.By the same taken, this same dilution means that even if the company were to suddenly execute brilliantly, the ceiling could well be something like $5/share under the best of circumstances.

The losses are out of control for a company with no IP. Business model is clearly not working. The more samples they run the more money they lose. Myriad makes $200M on volume they make $20M,
"On the subject of tests reported, the last 5 quarters (Q4/16 - Q4/17) are as  follows:20,500 - 25,980 - 30,400 - 34,400 - 45,500.  These figures represent NVTA base business only, and do not include either CBMX or GoodStart business.  CBMX and Good Start represent about 8000 tests per quarter, and Q1 will be NVTA's first quarter in which both these new companies contribute fully.  Nowadays, of course, each test is worth about $479.So here's the question:Given that NVTA's base business grew about 32% (34,400 to 45,500) from Q3 to Q4, and 31% from Q2 to Q3, why is it assumed by everyone that growth will suddenly level off to a level of around 60,000 tests per quarter, and then grow at a somewhat sedate rate?Is it possible that your projected 2018 revenue of $118,956,000 is wildly off, or is your number based upon something which has escaped me?",
One of the highest quality pieces I have seen on SA. Nice work...,
"To begin, I agree with the very beginning of your article. There is a race to the bottom for genetic sequencing, with the clear winner in the end being Illumina. Sort of like lawyers in a trial.I don’t have any special knowledge about many industries, but interpretation of genetic results is one of them. I do it for a living. I’m a physician-scientist who sequences children with rheumatologic conditions and (try to!) interpret genetic results on a daily basis. Let me start by being blunt: Invitae has absolutely no moat. If you disagree, please list their patents or patent applications or any IP they may have. Now, let me provide some further discussion. Genetics is great because it eliminates interpretation. It’s either you have a disease causing variant or you don’t. That said, the biggest question in genetics (in all of medicine, really) is whether a given mutation leads to a specific phenotype. This doesn’t take interpretation, but years of research into the functional consequences of a defective protein. Currently, the NIH’s budget is about $35 billion yearly. Then you add in private grants, then you add in global funding, then you add in industry money. There are hundreds of billions of dollars being poured into the study of functional variants. A single company just can’t compete with the public and private money being spent. And let’s not pretend Invitae is doing any of their own research. So, is it in “presentation”? What does Invitae tell us? As fate would have it, a patient I saw last week came in with a report for their 207 gene Primary Immunodeficiency Panel. I trust the author has reviewed one of their reports for himself. There was nothing on there that could possibly be confused with proprietary knowledge or IP.  Or, nothing that a company being founded tomorrow wouldn’t be able to do. It listed the variants found and under each, listed a few references that could be found on PubMed. In this case, for each of the 4 variants found, the conclusion was “variant of unknown clinical significance”. Back to the lab I guess. Keep in mind, this is a pretty standard genetic report, very similar to what I’ve seen from GeneDx (who, btw, have been sequencing since 2000 and I’ll let you guys investigate what their market value is). A couple more thoughts. Anyone can order sequencing from Invitae. So there is DTC business. My last thought is that proprietary targeted gene panels will be out of vogue very shortly (if not already). No one bothers with them anymore. We go right to whole exome. And as data storage and costs will allow us, we’ll be going right to whole genome within the next 5 years.",

The shorts are going to get scorched in April when the actual production figure are released.They are choosing the believe the Bloomberg analysis which is deeply flawed. Bloomberg needs to hire someone with some analytic ability instead of trolls. Bloomberg has production in the first week of January as less than 500 units. This is is about half what it  was in the last week in December.Bloomberg is flawed because it fails to consider the delay in reporting to the NHTSA after a car is produced. There is no reason to report before the sale is complete.,
"For Background: I don't own nor have I sold short any shares of TSLA, now or will I ever on both counts. I hold Accounting and Finance degrees and have 30+ years market experience.IMO: The demand for TSLA shares you cite is a byproduct of the huge increase in passive investing i.e.....if managers/people buy the index, they have to buy the whole index, including TSLA. Unfortunately, in the case of index and TSLA buyers, I'm afraid your buying the sizzle, not getting the steak.-The revenue growth you speak of could be accomplished by any 3rd grader. If I find a kid willing to give me $2 for every $1 I have, his business will grow to infinity, right up to when he runs out of money. When revenue growth = increasing losses it is NOT an attribute. - Regarding your willingness to continue to accept lies from management and pass them off as aggressive projections your hypothesis of Elon eventually getting it right, sounds a lot like the shorts belief that he will fail. Basing your investment on a high profile, CEO entering a very crowded  market, with no manufacturing experience, new technology and proficiency to spend money is way too risky for my money. As is betting against arguably the best visionary of our time, with a cult like following and a real talent for marketing.It's not hard to find better risk rewards.....FWIW",

"I was wondering why a dividend investor would focus on Tesla as an investment.  After all there is no dividend or even a buy back, just yearly dilution that does not look like it will improve anytime soon.  Then I saw this paragraph while you were talking about people who have been writing bearish articles about TSLA:""I would allege that these unremitting posts are a clear indication that the authors are hedging themselves against their bearish thesis by writing posts as a source of revenue against their short positions (a savvy move, I must say).""So how does that compare with a writer who focuses on income producing stocks and writes an article on 10/13/17 titled ""Why dividend growth investors should consider GE"".  After the 50% dividend haircut that GE announces only 1 month later and the subsequent 35% fall in the stock price, I think I now understand why you would write this article.  Admittedly, TSLA articles get eyeballs which generate money to the author.  Did you perhaps invest in GE and now need to make back some cash as well?  One has to wonder why an ""Income Machine"" would look at a stock that has no hope of declaring a dividend within the next few years and has yet to produce ANY net income in the 14.5 years since it was founded and the 7.5 years since it IPO'd.  But writing articles like this could be ""a savvy move"" to supplement the possible income lost investing in a GE.If you had actually read any bearish articles, you would see that most of them focus on such fundamentals as growing debt, rising losses, Tesla's production woes, lack of focus, cash burn.  Sure revenue has increased impressively.  Why has all this revenue not lead to any kind of net income or at least, a reduction in losses?  Instead the more revenue they generate, the higher the losses they produce as it costs them more to generate revenue than what they actually receive. You look at one side of the coin and completely disregard the other side.  I read most bear articles as a warning sign.  They are trying to tell people the ride will end soon.  Now ""soon"" is an amorphous term.  For one person, soon is next week.  For another it's within the next few years.  But the warning signs are there just like they were there in 2005 when a few prescient people were warning about the danger of the ""housing ATM"" while most of the country was celebrating how many houses they could buy and flip and sell, etc.  It took a few year but the doomsayers were right.  They saw the signs and tried to warn people about it.  The media was talking about how great the markets were, how people were getting rich in real estate, how the banks and mortgage companies were growing like mad all the while ignoring all of the risky crap being stuffed under the rug that was fueling this growth.   While you tout the $3 billion Telsa holds, I am reminded of all of the billions held by Lehman Bros and Bear Stearns.  Not nearly enough to pay the bills as it turned out when demands were actually made on those companies.  How long can Tesla hold onto their cash and not pay their bills (they admitted to stretching out payments to vendors - which seems to be announced every quarter) all while not being able to effectively produce their make or break vehicle?",

"Let me start this comment by saying I don't hate Musk or Tesla. I like their vehicles. They are aesthetically pleasing and fun to drive. In fact, I even owned Tesla stock years ago but sold my shares bc it got too expensive for my tastes and it seemed to be trading on hopes and dreams rather then a realistic future valuation. Ive shorted Tesla twice in 2017-2018 via put spreads purely based on the insane valuation. Both were successful trades but not as succesful as I would have liked giving the bad news that would sink any other company. In the end Tesla is an auto company & autos are an extremely capital intensive business hence why most automobile companies trade at a low PE. And to those saying Tesla is making the world a better place and is really a tech/solar/self driving business just please. Look at its competitors and you have Honda, a great company, trading below book value w/ a FPE of 9 & a nice dividend and still working on hydrogen, a far superior clean technology in my opinion. Maybe you want to invest in solar then go with First Solar, a great manufacturer that is well positioned for the future. In regards to self driving pick ANYONE else other then Tesla bc they all have left Tesla in the dust in regards to self driving. Musk is a marketing genius who keeps spinning the narrative but with each new pie in the sky announcement I and others (except for the fanatics) trust him less and less. I admit, the roadster in space was marketing genius and Adam Jonas's comments regarding it on the ER call showed how little objectivity the sell side analysts have at this point. How much longer can Musk & the boot licking analysts keep propping this up w/ insane price targets? Especially with interest rates rising and their ability to raise capital drying up. So the next step is more shareholder dilution? They basically already pay their employees in shares anyway. Not to mention that battery and material costs are about to go up even more with inflation & the Congo increasing taxes on cobalt and introducing a windfall tax of 50%. So for all you Tesla bulls do you truly believe Tesla will actually make & sell enough Model 3s with so-so margins while under increasing pressure from rising costs & little to no room for error at this point to justify this valuation? Well the smart money has already decided. Go look at the recent 13Fs and all the big put buys by Goldman, UBS, Barclays, Citadel etc...",

"income machinesays Liquidity concerns (a favorite of Tesla bears) where Tesla would have to scramble to raise money to keep up with capex and other obligations seem highly overstated. Earlier this month, Tesla sold half a billion dollars of bonds, most of which came in at just a .3% premium to the benchmark swap rate and assigned the highest possible credit rating. They also have over $3B in cash to keep them from tapping the equity market again.I hope income learns the tiers of financeWhen you go to securitization your near the bottom of borrowing abilityBenchmark swap rate and assigned the highest possible credit rating.Didn't the melt down teach income nothing about credit rating as to securitization?",
"@author,""They have the audacity to continue bashing despite years of a continued elevated share price and incorrect projections.""Wrong projections about cash flow and earnings?  No, not wrong.  Bears have been correct.  And that is all that matters in the long run.  2018 projections for losses are once again increasing.  You have the audacity to print this article with nothing to back it up except the share price. No financial ratios, no cash flow, no earnings.  ""Yet even if the author is just stating her book and wrong time after time after time,""The bears haven't been wrong about the very negative and ugly financials. I have to correct you, once again. ""But let’s move onto some facts that continue to bring me confidence as a Tesla long. The revenue growth the past five years has been exponential""In case you were unaware, costs must be deducted from the revenue.  Despite the revenue growth, costs have increased more.  You fail to mention that. I wonder why. Ford and GM have positive cash flow and earnings, something that Tesla does not have, nor has ever achieved on an annual basis, and barely has achieved for but a few quarters. I think you can count those times on one hand's fingers. I also don't believe the rocket launcher's words when he states that Tesla will be operating profitable this year, or cash flow positive.  The reason is because of the failed guidance of the past. (Musk and CFO said they would be cash flow positive in 2015, then 2016, with a small caveat that that cash flow would include the ABL funding.  I have to laugh at that. Operating cash flow does not include financing cash flows. LOL) So, now you've joined the ranks of those who hedge their bets with revenue from writing articles. Congratulations.  I guess it takes one to know one, eh?Here is what the Oracle of Omaha said about bidding up a company's share price:""Bear in mind--this is a critical fact often ignored--that investors as a whole cannot get anything out of their businesses except what the businesses earn. Sure, you and I can sell each other stocks at higher and higher prices. Let's say the FORTUNE 500 was just one business and that the people in this room each owned a piece of it. In that case, we could sit here and sell each other pieces at ever-ascending prices. You personally might outsmart the next fellow by buying low and selling high. But no money would leave the game when that happened: You'd simply take out what he put in. Meanwhile, the experience of the group wouldn't have been affected a whit, because its fate would still be tied to profits. The absolute most that the owners of a business, in aggregate, can get out of it in the end--between now and Judgment Day--is what that business earns over time.""http://for.tn/1rzS5Jp",
"So the bears (except a lucky few) have lost money in the past. Timing is everything. I get that the stock price has held up well. And that’s an understatement! The same can be said of countless flawed businesses that have gone to the “moon” and eventually came crashing down. In many cases to zero. That’s how markets work sometimes. Personally, I think the bears are totally right. That doesn’t mean I am willing to be short no matter what and when. I just don’t have the stomach for it. But those that do, my guess is that eventually they will be rewarded for their patience.",
"Its so funny to read all the responses from ignorant speculators and gamblers. Most have never run a company in their life, let alone a transformative company which is disrupting several key industries. They don't have the mental capacity to understand that Tesla is BUILDING its platform to enable world wide dominance of EV, Autonomous driving, Ride Sharing, Power Storage, etc. If Tesla were to try to become profitable now it would loose its top position in the exponentially growing markets. Tesla must invest everything now and NOT be profitable. All these negative speculators scream profit profit profit, as if thats what Tesla investors want. Clearly by Teslas share price we don't! We want Tesla to destroy old auto and out of its ashes cement EV supply chains in the US. We want level 5 autonomous driving. We want world wide distributed solar and power storage. We want EV ride sharing. We want to take back control from big oil and old auto. We want freedom from endless wars. So all the shorts and bears with their Balance Sheet ( BS propaganda ) can go suck on a tail pipe. After all they love big oil and old auto.",
How is it up there? Where? Where the sun don't shine!Tesla will be a disaster--it's just a matter of time.,
"Hi, thanks for the article, I appreciate the point of view.Personally, I like Musk; he's an innovator and a risk taker. He makes (most) of his stuff in the US, and, as a US citizen, I like that. Capitalist economies need innovators and risk takers, so, ""Go, Elon"". I hope TSLA, as a company, has a long future.The issue here, though, is the valuation of TSLA shares.I recently put a bear put spread on, and liquidated at a profit, as TSLA shares followed the recent correction down to the $305 level. I've started to slowly establish more bear put spreads. For me, going forward, the key metric will be to watch the price of TSLA's unsecured bond issuance, the 5.3% of 8/2025, cusip U8810LAA1. Why am I bearish? First, TSLA is a cult stock, IMHO. I don't deny the name has panache. But consider:1. the gigafactory may well turn out to be a strategic liability; wrong battery design, not easy to retool to support different battery design, and TSLA, if I'm not mistaken, does not own any of the battery IP. Strikes me as a risky, expensive solution to source supply.2. charging network as strategic liability. If memory serves, TSLA is using a proprietary standard no one else in the US, Europe, or China uses. But what purpose does the charging network serve? Does it support the right vision for how people will use their cars? If most people ultimately want to drive their TSLA EV's 200+ miles on long distance trips, then I could see an advantage to a proprietary standard. But GM is using Bolt as the basis for its TaaS service due to roll out in 2019. GM seems to be way ahead of TSLA in AV (so does Waymo). What will GM do to build out charging? Partner with local utilities.3. TSLA has underestimated the degree of difficulty in scaling Model 3, and competition is coming. It is frittering away the 'panache' of the Tesla brand, and probably causing ill will amongst erstwhile customers, in the process.I could go on. China seems to me to be a miscalculation on TSLA's part as well. In any case, for those of you long TSLA, congrats, you have done well. But don't fall in love with the stock. If your shares have doubled, consider selling half.Best of luck to all.",

"""There are few better representations of supply vs. demand dynamics than a company’s share price.""How naive can one get?

Its irrational, and can stay bewilderingly so...until it isnt.In our 4D space of time and space, you cannot hold contradictory premises. One has to collapse into the other, as a polar event of the wave function. That may sound abstruse but its very relevant if you understand Schrodinger's cat.There was no single catalyst or event that burst the 2000 dotcom uber-bubble, it happened spontaneously, and it gained momentum, just the reverse of the momentum that inflated it. summary: inflows beget inflows... until outflows beget outflows. That is precisely what will happen to TSLA as the passive/momentum money turns negative in the first derivative. Yes I admit, I'm staggered how resilient TSLA has been in the face of mounting deception/lies, losses and delays...but IT WILL HAPPEN.AS @cparmalee has said, the QE series has supported this madness, but I'm fairly certain we wont enter QE4 or is it 5, the CB's are far more wary of the diminishing returns to the real economy, and fearful of the asset bubble QE has created.The only fact that might defer its collapse, is that TSLA is one of the most shorted (relative to free float) shares in the market: 27%.So the fundamentalists are not isolated, they are all there, and alas their presence creates a paradise for a short squeeze. But one has to have faith in something, and mine is in prices finding equilibrium vis a visa their long term discounted earnings.

A 50k model 3 is the only available product for the foreseeable future, so there is really no way to know the strength of demand...but most would assume it's significantly lower.But what good is all this demand if you aren't positioned well enough to fulfill it?  what is Tesla had 2 million reservations?

"You are utterly wrong about shorted stock putting downward pressure on Tesla stock. Yes, when shares are sold short, there is a momentary downward pressure. But once the shares are sold short, there is UPWARD pressure on Tesla stock price since all short sellers eventually have to buy back the shares they sold short. The number of Tesla shares sold short has remained pretty stable for months -- if not years -- so short selling has not put measurable downward pressure on the stock price recently. But the huge short position outstanding actually puts a floor under Tesla stock  since short sellers will be buying Tesla stock in massive quantities if and when Tesla stock drops.Most Tesla short sellers are not predicting Tesla's demise. They simply look at the market valuation, analyze Tesla's past and projected financials, and come up with a determination that Tesla stock is significantly overvalued even if Tesla achieves its Model 3 projections. Given Tesla's inability to make expensive Models S and X profitably, many Tesla observers have some doubt, I think with reason, to believe Tesla will be able to earn 25% gross margins on the much less expensive Model 3's.Tesla bulls disagree with that assessment, and support Tesla stock. Shorting Tesla is high-risk given the adoration toward Elon Musk and the company's widely-admired EV's. I am among those who have come to the conclusion that Tesla stock is totally out of sync with the company's long record of losses, weakening financial position and capital-intensive, competitive, cyclical nature of automobile manufacturing.",

"Is this author so naïve as to actually BELIEVE something Musk said? Model 3 production will be 2500 by quarter's end? But wasn't it supposed to be that by December, no wait, start of Q3, 17? Then to get everyone excited they said output was already 1000 per week. But then in late December they said it was 793/week. That's not much of an improvement! Then what about cost? Several groups that got a hold of a Model 3 and disassembled it say it would cost $40-42K to make, leaving very little room for profit and none at $35K. It does strike me as interesting to see that it costs $56K to make a Model S, but somehow it will be $28K for a Model 3 (assuming 20% gross margin). How can they remove HALF the cost? Lastly, you speak of strong demand, but why is the company keeping the reservations a secret and won't update the number? Doesn't smell like good news!",

"Image recognition is not nearly reliable enough for what TSLA is trying to do with it. Everyone knows that and while my phone still often fails to recognize me, I'll NEVER trust my life to a car employing essentially the same algorithms to drive itself.That's not going to change in the observable future because of both limitations on software (no computer can come close to the situational awareness of a human) and limitations of cameras (like number of photons falling on a pixel at given time is limited). The latter limitation is the reason LIDAR is the ONLY responsible way to pursue Level 5. Do you think the other manufacturers don't know that roads are made to be navigable by passive optical recognition? Of course they are, but they don't want to build a system which is only 99% reliable and would cost them billions in lawsuits long term.

"Tesla's AP systems are leading in one respect: they are the only ones to have killed people.Hard to buy the argument that Tesla is leading in AP when it runs into a red firetruck, with lights flashing, in broad daylight, parked on the side of the road. The ABS braking system didn't even start to slow the car down, because it didn't deploy.Consider the financial dollars arrayed at solving the driving problem. You have Intel with Mobileye; Google; Apple; and the various OEMs all throwing tons of money at this -- in teams, so the costs are shared. It is hard to see how Tesla, with a relatively tiny R&D budget, can maintain the spending level to take the lead in this multi-horse race.  Tesla lacks the financial firepower.  AP is just one of many things they have to throw money at.As far as Tesla's systems, Fact is, when Mobileye pulled the plug on Tesla, Tesla had to start from scratch -- or pretty much so, so pretty much whatever data they acquired from their venture with Mobileye, probably had to be scrapped. That put them several years back.I think it is more likely that Musk underestimated what it would take to get fully functioning AP going, and he jumped the gun, announcing it when it was nowhere near ready, thinking it was only months away -- just to create some marketing buzz: Tesla would be the only car company offering AP -- even though it was not true. At least it would help sell cars. Which he needed to do because he was running massively in the red.The problem is, people die when the Tesla AP fails to recognize certain situations.Would you trust your life to it? I would not. Say what you will, but Tesla has no live real-world deployments like Google has, so all this theoretical testing may not lead to the holy grail.Woz thinks Elon is not to be trusted, there's too much hype -- and I agree.",

"The notion of ""local maximum"" is, I think, being incompletely presented.The argument seems to be that manufacturers using LIDAR will achieve full autonomy at some point, but that the hardware-light, passive vision approach will achieve full autonomy, perhaps later but at lower cost. This is only part of the story. any autonomy system using LIDAR *inherently* creates a 3-D image of the surroundings *and only then attempts to recognize objects within those surroundings. The passive optical approach works differently. Objects are first recognized, and only then are the positions and motions of those objects determined. This difference has profound implications for how and how well the autonomous system works. But, first let's consider nature of this difference in approaches.Consider the different ways a person and a porpoise perceive their respective worlds. A person see the world in a passive optical fashion. We recognize things on the basis of what things look like. Then by referencing the size and motion of things determine their distance, trajectory and what if anything needs to be done. The porpoise on the other hand uses (primarily) sonar - which like LIDAR offers a 3-D rendition of the world. The porpoise first measures the location and motion of objects, and only then goes about recognizing the objects.A passive optical based autonomy system operates as a person does. A LIDAR based system works like the porpoise. LIDAR, like the porpoise sonar has poor angular resolution and cannot see detail at distance (e.g. it can only see 'gross shapes' at distance). Even with LIDAR, a passive vision system is needed to identify and 'interpret' objects - the wording on a sign, the expression on a driver's or a pedestrian's face, etc.A very big challenge for any autonomous driving system is to separate objects from 'clutter'. LIDAR can be particularly useful in this area because it differentiates objects from background clutter by distance. This (possibly) makes passive optical object recognition easier, but only at the cost of making the 'recognition function' a 3-D rather than a 2-D thing. This in turn makes the recognition function within a LIDAR based system different from, and generally incompatible with the recognition function within a passive optical autonomy system. In essence, the distance information obtained by a LIDAR becomes a 'crutch' for the image recognition functionality by helping to separate objects from background clutter. This may make it easier to achieve object recognition recognition initially, but the crutch will tie a LIDAR based system to having range information in order to recognize objects at all, and because this data is lower resolution, the precision and 'expertness' of the recognition function will likely be compromised compared to a fully developed passive optical based approach.The trapping at local maximum of course occurs because once recognition is perfected within a LIDAR based system, switching to a purely passive approach requires scrapping all the work, experience and 'learning' gained in the 3-D data, LIDAR environment.This trapping may not just be trapping to a more costly suite if sensors (LIDAR), the absolute recognition performance of such LIDAR based system may well turn out to be inferior to fully developed passive optical based systems owing to dependence on low resolution LIDAR data feeding the recognition functionality.",
"Value: For once I agree with you: Level5 autonomy will still take some more time than many seem to expect these days. But given this, how do you feel about Tesla selling such a distant dream for real dollars since over a year ?""hardware heavy"" versus ""hardware light"". Yes, Lidar is expensive and unhandy. But there are new technologies arising, especially ToF (""time of flight"") cameras, that deliver picturees and spatial information at the same time, at high resolution. They use no moving parts, are very handy, and have the potential to become very cheap in mass production. Paulo Santos wrote about this. I think, the future of autonomous driving is ToF.cameras plus radar.To replace the spatial information by a neural network, only fed with the visual data, might be possible, but extremely difficult, resource demanding (hardware, memory and speed), and probably less reliable. Neural networks are powerful structures, but as any machine learning algorithm, they need data, data, data. Simply replacing valuable information by neural networks is to nice to be true.",
"I understand the theoretical advantage that Elon is talking about, but isn't it worrying to you that Tesla is the only company claiming to be a competitor in the autonomous driving race who has not shown anything tangible, and does not have a test fleet operating on real roads? I mean, it's one thing to have a pile of data from your fleets, but it's an entirely different thing to actually produce a working autonomous car.Elon might not like the hardware heavy approach, but Google (Waymo) has already launched its beta test project in Arizona, offering rides to real customers. Waymo has also had its cars operating and testing on real roads, in real traffic conditions for 6 years. The theoretical concepts in Elon's mind may have potential, but there is a long road between potential and a product. Even if Elon had a great perfect working prototype tomorrow, there is no government in the world that would give him approval to commercially release that product for use on their roads without extensive real life testing in place to demonstrate it's safety.",
"LIDAR and similar technologies are the equivalent of giving a blind man a better cane. The real technology needed to bring fully autonomous driving, and many other robotic advances, into practical reality is the development of real machine vision.

The key is a brain that's able to properly interpret visual signals received by the eyes, or (in the case of vehicles) simple cameras and similar cheap sensors. Recent advances in neural networks and machine learning have shown surprising results in AI fields long thought to be a decade or more away (e.g., DeepMind's AlphaZero). We're on the cusp of these same technologies providing similar sorts of breakthroughs in areas like machine vision, speech recognition and synthesis, etc. Once this dam breaks, expect commercialization to follow with surprising speed.",

"Article is based on a MAJOR fallacy, and here I am something of an expert. I suggest you do some actual research before you personally invest any money whatsoever on the basis of this theory you propose - it is completely wrong-headed and the results will not be pretty. Ask yourself one question - why can't Teslas ""see"" fire trucks? Start here. As irritating as the sound track is, a few minutes can save you a lot of money:http://bit.ly/2BFdbRDThen too, LIDAR sensors being developed and produced now for this application will be much less expensive than you are stating:http://bit.ly/2o6Tk40Then too you should, if you are not being paid to push fallacies, stop and ask yourself why PEOPLE have the habit of running into stopped vehicles on highways? The answer is quite similar - human beings are also bad at the task of detecting stopped vehicles in front of us, which is why brake lights are so incredibly important. But even so, there is a frequent accident type which occurs when people see the brake lights and think they are coming up on a slowing line of cars, but actually it's a stopped or nearly stationary line of cars. It is not that we CANNOT see them, but that that we are not normally processing images with enough detail so that we do detect the difference between what we expect to see and we do see. In other words, the answer to this issue is that with any means of sensory input, processing large amounts of data (the whole sensor field) is energy-intensive. So all evolved methods concentrate on pulling out parts that change, and then do intensive processing/matching on them. And for that, nothing is really better than LIDAR:http://bit.ly/2BFrYf9You seem to think that there is no other equipment trade-off for LIDAR, but the problem is that there is a huge tradeoff in processing capacity required for the extra image processing. Further, for an electric car the power draws involved to accomplish self-driving purely by image processing are large enough to have quite significant range impacts, such that the 300 mile Tesla Model 3 accomplishing the task purely by image processing would probably have a range of around 80 miles in self-driving mode. You don't just have to provide electricity to run all the hardware - you also have to cool it (or sometimes maybe warm it) because all that electricity produces a ton of heat. The proof is in the power draws used for image processing in animal brains, AND HOW THEY ARE MINIMIZED. Biological circuitry (our neural systems basically work off ions) is stunningly efficient compared to electrical circuits. But even our brains with their optimized energy flows (and localized stores of ""burst"" energy through ATP reserves), can't process our entire visual field at one time. Instead they work in parallel, basically, so your operative vision when driving a car is mostly picking out instances of pre-known objects that are either moving or stationary in expected configurations. At any time when you have to do intensive image processing (such as studying irregular road surface to figure out whether it is safe or not), you are pretty much driving on autopilot (off the pre-stored mental map of path/objects/obstacles you have already generated) for a brief period of time. Abruptly, virtually your entire visual processing capacity is devoted to the task of figuring out whether that is a crater pothole on the road, tar splotches, water, a large piece of cast-off tire, or a tar stripe. Now let us turn to bats and wrens. Both are small-bodied fliers that eat insects - a very energy-intensive food source which helps to ""pay"" for their energy expenditure. They use two different navigation methods - sonar and sight. Wrens have very large heads and brains relative to their body mass. One fascinating thing about wrens is how they fly. It's kind of jittery - not as extremely so as bats, but their flight patterns, especially when nearing obstacles, look inefficient. They always change path vertically or horizontally. That should be inefficient, but probably is because they use those path changes to simplify 3-D resolution. In other words, it costs them more energy in flight, but saves them energy in image processing. Bats use sonar, and if you've ever watched a bat, it's jitter-bugging through the air like a hyperactive three-year old who just ate a bag of candy. But they have to do that to get information. In effect, both bats and wrens are making immobile objects move - relative to their own locations - in order to get information on those objects. Now, a car driving down a road cannot jitterbug, although I am informed by proud Tesla owners that on Autopilot, sometimes they do. The harried rider then disengages AP as the passengers scream for mercy. So you are left with one question: Is Elon Musk's genius capable of beating 60 million years of evolution - which always converges to the same point, btw? Because if it isn't, then the best current solution to the image-processing problem is to radically cut the amount of detailed image-processing, and LIDAR is supremely efficient in doing this.",
"There is a lot of chance that LIDAR price can be reduced drastically as the actual market is quite specialized (science, army, institutions). They don't argue on the price, and there is various kind of LIDAR depending on the application. The global market represents USD 500 millions currently.  There are improvements possible for a LIDAR specific to the autonomous car market and cheaper. This could be a million units per year volume very quickly.This can't be said for batteries. They require a large amount of material, and the evolution is very slow. Mass manufacturing of Li-ion batteries has been going for some time now.

The car is dangerous.  The autopilot needs to be bricked and then, maybe, it would be safe to drive.Google Musk quotes on autopilot.  He paints a very rosy picture that many a naive millennial will take as gospel.Shameful.",
"Just a few points.   In one sense Elon is correct.  It is possible to drive a car with just two cameras and no proximity sensors.  That is what humans do. We also learn from practice, which is what neural networks do.  Lidar is not necessary for that, and neither does it read signs or see traffic lights - for which you need a camera.  Also I understand the Google/heavy hardware approach assumes continuous network connections and very detailed background data - traffic reports etc, which is not always available, as we all know.  (On the other hand a smart phone would have been the size of a bookcase and cost a million just a few years ago, so I suspect Lidar can become a lot cheaper.)I do think it is not as simple as that.  My  own Tesla S goes crazy with ice on its proximity sensors, for example. I hope they test outside southern California. My problem with Tesla is not only the problems with production, but the continual expansion of projects.  Now the Tesla Network has become the holy grail. Hugely expensive. And SpaceX - only one of Elon's other major efforts - is now apparently getting into the business of satellite based Internet for Africa. ( Apart from sending cars to Mars. Maybe the battery was dead?) My take on his attitude we see is that he is pretty laid back because he actually has very little 'skin' in it himself any more. He is hugely wealthy and if he has sense, I am sure he already has a pension plan put aside we all would wish for. He is as happy as can be coming up with new ideas and getting others to fund them, and jetting around a world full of adulation.",
"I think the reason Musk calls LIDAR a ""crutch"" is because it gives you a detailed 3D map of your environment. Driving software doesn't just use the map... it requires it. With perfect 3D awareness the software can follow (relatively) simple logic for avoiding obstacles and obeying rules. This gets you to some kind of good demonstration system pretty quickly.To advance past the demo stage you'll need something to handle the times when LIDAR is less effective (i.e. rain, snow, fog). How are you going to do that if your software requires a perfect 3D map to work in the first place? And from there how do you get to level-5 autonomy where you'll have to deal with all the missiles mildly guided by the distracted, inebriated and emotional meatbags? At some level, it has to learn how to drive like a human... learn human intentions and frustrations and shortcuts. That is what I believe Tesla is doing.",
"I would categorize it more as a hardware heavy/software heavy approach! That said, I agree with the part about lidar being faster to market than a Tesla approach but not being scaleable. I also don’t see it being cheap enough to sell to customers but only viable in a owned and operated fleet by the automaker. But the key point in all of this is that even if Tesla lags another autonomy provider by six months, a year, whatever, once Tesla gets the software right, all they have to do is turn the switch and all cars become fully autonomous since late 2016. That is your scale right there! Over night 100’s of thousands of autonomous cars will be added to the roadways. I also disagree with you on the importance for Tesla you put on this. I can agree that it will not be that profitable for a ford or gm that has to field its own taxi service at 80k a pop per car in the fleet, but Tesla will have 100’s of thousands of customer paid for cars in their fleet. And yes, people that buy Teslas are exactly the type of people that will use their cars for an autonomous taxi service, especially if they get paid for it. Tesla owners tend to be tech centric and what cooler thing is there then letting your car autonomously earn money for you while you are at work or home. Bottom line I think the autonomy aspect of Tesla is huge to my investment thesis in the stock.",
"""Now perhaps I am wrong. In which case, I'll look like a fool. But I am quite certain that I am not.""These are almost exactly the same words he used about making the autonomous cross country trip occur in 2017 if it wasn't successful.",
"If ""shadow mode"" was infact a thing we would see1) Telemetry going from car to home base (we dont)2) A lot more hype on it from MuskCo3) Evidence of it workingWe see none of this. AP is done. Lets move on to more important things other than this failed hype",
"As usual for SA, you are quoting old news. Elon gave up on the passive optical only idea, and uses radar to accomplish the same thing as LIDAR. In many ways, radar is superior to LIDAR.",
"He's right when he says that the existing road network is geared to passive optical.  If LIDAR can't read signs, detect traffic signal colours, etc., it simply can't work well until the day that roads themselves are designed to suit LIDAR rather than optical systems.  We'll be driving cars ourselves for a few years yet, and there will be overlap - perhaps forever - between the era of human-driven and AI-driven cars.Yes, the optical method is the hard row to hoe.  But once the AI technology necessary to leverage it catches up, LIDAR will be entirely obsolete.  This is an example of thinking many years into the future, rather than simply trying to cobble something together with today's technology only.",
"Your model is totally the wrong way round, Tesla are trying to spoof the capabilities by making the best out of cheaper technology, but they will reach the local maximum and then be able to go no further, The hardware heavy companies are also using AI. Secondly the neural nets are all focused on object recognition, self driving needs way more than that, it needs to build predictive models on vehicle behaviour and to do that you need to see cars further away, Tesla with its fixed location can't do that. As a car driver do you ever lean to the left or right to get a better view? Tesla can't. And thirdly, Tesla have sadly underestimated the regulators need for features. They think 2x safer, maybe 5x safer than humans, but regulators will demand many many times safer. Inward facing cameras to observe driver behaviour on levels 3 and 4 are almost inevitable.",

"I have taken rides in some pretty ugly taxis lately. I am sure a new vehicle festooned with LIDAR and other sensors would not bother me at all. In particular, they would not be visible to me once I am inside. My primary concern will be safety and getting me to my destination efficiently. Companies that can offer real-life mobility with their ugly taxis will be gaining invaluable experience in operating the vehicles and in understanding what the public wants and will accept. It is hard to believe that this lead will be easy to overtake just by having cheaper hardware. When I take my first ride a self-driving vehicle, the real-life record of the manufacturer will be important to me, whether this is a taxi or a personal vehicle.",
"In 2015, I emphatically stated that full level 5 autonomy as being described by the hypesters (any road, any time, any conditions, any situation -- automation will be better than humans) was preposterous.  I said we were at least a decade (that would be 2024) before any fully L5 capable vehicle was available for sale.I can't tell you how much abuse I took for that.  I said what we will actually see is a series of INCREMENTAL safety and convenience features that eventually might get us somewhat close to the L5 dream.  Again, lots of abuse from people who believe in tightly edited videos that show only the most trivial of circumstances.Well here we are, 3 years later and we really have barely made any change at all in the real world.  The hypesters are still claiming the technology is getting better and better and will be turned on any day now.  But truly there is very little you can actually buy.  And the automated taxi services so far are a farce.It seems many people are coming to that realization that even 2024 is way too optimistic for the promised L5 anywhere, any time solution.I don't mention this as ""I told you so.""  I mention it so that people can factor it into their investment decision.  It simply is not happening in any significant w2ay for many years to come.",
"Will have to see how well the LIDAR works.  I expect it to come down in price and bulk and to be a reasonable choice from the footprint and cost perspective, but a couple of things concern me:1.  Even with LIDAR, you can't really escape doing the things you need to do for a non-LIDAR system.  Maybe the cost of the redundancy will be trivial.  We'll see.2.  Descriptions of LIDAR use that I've seen seem to suggest reliance on its ability to make highly accurate maps, and mapping is brittle by nature.  Things change.It will be interesting to see how it all develops.",

In the specific case of Tesla, they appear to have no sensors capable of operating at night.  For example, how could radar detect an upcoming curve in the road at night?  The answer is, it cannot.  Surely someone must have asked this question before, but I cannot find the answer.",
""" All Tesla vehicles produced in our factory, including Model 3, have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.""i.e. an inadequate sensor suite, no LIDAR, no method of cleaning cameras in bleak weather conditions, not enough processing power, no redundancy in processing units or servos.

"Nice article. But I think you are underestimating the revenue by a long shot.Netflix is raising its prices more close to 10% a year. You can see this when you study the quarterly streaming revenues, divided by number of paid subscribers. It would put the rate for Netflix at $26 in Y2027-dollars, at 5 times the present content still a bargain deal.The number of subscribers seems relatively conservative. The US and Europe both should easily get around 250 million subscribers in a decade. That leaves just 170 million for the other 85% of the planet. When you  plugin 600m subscribers at $26 a month, you get $187B in revenues. That would put the company at an entirely different level. And, this is all still excluding new lines of revenue. Content can be resold in second windows, selling merchandising on new cult-hits and new type of channels to target a wider range of audiences (sports, live-tv, etc. each with their own package). Btw. Facebook is actually a far more expensive stock compared to Netflix if you look at revenue. Netflix has $16B of subscription revenues in 2018 at a marketcap of $120B. Facebook has $56B of advertising revenues in 2018 at a marketcap of $520B. The gap is fairly big.

Competitors should vie for supplanting NFLX as the core, if they can. DIS and AMZN could do that. AMZN has an advantage of not really needing to, like the others do. It can maintain its own core position - if someone gets Prime for free shipping, then they are unlikely to cancel. But DIS needs to solve the chaos it is creating with having three services: ESPN, Disney and Hulu. That positions each of the three as an add-on...to NFLX.

"I'm a little curious. You say at the top that Netflix has a huge moat, but you don't really circle back to that in the article. What is it that constitutes Netflix's moat? Is it just subscribers/market share?I ask the question, because one of the weaknesses that I believe Netflix has, is that it has a relatively small moat, at least if you assume that it's future competitors will be traditional media giants like Disney and Comcast. Netflix has subscribers, and has hot shows right now, but, by the summer, all the new content being released right now, just becomes library content. This really doesn't count as a moat, because the traditional media giants have much larger libraries which continue to grow every day, as they continue producing content for their various platforms. Assume that Disney waited 5 years to launch its service, and assume that by then Disney would have no contractual limitations on its ability to use its library content. In that case, Disney could launch a service with a larger library than Netflix, and a slate of new shows limited only by its willingness to spend. Given the amount of powerful brands Disney owns, it could make its new slate of shows just as compelling, if not more compelling, than Netflix's slate, assuming a similar monetary investment.Now, this isn't to say that Disney will actually do any of that, but in analyzing the company's moat, that is what you are talking about, right (ie. What structural limitations are in place to prevent competitors from entering your market and claiming market share)? As far as I can tell, when looking at traditional media companies, the moat is really just Netflix's subscriber base. The programming costs really don't count as a moat, since they are really just operating expenses. In contrast, Netflix right now is attempting to use its head start in streaming to combat the moat that traditional media companies already have (ie. larger libraries of content and established brands).Obviously, this analysis changes if you are assessing competitors, or potential competitors, like Amazon or Apple, where Netflix's library does constitute a real moat. Either way, please let me know if you feel that I am missing part of Netflix's moat in my analysis.",
"Ziyaad, I'm afraid you have a fundamental flaw in your thesis.  You provide no reason to expect the kind of subscriber growth you claim, and provide no evidence as to why that growth rate will occur.US growth is slowing and the competition you mention from Disney/FOX is going to ramp up soon.  Disney has $8 billion of cash on hand and can easily access debt markets.  Netflix must continually borrow billions of dollars in increasingly higher interest debt.  You speak as if Netflix has money to burn when it does not.You are essentially postulating that, when US growth flattens, that Netflix will add something like 250 million additional international subscribers.  Possible?  Maybe.  But not in ten years, and very likely, not at all as the entire world moves towards streaming content.  A country-by-country analysis to back up your claim is really necessary here, and I doubt you'll be able to come up with anything plausible to support your claim.",
"Good article, but your subscriber projections are overly conservative. The ultimate NFLX subscriber base is asymptotic to the global broadband penetration rate. That will sharply increase once 5G gets rolling in 3 years time. My personal belief is 1 billion subscribers within 10 years is a more realistic projection. That plus annual hikes in subscription rates, and some new subscription services/tiers that don't yet exist will make today's prices look like an incredible bargain a decade out. Until the real story changes, NFLX remains a ""buy and hold"" stock.",
"Good analysis! Also small note, they won’t lose their current Marvel originals ala Daredevil. As long as they keep making those series, they have a perpetual license. They are just losing the Pay 1 window of new Disney movie release (ie. their new stuff). To the comment about future growth, we likely have a TAM of 500-700 million at current income levels/ internet speeds.  But the other level is price increases, which at the end of the tail will become more important. Good analysis, maybe a bit conservative, but isn’t it good to be conservative.",

RIG share count 541MFrom conference call regarding Songa acquisition 99.7% of Songa shares tendered.-66.9M RIG shares issued to legacy Songa shareholders-approx 850M of exchangeable bonds of which approx 560M were issued as consideration to  Songa shareholders and approx 290M to retire and/or convert a majority portion of legacy Songa  unsecured bonds.-Including exchangeable bonds on a fully diluted bases RIG shares count 541M-200M spent to retire other debt and expenses.-Assumed 1.6B net debt,
Can anyone comment on the share count increase from 458M to 541M. Is the increase less than expected?Why is the board so quiet? Usually there is more engagement.,
RIG stated they are comfortable with their fleet size and will not be retiring any more rigs in the near future. That will NOT be an issue for the balance sheet.Thigpen commented on reserve replacement now is an issue that has to be dealt with. Shale accounts for 7% of oil production and can not replace reserves needed. Deepwater is a necessary component of the oil/gas industry. Majors are back in the game. When majors show their face a recovery is occurring. The fact that RIG won all those contracts at breakeven and positive cash flow puts RIG in a enviable position. Was it DO who stated contracts were below breakeven?  Many on this board thought that was the case.,
"IMHO, the most positive comment on the RIG CC was when they stated that they have not accepted any contracts below cash flow BE.  They are clearly showing more price discipline than I expected.And even taking contracts at BE cash flow levels, while not covering all costs, is more profitable than paying stacking costs and losing good crews.However, for those who think RIG has strengthened their balance sheet, the numbers say otherwise.  Equity, as a percentage of total capital, continues to decline to 56.7% on 12/31/17, which compares to 58.8% for the year earlier.  The balance sheet clearly shows a shrinking company due to rig retirements:  during 2017 shareholder equity decline by just under $3.1 billion while total liabilities declined by $1.4 billion.  The decline in equity was almost completely due to impairments $1.5 B. and losses on disposed assets $1.6 B.Since the Songa acquisition involved much more debt than equity, the BS at the end of 1Q18 will clearly be even weaker than it was at the end of the year.  However, all in all, I thought the quarterly report was positive with the ""no below cash flow BE contracts"".  Hope the bulls don't expect EPS to turn quickly though, as I counted contracts at $592K, $570K. $456K, $433K, and $431K that rolled off either late '17 and in January '18.  The FSR shows that RIG currently has 47 active rigs (not counting the 2 NB's that have no delivery date nor the 2 JU's that have been sold and RIG is operating till end of current contracts).  Of those 47 rigs, 19 are either idle or stacked (40.4% of their fleet).",
"There is definitely a clear improvement in the OSD business. Number of awards per year is growing. Meaning offshore drilling is staging a comeback. You guys continue to focus on the negatives and none of the positives. There is no doubt that deepwater will be the last to show improvement this is no different than what has happened in the past. Transocean is the king of deepwater and when contracts are awarded you can be sure Transocean will winning many of them. The smaller drillers just cannot compete against Transocean in this area. Size matters.Importantly liquidity without revolver and rig activation is projected to be 2.2 to 2.4B.Acquiring more assets will be focused in harsh environment rigs with a good balance sheet. Assets must have contracts.Majors returning to offshore with a 'BANG'. Tendering will increase in every single market sector towards end of 2018 for 2019 and 2020.Contracts are cash flow positive! Question answered in conference call.High spec units will get awards first. As market tightens 5th generation ships will win awards next. Transocean states not all 5th generation rigs are equal. RIG will reactivate and upgrade those rigs when needed. Transocean says those rigs are good rigs and it is cheaper to use older assets than buying a company or a new rig.Shale only accounts for 7% of oil production. Ultra deepwater is a NECESSARY means for replacing reserves.Retirement of assets. RIG is comfortable where they are.RIG has patent for Dual Activity BOP, any other company drilling in Brazil has to pay RIG a royalty. RIG can outbid many drillers and still be cash flow positive because of the royalty.As I stated, majors are buying offshore blocks...reserve replacement is knocking on the door.",

If the DO CEO is correct and demand won't strengthen for years to come, it's difficult to see how some OSD's will survive unless a proactive and rapid consolidation process commences soon.What's unclear to me is how the SDRL bankruptcy might impact their debt, and subsequently their ability to profit at a lower day rate. I am not familiar with that arrangement but assume some, or all of their long term liabilities will be reduced to varying degrees. This could put further pressure on the others, including RIG.",

Don't underestimate the value of your employees. Accepting a breakeven contract allows you to keep your crews...while your competition has had let theirs go. Good crews will be hard to come by once the recovery gets under way. A good proven crew can be just as important in getting a new contract as the rig itself.,
"As an investor, I like to see a healthy industry turning back with good dayrates, but as RIG management, they need to compare their rigs internally and externally. If the contracted rigs, especially in GoM, are just a small portion of the owned fleet and not that competitive outside to the more modernized ones, turning from idle to hot with short term contracts even slightly below breakeven is not a bad idea because hot is the best ""soft"" advantage they can add to the rig for onging bidding. Crew also makes sense from others comments. Overall, as long as more work shows up, the sector is recovering. RIG won't be accepting below breakeven rates forever.",
People love Amazon for undercutting all competition and operating with miniscule margins. The share price goes through the roof. Transfer that to another industry and the perpetrator is a vulture while the stock remains at a low. Different perceptions of similar activities.,

"So, they reactivate the Asgard and India, and stack the Clear Leader and Luanda. This is an expensive game, particularly when day rates are at or near cash break-even.

Also, the Asgard and India were reactivated for relatively short term work - this just adds to the bidding pool as the Asgard and India will be looking for their next job now.",
Consider also the cost to recertify all equipment per ever more rigid and demanding client specs and it makes perfect sense to contract at BE.,
Two quarters ago the conference call included the comment and slide presentation that said RIG would be profitable above $50 BRENT. The argument against low cost deployment goes like this:  A truck driver took a semi truck load of pumpkins to market and lost $1 per pumpkin delivered the market. When asked about his problem he surmised that he would solve the problem by buying another truck. The question remains. Is RIG net profitable?or putting to work more pumpkin trucks?I trade this name. In at $7.83 out of half position at $10.50. Then sold in the money calls on the remaining position. Time will tell if the management slide was correct and RIG has sustainable free cash flow or is playing the pumpkin truck game. I protected myself in this name and am content with my very low current cost relative to value. All the best.,
"Hi, Business directories make the best decisions at your discretion looking to improve. Without knowing the dayrates is complex to know if you win or lose and how much is the difference.Simple: It is better to work than not to do it, it is better to have the equipment in operation than stacked. Best regards",
"Vlad - seems to me simplistically that RIG is bidding low and taking available jobs.  NE, RDC and ESV seem loathe to take these below cash BE contracts which in my mind makes good business sense  you can’t “make it up in volume” if you aren’t even covering cash costs.  Each additional contract actually  destroys value unless you assume the market changes and these ships are in high demand.  Which leads to my question - at what point do you anticipate significant additional investment in OSD?   As I understand it there has been significant underinvestment in OSD for 3+ years now by oil majors and this does not appear sustainable given decline rates and increasing global demand.  Shale is doing what it can but not able to fully bridge this gap long term.    If oil supply is less than demand and this accelerates believe you will see significant spike in oil prices and then shareholder questions about reserves and the need to drill in OSD (~30% of world supply).   Do you agree and what are your thoughts on timing?    Thanks for the strong contribution - GLTA",
"Vladimir - I think a major feature of a top quality SA articles is the amount of comprehensive comments it generates and this article is generating many worthwhile comments - congrats!  Does anyone know the % of total operating costs consists of the crew cost - is the majority?  Even if not, it is easy to speculate that an experienced, highly trained crew can make the difference to move a contract from break-even to profitable.  In the (on land) construction industry, breakeven and even below breakeven contracts are common and made profitable via extra/extension work.  But most no profit contracts were taken to secure/keep the qualified personnel in place.  Most construction company owners view their personnel as their only unique and critical component to profits - any firm can buy equipment and contracts.  It's the personnel and their abilities and working talents that makes the profits.  RIG's CEO certainly opening states that his personnel is top rated and maybe his contracting strategy is protecting/keeping that asset.  I don't understand if construction industry strategies can be compared to OSD industry.",

"Thank you Vladimir for an excellent report.1. Whether Rig strategy is good or bad for the off-shore industry, Who really cares about that, like saying the Shale industry is not good for the off-shore industry, this is a dogy dogy world here and if my strategy forces out the others, well, so be it but is that not really the name of the game.2. The owners of the larger Johan project, I believe announced break-even costs below 25 dollars and even lower than that, so all in all we do not really know what a break-even point is for the above contracts.3. As we know the basic business principle is that even though you are operating at a loss you keep the machinery going, a. as long as your cover your variable costs, your fixed costs are fixed so you keep going even though you are operating at a loss because no matter what you cannot change the setup of your fixed costs4. A company per se, can still have a contract and still generate positive cash throw offs. even though it is operating at a break-even point or even less than that.5. Expenses are funny really, never static, like if I have 4 rigs all within one helicopter ride from base to the rigs I can virtually bring supplies, employees at about 30% of the cost of just having 1 rig to be serviced within one day helicopter to and from a rig.And here we have a good example when you are large enough have enough money in the bank account yes, you also have the capacity to make deals, like Rig is doing here. And that is why all in all the others are, maybe just too small for this type of business, IMHO:thank you for an excellent report.",
"With all due respect to the contributor of this article and other SA contributors to articles about Transocean, I want to make the following point.  It seems that nothing this company can do is ever deemed to be a positive.  Even the apparent good news of all these new contracts is discounted as simply ""underbidding"" other offshore Drillers who are lauded door their apparent ""discipline"" (while their rigs continue to rust in stacked mode).  I suspect that if Transocean had released its contract status report and it showed little or no activity the company would have been criticized for not doing enough to get idle rigs back to work.  Even its success in the North Sea harsh-environment area is discounted by focusing on a single contract adjustment to one rig and one customer.  This type of constant criticism of the company reminds me of the comments made on the work it has done to reduce debt and extend out maturities on its balance sheet. Everything from the interest rate received to the timing of the refinancings was criticized.  The fact that Transocean has been able to successfully tap the capital markets during this horrific time for offshore drillers gets no credit at all.  And finally I take issue with the comment that by securing new contracts Transocean is making the overall offshore drilling market weaker.  Putting aside for a second that the author does not know what these new day rates are and is only speculating; I would say that any absorption of rigs from an idle or stacking standpoint to working status benefits the entire offshore drilling sector.  The reason day rates generally are still too low is because the ""Walking Dead"" offshore Driling companies that have been resurrected by our bankruptcy laws did not have to scrap their rigs and go out of business.  in fact Transocean has been the leader in scrapping old rigs and if anything should be commended for its help in trying to right-size this sector.  But forgive me for being so naive to think that anything Transocean could do could get a positive response here.",
"Thanks for this update!I dont think this strategy is really bad. It is better to have a contract basically at cash break even then have no contract at all. When these contracts end, RIG has several ""hot"" rigs and this is what customers prefer...",

If you look back at the arguments when oil began to encroach upon coal they are too identical to today's arguments for renewables v. oil to ignore. We are in a new transition period which will last a decade. Beyond that there will still be some industry dragging their knuckles(like coal still used today) with oil but it'll be mostly dismissed as foolish.,

Tesla-Neon battery and this occurs across the Australian grid.""The big battery is officially known as the Hornsdale Power Reserve, which is located at the Hordsdale Wind Farm, owned by French company Neoen. These are connected to the East Coast grid, which includes the Eastern states and South Australia. West Australia and the Northern Territory have separate grids.On the home storage battery front, I would also like to put in a plug for hybrid flow batteries from Redflow; they are said to maintain their maximum charge over time, in contrast with lithium ion batteries where the maximum capacity can degrade over time. These hybrid flow batteries can also fully discharge without any degradation of capacity, are easier to recycle at end of life, and can be stored at zero charge with no degradation.

The negative crowd seems to have lost all perspective of anything ever happening that is positive so a self inflicted blindness to the good is becoming laughable.

Battery storage at the residential level is not cost effective. Maybe in Australia but their electric rates are crazy extortionate high. Or Hawaii where residents pay more than $0.40/kWh. But it's a very intriguing proposition. Battery storage mitigates the intermittent nature of solar and wind. I was thinking about the two AP1000 nuclear reactors abandoned in South Carolina after spending nearly $10B on them. And now they are projected to never be cost effective. Solar and wind start to look pretty good in the face of that fiasco.,

If it's not obviously compelling to put panels on a 200,000 sq foot new build warehouse roof, or a 50,000 sq ft strip mall, why is retrofitting 5 KW of panels on an existing 2,000 sq house a better deal?Albeit there are exceptional cases where a user is willing to pay a premium for at least partial grid independence (this would include me).

"Has anyone here noticed that the GSE's PPS has been decreasing along with mREITS and the whole housing market in general? The media is overplaying the increase in interest rates which does have a part in it but it's not the only problem in my opinion. Most journalists don't understand economics, history. politics etc. so they don't know. I believe that Trump's bankster tax cuts are a far bigger problem.Why?The corporate tax cut is really a huge tax increase on the middle-class. The most you can write off on your income tax is now capped at 10k, With property taxes at 15k and increasing rapidly. You can only write off 2/3rds of your property tax ( for now but that will probably decrease in the future). Home insurance has also increased exponentially so with a cap of 10K you cannot write that off. Repairs, water, sewer etc. are other things that cannot be written off.Don't forget that the Obamacare penalty is still out there. Without the write off's, most people won't qualify for the subsidies. So with this huge tax increase on the middle-class and the Obamacare penalty out there. This is going to cause another housing crisis which will lead to another financial crisis. The banksters have already taken all of their bailout money out of the country.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalized to bail out the banksters and now they don't have any capital. So they can go bankrupt at any time which will immediately increase our national debt to 25 trillion. This time there won't be any agencies to bail out the banksters so the 25 trillion dollar debt can go to 50 trillion and probably increase exponentially.I think and believe that the banksters plan to bankrupt America. Which is probably why they chose Trump to be the president. If anyone has any experience in bankruptcy it's him.",

"Glen I wonder if you or others have seen this document Treasury put out two days ago and have any thoughts about it, the proposed so-called Chapter 14 bankruptcy:http://bit.ly/2sPtkkyThis document deals with large complex banking institutions, not Fannie and Freddie. But I wonder if we can draw some conclusions. Here are my thoughts and I'd be interested in others' thoughts:1) If you superimpose the thinking from Treasury behind this document on the predicament of Fannie and Freddie, then there is both good and bad to consider (see below).2) Bad - The Federal Reserve and the FDIC together will determine whether a private financial institution will be taken over by the Chapter 14 process (not any better than Treasury and FHFA in the FnF situation).3) Bad - Upon takeover, all senior management and the entire board is fired and assets are transferred to a new ""bridge"" corporation under private control and ownership (but it's not specified who the new owners are or how they are chosen).4) Bad - Shareholders and capital structure debt-holders (almost all debt) is left behind in the remnants of the old corporation to undergo receivership/liquidation.5) Good - Any assistance provided by the Government to ensure the bridge corporation is solvent and functioning (since it is integral to the health of the economy) has to be either in the form of loan guarantees or OLA funding. It CANNOT be in the form of equity ownership.6) Good - Equity in the bridge corporation is held in trust for the sole benefit of shareholders and debt holders left behind in the old corporation.Now, I know that Fannie and Freddie are not banking institutions so this is not applicable and I also know that they were never insolvent in 2008 so they wouldn't/shouldn't even be discussed in this context, HOWEVER, we all know what happened don't we?If we imagine that Fannie and Freddie had gone through a chapter 14-type process back in 2008, then it would have made it extremely easy to wipe the shareholders off the face of the Earth never to be heard from again. New management is free to re-write the books (as they did in conservatorship for FnF) and then sell whatever assets based on the new pricing to some private investors (e.g. TBTF banks?), totally screwing existing shareholders. So I view this Chapter 14 proposal as a bad thing to anyone who believes in the rule of law or fairness. That's how I see it. It is potentially more codification of the slippery slope toward a muscular central Government that can take over corporations at will during a crisis and sell them to cronies.This document also shows that Treasury has been very busy. This is quite a big document and a lot of time and thought went into it. The Chapter 14 idea was discussed by the Hoover institution, who has generally been very favorable to the plight of shareholders in Fannie and Freddie (Epstein has written quite a few articles for Hoover).What this all means to our present situation, I have no idea. But it gives a glimmer of insight into what Treasury is thinking.Interested in others' thoughts, if any.Thanks,Sotiri",
"as I posted yesterday on another thread, according to Thomson Reuters, there is a new position in FNMA as at Dec 31 on behalf of a core value manager with $760 million under management: it acquired 5.9% of FNMA common.",
"the Supreme court ruling validated the status of common vs PF, which is roughly equal! To think that the preferred holds senior claims and could be converted into common at the huge expenses of common shareholders is just a fantasy of preferred holders. the reality is that this is very different from any normal bankruptcy case where the creditors and equity owners will be awarded pay-in-kind according to capital structure ranking. Here FNMA will never be declared bankruptcy or it will be game over for both common and preferred holders, thus final payout will be subject to NEGOTIATION, NOT RANKING OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE. preferred be converted into common and leave just a bit for common will not go anywhere. don't listen to me, check out all similar historical restructuring cases out there. with all due respect, preferred holders, wake up from your delusion, all preferred and common will be equal claims in any successful restructuring of FNMA.",
I just realize that very few people here know the political landscape around f/f. There’s no value in commons and no body really care about the common,
"Ackman’s proposal to reform FNMA and FMCC suggests possibly future value for them between $23 and $47 per share. And now, there is finally serious talk of reform going on in Congress.That is the real price for the common minus the naked short selling by preferred shareholders like Glen Bradford, Bruce Berkowitz and their friends on Wall Street.Why Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae Stocks Are Potential 10-Baggershttp://bit.ly/2GbY9CC",

Use $33.239B, which in reality is peanuts, get them to sign a waiver, and presto........they are gone. If Trump/Mnuchin are good negotiators, they could probably get 75% of face at this point. If it is QUICK and CLEAN, the jrs. would go away....at a discount no less.....I think your 'all or nothing' outlook is weird. One should own BOTH if they believe in the F&F story. JMHO.Nationalism? I own a decent chunk of many jr. preferreds, I can assure you Nationalism was the last thing on my, or anyone else who I know who also owns chunks of jr. preferreds minds. Just want the pecking order of capital in a Receivership honored, as well as the RULE OF LAW.Ackman may or may not have done the wise thing. I think it was unwise, but trust me we both make out if he is right. Ackman's avg cost for tens of millions of common shares is $2.29 for FNMA, $2.14 for FMCC.

"It should be obvious to everyone out there right now that Glen Bradford has a Long/Short Equity strategy in which he is working on right now. How else is he going to pay his margin debt?Long/Short Equityhttp://bit.ly/2CaJ45vThe real fools here are not the common or the preferred shareholders. The real fools are the common shareholders who believe that Glen Bradford is on their side. I know of no other stock in the entire stock market where preferred shareholders had it out for the common shareholders. So think about it, who started it all? Why did Glen Bradford kick everyone in SeekingAlpha who was long the common shares out?Every author that used to post positive reviews on the common shares is either out of work or they have moved on to other pastures. If Glen is not using a Lon/Short strategy then he is obviously working for Bruce Berkowitz who wanted to buy the GSE's from the government and to destroy the common shareholders. He is the only other guy beside Glen who would like to see the common shareholders destroyed.This is why I'm glad that SCOTUS denied the preferred shareholders their rights. Hopefully, the government will go even further by wiping out the preferred and exercising the warrants. This would be a huge win for the common shareholder since we wouldn't have to pay the preferred shareholders anything.As for the false rumor that preferred come before the common. Its true but that is only if they had rights but since SCOTUS has done away with all of that in this latest ruling. I don't see that happening especially since that would destroy the government's share of the commons when they exercise those warrants. The government has full control over here and they can do whatever they want. They are not going to destroy their own shares. Another thing, if SCOTUS had ruled in favor of Preferred shareholders then the GSE's would have had to pay back all of the dividends. Which go all the way back to when they stopped receiving dividends. The preferred shareholders would not have stopped at that either. They would have also demanded that they are paid back with interest. There is no way that the government would compromise their 79.9% of the common shares by allowing that to happen, especially if they have full control of the situation.Bill Ackman knew this and this is why he chose the common over the preferred. Many people wrote him off as dumb and stupid. Now we are beginning to see just how smart he was all along. This also explains to us why Corker had it out for Ackman rather than Berkowitz even though Ackman was not really suing the government.",

Any idea on shareholder-owned utilities? Will current shares follow? I’m confused at this point.,
Is it a sign when you don't hear about Fanniegate by Bartiromo or Bove?  Did they throw in the towel?,
"It is reasonable for the US Supreme Court not to accept the Fannie and Freddie case. Taking over this case will put the Supreme Court in a dilemma: If the plaintiff wins the case, the U.S. government will lose both money and fame. This is not in the interest of the country. On the contrary, if the plaintiff is defeated, the Supreme Court's reputation is thrown into the pit It went further and further confirmed the fact that this was an outright banana republic. Such a hot potato, how dare the Supreme Court take over? Since the Supreme Court does not accept the Fannie and Freddie case, this paved the way for the administrative solution to the problem. Because as long as Fannie and Freddie shareholders think they can get more generous compensation through legal channels, any administrative solution will not be accepted by the private shareholders. When the legal channels are basically closed, everyone's eyes will turn to administrative solutions. So from now on it is the best time for an administrative solution to the problem. For the Fannie and Freddie reform, the Moelis proposal is a famous plan. Compared with other programs, this program is more able to take into account the interests of shareholders. However, this solution is not radical enough or inspiring. Now I hereby provide a “zhugang proposal” for  your consideration.1. The $ 180 billion capital reserve required by both companies is lump-sum disbursed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.2. The U.S. government exercises fully the warranty to convert its preference shares to nearly 80% common shares. How these common shares are sold and how long they are sold will be operated by the relevant government departments according to the market price fluctuation. In short, the government has full discretion in this regard.Explanation: Although the Fannie and Freddie’s capital buffer comes from the U.S. government, once the capital is in place, the stock price of common stock soars. In future common stock prices can rise to about 50 US dollars per share level. By selling common stock at this price level, the U.S. government can gain 500 billion to 600 billion U.S. dollars. deducting the aforementioned 180 billion U.S. dollars in expenditures, the government's net income is much higher than the 100 billion U.S. dollars one-time compensation set out in the Moelis Plan. So my program seems to cost the U.S. government a big deal (180 billion U.S. dollars). But it is a small money exchanging for big money. Enable the  government to make more money. On the other hand, as the stock price has risen to such a high level, the shareholders will be happy. This is a happy win-win situation or “the Pareto Optimum Situation”. The Fannie Gate Issue has been making US government morally totally ugly. It is fare that the injured shareholders should receive reasonable compensation. Higher stock prices can quell shareholder resentment. Help to heal the wound, so that this nation will be able to turn over this very shameful page of history as soon as possible. I believe the above words will become the words uttering at the bottom of his heart for Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to himself. However, he will never ever speak it out in public. This is a very political way for a politician like him.",
"I am willing to wait !!  It appears that the shoe is now on the other persons foot.  The Government will now have to come up with the money to loan back to Fannie & Freddie and where are they going to get this money?  They already have put in place Tax Cuts, new plans for Infrastructure and increased Military Spending.  Good Luck.I say the Administration will feel the squeeze way before Congress does.",
"The following quote is news to me, from Reuters (who I tend to generally view as a reputable news source):""Both companies are now under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said before taking office last year that the companies should be returned to private control but has since said that they should not be privatized.""Has anyone else heard that Mnuchin is now on board with the government just keeping the companies forever?  Fold them into the FHA, perhaps?",

"If you are a preferred stock owner, face it. Today you just officially became a bag holder. No amount of ""As preferred shareholders, we always come first!"" is going to help you. The government holds warrants to buy the common. I know of no one who would exercise their warrants for a cheap price.This win in the Supreme court is a huge win for common shareholders. We no longer hold any debt. Even if the government exercises their warrants they will do so when it reaches a $20 price tag as it came out in Bill Ackman's report. He was right all along. He didn't panic and neither should we.Government wins, common shareholders, taxpayers win and pretty much everyone in the US wins since the GSE's provide a valuable service. The only losers here are the loud mouth bragging and lying preferred shareholders. They got too greedy and now they are the needy. Who said justice won't prevail. Just wait and see!",
Why are GSE's stuck in the mud?  Congress does not have the votes to make the kind of changes Corker and others are asking for.  The Democrats have no reason to rush into any kind of rescue plan because they feel good about the chances of getting back into power perhaps in both chambers; so why settle for a GOP plan that rewards their friends.  Another reason is Mnuchin promised during his confirmation hearing that he would defer to Congress before making any reorganization to the GSE's which I'm sure he regrets doing.  Mel Watt knows he has a future if he waits till November; why stick your neck out.  What I'm saying is times are running out for Mnuchin.  Is he going to move on it or what?,

There is a lot of enthusiasm on ihub.",
"This loss for the preferred is a major win for the common. The company is now debt free so our common is worth more. This is probably why Corker concentrated all his hate on Bill Ackman rather than Bruce Berkowitz. He must be behind all of this.Since the government owns common but not preferred there is far better chance that the common will come out of this. Even if we are diluted, just look at AIG!",

"Thank you Glen. If anyone here is tied up like a pretzel, you are NOT ALONE. Preferreds remain the place to be. If you don't own some, GET SOME IMHO. Having said that, I couldn't resist picking up some FMCC commons at $1.60. My first commons purchase in a while, and a buy-back of some shares sold Jan/Feb of 2017. Why commons and not preferred? Preferreds have held up, while the commons have gotten crushed recently. Price now waaaay below Benzinga's fire-sale price/value, and that is even AFTER Benzinga's theoretical 35% markdown. It wasn't a major purchase. I think it is more important that it was FMCC. I will not be buying any more FNMA preferreds or common unless there is a major dislocation between the two GSEs. FMCC needed less of a Treasury draw and paid back the USG draw much earlier than FNMA. MHO is to purchase FMCC common and preferred vs. FNMA ceteris paribus.Amazing that Mnuchin/Treasury left room on the table for FMCC to take ANY draw. ANY FMCC draw could have been easily avoided. Think of what might have happened if FNMA took $3.7B and FMCC requested NO DRAW. This should easily have happened, but it didn't. There is some reason for this. Some 'force' -- either benign or evil. I don't know which, other than Mnuchin/Watt WANTED BOTH GSEs to make some type of draw request. Would luv the Supreme Court to take a F&F docket, but I am concerned a Sotomayor, Kagan, Breyer, Kennedy, Roberts, and especially......a Ginsburg would wind up bending us over and using the sandpaper dildo. Realistically we can only count on a Thomas, Alito & Gorsuch to do what's right. I'd love to add Breyer, Kennedy, and Roberts, but Roberts allowed Obamacare to survive (just like RINO McCain) and who knows how the wind would blow? Okay, Kennedy voted against Obamacare, so again with a RINO like Roberts it might be 5-4 against. This would crush us all....Keep twisting (like a pretzel) that Berkowitz and Ackman lightened up so much (yes, they continue to own) and why Capital Group picked up so much common. Continue to believe they might have been 'forced' via redemptions, but I am hoping it was the 'optics' that they were going to make a boatload of $$$ shortly in 2018 and Mnuchin/Trump pressured them to lighten their eventual take. Gosh I hope this is the reason. No one runs a marathon to stumble a mile to the end. Capital Group might be buying back what they hold circa 2008-9. IF there is a 'record date' established bailing out Capital Group or Bill Miller, I will scream from the highest mountain, since I am an owner circa 2013/14. BTW, we need to set up a West Coast get-together, though if things work out well, I have no problem meeting in Florida. Just would need to stop at Lake Toho and Okeechobee first to hook some largemouth bass. Berkowitz/Ackman might have expected the draw request to have more of a negative effect. The draw appears to have had an effect, just way more on the common. The preferreds seem to be holding....of course this could change. Pretzel anyone?I'm not going anywhere as with others on this Board. I even removed my last 'par' $25/$50 sell limit orders on some of the Jr. Preferreds I own. I am in for the duration.I continue to experience an empty feeling that the USG could let this go on so long, as truly there is no end in sight other than Mnuchin's comments as to a 2018 timeline and the belief that a Trump Admin would treat shareholders far better than a Clinton one. I also feel for holders who have been around a long time. Mortgage payments/payoffs, college costs, donations, vacations, estate plans, an updated car, medical expenses.... have undoubtedly been held off while waiting for the right thing to be done.

When the Government intrudes into the private sector and CONFISCATES companies, using gangster-like tactics of racketeering to extract every last dollar of their income -not to belabor here the nefarious subterfuge of directing these monies to fund OBAMACARE shortfalls- it has lost all claims to moral righteousness.That a CRIME of this magnitude gets mangled with connivance of the Courts in simply unconscionable.

So why use IBM where he probably either broke even or lost a little, why not use Dexter as an example of Berkshire's investment ineptitude.  RE: Novartis looking at exiting the US marketThat is actually great news for TEVA.  It would be like Russia deciding to get rid of their oil assets.  If Novartis decides to exit the business, first you will get a price and multiple for the sale which is helpful for real-time valuation.  Second, the buyer will most likely rationalize the generic portfolio which will allow for more rational pricing. Rational pricing is all Kare has asked for, and the ingredients are there for the market to be more rationally priced in '18 and '19.   What many of you TEVA bears failed to account for is the pricing in generics is cyclical, there have been multiple downturns in pricing and they have all ended by companies like TEVA consolidating the competition, cutting costs, and eventually raising prices.  What really saves the generics is the FTF opportunities that come about every 7 to 10 years where a handful of blockbuster drugs go off-patent or are challenged and generic companies undercut the branded companies and push payers to use the generics.  This part of the cycle is upon us right now, and it is being completely ignored by the TEVA bears.  The size and scale of this FTF market opportunity was enough for me to take the risk, maybe BRK is thinking the same thing.  All of the information that you use was baked into the stock at 11, and it is also baked in at 20.  When the generics market has turned the price of the stock will be 30, and will have already reflected that turn in the market.",

"How about: 1. Yes TEVA’s blockbuster drug has new competitors now but they have been bringing out new generic drugs for decades and will continue to do so for decades to come. Most other companies need to bring out new products and only get price advantages for 1-2 years max. (TEVA CEO said that is the key to the business at the JP health conference.) 2. The 3B cost cuts are considered conservative and still able to rationalise supply chain further. 3. Probably can still save money from reduced sales footprint (Amazon alliance with BH possibly thinking like this.) 4. BH, AMZN and JP can’t suddenly deliver drugs cheaper to their employees as promised, so TEVA likely part of the story - possibly even an acquisition target with further costs stripped out. 5. The top analysts that cover the stock have already factored in about 10% further price erosion and negative growth for key TEVA drugs and still valued the stock at around $23 short term...... Am I drawing a long bow? Sell all your stocks if you don’t believe a company can bring out new products and get price advantages ever again. Who can guarantee that with any stock they own?

"Yes the Berkshire express is not foolproof but keep in mind that TEVA is trading around 8x earnings - less than half the market multiple so a lot of bad news is already baked in.    I agree that  the actavis deal was a bad one and Teva has way too much debt, but new management is trimming debt and is lowering their break even point with an aggressive cost cutting plan.   The bears have overstayed their welcome and this stock is headed back to $35 by early 2019 - lots of short covering will help Berkshire and other longs get Teva stock there.",

The newest offshoot is the about to be released documentary by Dr. Saray Stancic, who now practices Lifestyle Medicine in New Jersey. She previously was an MS patient for a dozen years, and on a handful of medications, but she healed herself by switching to a Whole Foods, Plant-Based diet, and was pronounced free of MS. Subsequently, she gave up her previous career path and opened up shop as an independent practitioner of Lifestyle Medicine, which practices prevention over pills, based on ""let food be thy medicine,"" and specifically the WFPB nutritional framework. This work is revolutionizing medicine and the number of practitioners is growing rapidly. I am seeing similar trends in my native Holland, where doctors are leaving their (much more efficient!) single payer national healthcare system, where they feel they have become legal drug pushers, and one after the other they go in search of providing better medical care, which is no longer possible within Pharmageddon (Dr. Esselstyn's term).

"One interesting trend is ""population health."" Driven by the US Government's role huge role as a payer of healthcare services, PH basically ties some compensation to hospitals, etc. to improvement in the overall health of their patient populations.  This is quite different from today's  normal approach, which is paying a set rate for specific procedures, tests, and medications performed on a single patient.  PH will have at least two obvious effects: (1) it creates a market for measuring and analyzing data on a pool of patients. ""IoT sensors (e.g., out-patient heart monitors maybe) to gather data, and analytical services to identify highest-risk (or perhaps highest reward/risk) individuals in the patient population are being created (along with new systems of reporting PH metrics to the PH payers.) (2) PH will have the effect of diverting public healthcare resources (i.e., tax dollars) from better-insured, more responsible, and healthier patients toward poorer, less motivated and less-healthy patients.  Whether you consider this a good thing or a bad thing probably depends on your political point of view. I am not at all expert on this topic.

"Are you sure about the reason for the ""lines of customers"" - often jammed at the single entrances and certainly at the head off their ""cute beige cafeteria counters"". It's because their facilities lack the engine to drive anywhere near the growth that appears to be anticipated by a 49.4 PE . Their thru-put is severely throttled-back. One factor is a single POS station (Taco Bell had what - 4 before Mr. Niccols got there). As far as new ""day-parts"" and a new menu  mix - the facilities are unlikely to support anything really new without substantial rehab. That's  been part of the problem all along. At T.B food not served is held safely in refrigerated states for the next meal.

"Just sent in a check for my non resident tax to the state of New York arising from my ownership of some units of Alliance Bernstein.

All other firms either credit their flow number withreinvestments or exclude distributions all together from flows, placing them inperformance or “other”. If AB were to report flows the BofAML way, we estimate thatits 2.7% aog in ’17 would be closer to 4% (i.e count reinvested distributions as inflows).The fact that AB already posts above avg aog with the most conservative style isimpressive and thus we reiterate our Buy rating on AB, our top pick, given its favorableflow outlook, margin upside, ~20% discount valuation, >9% yield, and margin upside.Long AB in a taxable account.

Also you don't have to have too many units before you may be required to file one or more state income tax returns, for the state of New York and possibly other states.  This is easy to handle in my experience with the TurboTax Premier software, the only drawback is that they charge you $30 for each state return.

"- last year atvi published Destiny2 and COD WW2, both of them were huge hits and in top 3 best selling games of 2017. Does Atvi stock even moved at that time? No.- Sony (and Capcom) has just published Monster Hunter World, sold 6+ Millions copies, and a few Millions on Shadow of Colossus. Does the stock even move? NoWhy? Because every thing is already priced in. If you invest based on information that everyone already knew, and you come late to the party, then you would be a bag holder. Now look at TTWO, the hype of RDR2 is already priced in since last year, that’s why its share price went up 100%. Now the potential risk is already more than potential rewards. If RDR2 is a huge hit like expected, maybe the stock move a little bit (or won’t even move at all). But if it fails (remember, it is implemented microtransaction which is very risky right now,) like battlefront2 then, well, needless to say...Remember in gaming, it is very hard to defeat the shadow of an extremely successful game.

No game can be said to be more overarching in concept, awe-inspiring in execution; no game has ever rivalled its success.The same Rockstar founder and genius who made it also made 6 of the previous titles in the GTA series, all highly successful.If you were the other two principals of Rockstar Games, how would you choose to behave towards this equal partner who was the technical and creative mind behind this achievement?1)  Reward him amply with praise and shower him with financial compensation while looking forward to the next big hit.2)  Place him on 6-month unpaid leave, pack all his things while he is away, change the keys to his office, dismiss him from the company, and get involved in a nasty lawsuit over $150 million in earnings.One of these is exactly what was done.",

Congratulations Nitin! Your bulling thesis is starting to play out so soon after this article was published. SWN was up 20.5% on Mar/2 on a volume of 51.6 million shares.,
Or not the growth in NGL as a % of total production reduce the assumed growth in dry gas production that the bears are counting on ? And if so by how much ?The SWN transcript today does focus on NGLs.,
The Natural Gas Business will be a lot better in 2019 than 2018.  Lotsa LNG capacity and a lot of incremental power burn.  So its probably time to start accumulating SWN.,
How should they use the neary $800mm in cash? Can they pay down sooner and reduce interest expense?,
"What is SWN worth? Why is RRC trading $10 higher or almost 300% when their EPS in 2018 is virtually identical? The answer lies in accumulated depreciation which is a paper liability on the balance sheet....but in reality those assets written off are worth loins share of the original value..In a sale, a new company can eliminated the accumulated depreciation and start at zero...In essence, SWN is worth many times what it is currently trading at..they should sell the company for a minimum if $15 to $20 for the benefit of shareholders and call it a day..the w=hole thing has been a scam and stupid management has allowed it to happen",
McDep Oil and Gas. Damn IPad.,
McDep Oil and Has has WTI at $70 long term and dry gas ar $3.5-$4. SWN in that world is a lot higher from here. The management changes announced today show they understand it and will monetize the opportunities for them with the massive Marcellus reserve base they have.,
"Several pipelines that are being built to take gas from the Utica and Marcellus have been shut down due to one regulatory infraction or another.  Folks up there just don’t like pipelines.  There are many many gas gathering and processing facilities being constructed in the Permian and Eagle Ford fields to send gas to Corpus Christi, Houston, and points East.  The gas from those areas is secondary.  The oil produced is primary.  As long as the oil commands a price that makes producing the field profitable, wells will be drilled.  The price of gas will continue to be depressed because of the excess gas from these fields does not control operations, but is a supplement to there operation.",

"Agree with the following --SWN bought the land that they are now only beginning to reap the rewards for. they are going to produce less than 350BCFE in 2018,but in 2019 their production there should grow like crazy-- if the price of oil and gas doubles. Anything is possible, but I have to wonder what that will do to demand and the economy.What bothers me is that value investing has been annihilated. If recovery was so good, why the centralization of so much power to Wall Street's financialization (screw accounting) of the Main Street economy. We are in big trouble. In investing it should be the underlying fundamentals which ultimately determines a market's fate. If debt was a useful product, we would be the number one good super power of the world. Instead we have become the number one bad super power of the world.",
"SWN has a lot of acres that just has no value as far as trying to make a profit through production. They purchased a lot of acres from CHK with a lot of wells on it that needs $150 oil and $5 gas. SWN simply ended up shuting those wells down. CHK is more of a lease real estate business in the hope of flipping lease properties. CHK has and continues to drill worthless to near worthless holes in hopes of hitting it big to make a property more sellable. Sitting on all of that lease real estate on borrowed money has been a financial disaster. SWN is not making any more money per well then CHK is, and the reason for that is CHK does have some hot spots where well production is superior. If you loose an average of $100,000 a well, how many wells do you need to pay off debt? In our economy there is $1 available to pay $40 worth of debt. The other $39 has to be renewed. Can old debt be paid with new debt? Yes. But did you pay the debt. No.",
"SWN has the same problem CHK and so many other energy producers have. More money goes into a well then what comes out after all of the overhead is figured in. Then you end up high grading the best and leaving the rest. It is easy to put a number on all of this lease valuation but it is a lot harder to sell it. Both companies suffer from having lots of acres they can't sell without paying someone to take it. Both companies would love to get rid of leases if only they could get out of it what they got into it. You could sell the best for more then what you got into it but then that would hurt present or future production. Both SWN and CHK and many others are in a world of hurt that is self inflicted. What good is having a shit load of leases that is costing money to maintain if it can't be turned into profitable energy production. To sell it they got to prove up resources  and that costs money. Both companies are in a hell of a pickle. Both have to get rid of debt, and that is not happening by production below the real cost of production.",

Based on the Sept. 10-Q they will spend over $1B in 2017 as well. If they perpetually spend this kind of capex, it is difficult to support higher valuations.",
"I do see fantasy in SWN as well. The PV10 i believe is at 5.8 B as most reccently, Which would bring the value where is it at the moment when we calculate in net debt, however yes its always fluctuate, so there is never an accurate number on that one. What i noticed is the ever heavy capex what the company need and needed to pump back in. In fact in many years more than its actual cash flow. As this business is an always heavily declining production operation the capex just to maintain production levels already pretty high,just look at what happend in the past few year when cap ex went lower so did struggle the production. So what more interesting to me if someone could tell what is the minimum cap ex just to keep production capacity at place annualy where is it today? So they replace and maintenance current declining capacitySomeone mentioned before accurately: As many investments firm worry about the interest rate hike, it could bring a meaningfull dent on SWN operations and profitability exspecially at low nat gas prices. The asset sale sounds great if they get a good price most of the company problems will be pretty much gone, i like the new pipeline projects,and the efficiency initiatives to delliver their own water. Worth to mention additionally a meaningfull part from their current cash they cant touch under the current revolver credit facility agreement?!

"How dependent on the price of Nat Gas is this company? Is it a direct relationship or an inverse relationship to the price?  That is really important moving forwardThere have been several articles about the glut of natural gas particularly in Canada. A couple of articles by by Davis Addison  from October/November of 2017 suggest long term pricing issues, and he recently (late January) made a comment on one of his articles that i have taken a bit from here:""If anything, the futures market for AECO is steepening in contango, indicating that the market expects no supply shortages in the coming years. It even indicates sub C$1/GJ prices are likely this coming summer. This is going to be painful since $1/GJ starts to get below the cash costs of even low cost producers. This is the cost of a price war.The counterbalance to this is that the lower the prices go, the more economic regional methanol, petchems, and LNG projects become. This is the gist of the ""Battle for Dawn"" series. If we see a major LNG project go FID as a result, I am sure speculation would cause a major pop in prices. However, it would take at least a few years between FID and FOC before the demand would actually pick up.""",
"I am a bull, but you forgot the debt side of the equation. debt is $4.6B gross or $3.8B net (after you deduct ar and cash and add ap). You also forget that part of the net income is the fact the company is capitalizing $115M of interest (adding to their cost on the balance sheet unlike presenting it as an expense) and they capitalize $90M of expenses the same way. the rational is that the interest is to carry the land and the expenses are improving the land on the balance sheet. these  are legitimate arguments and many companies do it, but just realize what the p&l  number is about. I believe the company's $5.8B enterprise value is probably the worth of their southwest land alone once they are fully in development mode of it producing  500BCF of mostly ngl and condensate in 2 years...",
The bear case is the overwhelming number of American E&P companies have executives that are paid based on production. This results in growth at all costs even into a glut and subsequent erosion of shareholder value.,
"the bear case for SWN is that the market has no confidence that nat gas prices are going to the magical $3.50  except for short temporary weather related spikes.SWN has to play for time , in 4 or 5 years perhaps demand will be significantly higher due to exports. as you can see from the present price ,nat gas exports are not remotely high enough at present to  move nat gas prices up and keep them there. for SWN to work you may have to be very patient.",
Thank you for the overview of SWN.  I agree that SWN and the natural gas sector are long term value plays.  I am long SWN and will be buying more on any further pullback.,
"agree, gas is long term play  definitely at these valuations should see 30%+ return before year end.",
"I agree on the above but there must be a credible bear case that is able to keep the stock price this low.If it is not SWN's profitability - with P/E 2018(e) at 4 - 5 profitability is not an issue -  and if it is not debt maturity - with no serious debt payment before 2022 it is not debt maturity either - then what is the bear case? I cannot see it and that troubles me. Could it be that the pipe-lines will not have have enough take-away capacity, could it be that locally natgas for SWN is expected to be priced very low, or could it be a phantasy about natgas staying at 2.5 forever? What is the bear case?",

Snappy idea, particularly given the whole Socratic method of your posts in general. Toss those ideas and facts out, and let the commenters have at-em. Nice way to learn things. Speaking of ancient Greeks, love your reference to Aesop and his fable of the golden egg laying goose. Hopefully our IM twins will heed the lesson. One of the stories surrounding Aesop was that he was a slave and something of a jester, who through his fables won his freedom.

"jbw, I typically buy small, high risk/reward off-the-radar stocks---ones that don't have options, or if they do are thinly traded and seem inconsequential.  I admit that when I occasionally buy stocks like MU I'm largely ignorant of the effect that options play.  It's a need-to-know basis kind of thing, and up til now, anyway, I've done ok w/out knowing.  Is there general agreement in the professional investment community that there is such a material effect under certain conditions, in this case that are met by MU?  If so, is it supported by vetted, PhD-caliber research?  And what are the mechanics of that effect?  Why hasn't the effect itself been arbitraged away?

"Thank you, William.  This article represents a rare overview of the fundamentals at hand, and presents a well summarized perspective for investors who might not follow this industry closely.  The grand scheme of things is actually quite bright at the present time.  Let's all hope that NVM matures in it's adoption across all memory and storage markets.I've invested in this progression since 1998 via ECD and particularly, found Slide 12 of this ASML presentation compelling (first posted by Stephan Botski here on SA).http://bit.ly/2C5ekCI",
"@WT, interesting post.  All that enthusiasm for XPoint, a product that has barely affected the market so far?  Maybe there's a more effective Gen2 part that they haven't even told us about yet?I doubt the NVM effect (if any!) will be that drastic on DRAM demand, perhaps it will slow growth but no way it will decrease demand.  The preceding similar event would be the addition of cache memory to processor chips, circa 1980 (?).  Actually, since the cache helps hide the problems in accessing large banks of memory - it allows you to install larger, slower banks!  It's all driven by price/performance, which is driven by process, which is driven by physics - and engineering ingenuity and success.I think that comes out well for Micron in any case, and Intel too, but of course Intel has a much more diluted percentage now in memory, at least financially diluted by Altera and MobilEye.I agree about your pricing ""lag"" model, good for the manufacturers, if less good for customers.I looked at the Intel link, it's very pretty but does not answer the real question, of how one calls flush so that the data stays consistent.  You can call flush today, or ten years ago, and go on asynchronously, and NVM changes that not at all, or at least the case has to be made of what is different and better with NVM available.  I suspect nothing whatsoever.  I did trip across some new note on this recently but it was such old news to me I didn't even retain it.Without NVM where does XPoint fit in the world?  Same place as NAND.  Perhaps Intel has discovered that XPoint can be built at virtually the same price as NAND, but with much better speed, density and durability.  That would be amazing enough.  Especially since officially, afaik, XPoint technology is still a mystery.",

"Muchogum, WT has written previous articles that detail MU valuation  and correlate it to DRAM pricing. What is spooking so many re MU is DRAM pricing which in the past has been a roller coaster.In this article WT makes a compelling case as to why the  DRAM players will be very nervous to increase capacity.Micron and Intel are both close to achieving Nirvana in the semiconductor world; a proprietary memory technology that can scale( no one else is close to scaling. Actually I don’t think anyone else is close to even producing anything more than interesting cell concepts).Regards MRAM, if anybody can do it Sammy can but scaling it will be a nightmare.WT, Bravo!",
"Very interesting Article William.I think it's pretty clear that there's been discussions of Micron buying out Intel's stack in Lehi, and this could signal the ECD lawsuit is nearing an end (maybe).Whether this means that there's a potential buyer of Micron or some revolutionary product release coming remains murky at best.A transfer of 100% ownership of Lehi to Micron would likely be more about getting their ducks in a row and avoiding future speculation that Micron and Intel could experience a similar falling out to WDC/Toshiba.Giving Micron control while entering into a new 3D XPoint supply agreement would be a smart move for both MU and INTC that will also benefit shareholders.",

"Superb stuff.  William.  Real money in the market is made by just such speculation.  You don't even need to be right -- just not too wrong,When yo say Micron has the first mover advantage, I assume you mean among the DRAM oligopoly.  Intel has the first mover advantage in sales with gobble of semi-captive data centers.  It's a marriage made in heaven.And at scale, which I believe Intel can deliver, as little as a 10% increase in productivity or a 10% decrease in cost is a huge competitive advantage.  Add flexibility to that equation as well.And let's not forget electricity.  The electricity to run the thing, yes, but more significantly the electricity to cool the thing enough for it to run right and not burn out (ouch).  Ever wonder why so many data centers are located in Virginia?  Sure it's a combination of favorable factors but low electric rates is certainly one of the significant ones.If half of Williams speculations are mostly correct this industry is going to change dramatically.",
"The author does not appear to have knowledge about the uses and benefits of 3D XP over DRAM. His speculations are borderline ridiculous. It is also amazing to view the cognitive biases that prevent individuals from understanding that 3D XP will kill the DRAM price bubble, if it doesn’t pop earlier, and that it cannot be managed around.",
"3D XP will severely harm DRAM demand in many data centers. There are many massive databases that are run on tremendously large banks of DRAM for performance benefits. Storage is way too slow, so companies have been paying up to run as much database in memory as they can. But the persistence of 3D XP allows it to replace storage for database logging while maintaining ACID properties. Thus the result will be a dramatic shift of demand from DRAM to 3D XP. That _will_ kill the DRAM price bubble. Micron isn’t seemingly so cheap for people in the know.",
DRAM prices bubble will end in a couple of years at most. No way to stop it. You can’t capacity manage your way around such changes. Would Kodak have been able to capacity manage film to save their profits from digital cameras? This is the peak fir Micron here with a good distance down in profits.,

"Ultimately non-volatile memory technologies like XPoint will succeed or fail on durability.  If they can't lick the durability problem they will remain niche products.

I may disagree on minor points from time to time, but not very often, and in your case, I think twice when I disagree.MU is now becoming a tech creator, not just a memory fab.  MoM and YoY financials (all backward looking) are just one factor in a highly complex business.  True tech companies invest  heavily in IP that, and in most cases, may not generate a profit for years.  The golden ring is that the right IP can pay huge dividends in the future.  The problem is estimating the value of the IP years from now, and not many can do that.I always look forward to your next post.",
"Thanks WT, this is exactly the info investors can make use of.  My concern is, can MU trust INTC (which owns the Lehi plant) to stick with the IM agreement, once the ""big bucks start rolling in?  Is this concern perhaps among the reasons for the consistent undervaluation of MU on WS?  I feel, MU would be well advised to start building its own 3DXP facilities, if only to keep INTC honest.  Another question/concern is whether MU owns all the patents underlying 3DXP free and clear, or could litigation raise its ugly head, once 3DXP turns into real money?  Finally, the competition never sleeps.  What are Samsung and Hynix doing to prepare for the new (3DXP) world?  If, as you say, MU is preparing for diminishing DRAM needs, Sam and Hy (together, producing nearly 10x more and lower spec DRAM than MU) must be busy devising ways for their own survival.",

"There are a lot of parallels between memory (DRAM/NAND) business today and HDD a few years ago.   For a period of time demand for HDDs were tied directly to PC sales and had become essentially a commodity.   First, the business rolled up into a duopoly (STX, WDC) which did two things:  1) limited new suppliers coming into the market and 2) decreased the amount of capital invested in new products (think process technology when it come to memory).   Why would a new outside competitor enter a market where the product (insert HDDs or DRAM here) is on its way to becoming obsolete?  Alternatively, why would one of the existing players over build capacity when they have a nice thing going?   At one time, the market thought HDDs were dead money and on their way out.   Data centers, the Cloud and industry consolidation changed the market's thinking about that.",

WTGreat article,
"Wt, I have concerns about the direction of xpoint. First, if you read between the lines of the Intel/mu breakup in NAND, I mean look how it was announced, it looks to me that there was a disagreement on direction right?  I didn't get the impression that it was a ""hey, we have this big xpoint party coming soon and NAND matters not anymore.""  Since it appears that Intel getting all the xpoint production right now, it really seems like Intel has a plan on using xpoint and mu kind of floundering on getting a product up to speed. This would make sense as this is still the same micron that took so painfully long to get up to speed in ssd business. Xpoint likely needs software/firmware/some kind of controller to make it work. This is the area that mu traditionally struggles and I suspect this continues. Mu doesn't really have a product for xpoint and Intel does. Intel has an integrated plan and better resources, mu does not. So they are together through 96 layer NAND right?  Then who knows how things pan out. 2 more shrinks on dram and then the dram players need something new. The commodity nature of dram has been good and bad. Makes more competitive environment but also meant wide, uniform adoption. Now there will be something new right?  What are the odds that mu is the one who comes up with that new thing? Samsung knows the change is coming, right?  They have smart people and more resources than mu. Why would we think mu going to win that race?  And customers will decide what gets adopted as well. I just don't think we have even the beginnings of enough information on how the future transitions will play out, but not sure mu is the well oiled machine to get the job done. But I hope they are good enough to be profitable and stay in the game. And on the good side, things look good for the next year or so I suspect. And anyone sitting on a pile of mu thinking this is a no brainer hold for the next 4-5 years is crazy. It may turn out that way but holding mu requires constant vigilance. Fortunately the core mu writers on this site make that a ton easier. Thanks to all. I think we are all very appreciative of both the articles and the comments that follow.",

"Enjoyed the Article, but the thought of APPL buying MU is not realistic based upon my experience as an APPL Shareholder. APPL is an “engineering” company and does not own any component makers of the parts it puts in the products APPL has constructed by other Fabrication Assemblers. At the end of the day, about the only thing APPL owns are storefronts and data service centers, and a few small manufacturing centers in U.S. for MAC computers. The biggest purchase of a company APPL has made was buying BEATS (Dr. DRE, Jimmy Iovine) for around 4-5 Billion Dollars. APPL would NEVER buy MU or any physical assets for 100 Billion Dollars or even 50 Billion Dollars (MU Market Cap). APPL might do a contract with MU to supply components, but APPL would “squeeze the Hell” out of MU’s profit margins and just make MU one of it’s whipping boys. In my humble opinion MU would be better off just to “keep on trucking” like it has been. MU will be reporting in March and Shareholders should see their holdings appreciate both before (in anticipation) and the day of the Report (to the tune of 4%) and in the days following the Report. Maybe this time MU can break $50 and hold that appreciation, however MU has proven to be a very volatile stock no matter what they say or do.

"Apple has a strong relationship for NAND capacity from Toshiba. Would they like their own steady supply without paying margins to Tosh? Certainly, it would give them what Samsung (SS) has, tremendous Flash Capacity (SS is #1 in Flash Capacity worldwide). That would also put Apple into a commodity hardware business, which is something they have never really focused on. There are certainly many suitors, but it would have to be US based as Micron is important to national security. Is Micron currently in play, I doubt it, they have a new CEO, and a solid market position to be independent as the only high volume, pure play memory maker in the US with its own Fab Capacity. I don't think Apple wants to acquire Micron, which would not be a small acquisition, and capital intensive as well, which is penalized by Wall St.  In fact most hardware companies, get taken out by other hardware giants, ala EMC by Dell, LSI by Broadcom, and so on.Everything aside from NVM (3D NAND and SCM) is quite mature.

"if dram would still lead on performance, why wouldn't 3dxp just insert itself as another memory layer for cost/performance efficiency instead of being a full replacement of dram? Can't imagine dram going to 0 based on that micron chart, perhaps 3dxp just takes over bitgrowth and dram remains stable. also, by 2030 we might have some serious quantum supremacy with a cloud computing interface. *shrug*",
"Now this fits with the thought that Apple will not buy MU. If they can get a long term favorable contract, they stay away from manufacture of memory and concentrate on the fields that they know. Plus, I can’t get my arms around why MU would sell if they are about to produce a game changing product with long tails. I’m betting no sale, but, buy back and dividend.",

Good news hiring of more sales people, and recently paying off more debt early, and no debt due for a couple of years. Sounds like a winner to me and they will generate Billions and Billions in excess cash and this is with lower sales or no sales growth. Extra cash can be used to pay off more debt early or fund the winners or buy some growth, and they will probably do a combination of all three. Bottom line is business is now stable and you either believe in the new management or you do not. I will watch closely as my money is very dear to me, but Papa and his team have not disappointed me, not even once, so my plan is to stay long at least until late 2019.

Both Moody's and S&P have recently issued new ratings, and overall they were rosy compared to your constant dire predictions.  To counter the ridiculous metric of 2-3x free cash flow you noted, here is a more realistic one from S&P:We could raise the ratings if debt to EBITDA moved closer to 5x, which we view as sustainable. Such a scenario would most likely occur if the company reduced debt further (through asset sales, conversion of its convertible notes, or additional debt exchanges), or oil prices strengthened further.

Let’s face it these guys are not Amazon and investors will not be as patient. For Expedia to spend so much money on advertising etc and yet have revenue slow down significantly is a discouraging sign.

Financial Services had previously guided for lower earnings in 2017, not higher.  They ended up making more money on the higher interest rates.  This is often true of banks and savings and loans and credit card outfits - they pass on the higher interest rates to the customers, and end up making more for themselves in usury.Meanwhile, much of Ford's Financial Services debt is in fixed rate 30-year notes, rather like a fixed rate mortgage, at very low rates.  Those won't change, and would only get renegotiated and refinanced if possible at lower rates as Ford's credit rating improves, not higher.Now if Ford Credit must take on additional commercial debt in order to support dealership inventories, and consumer and fleet sales, then that could originate at higher rates.

While Salesforce could be a potential acquirer, I do think CRM's disclosure of 1% ownership is irrelevant and doesn't 'tip the scale' on Salesforce acquiring Twilio. Also as Twilio builds out its Engagement Suite of Application on top of the developer APIs, they'll start overlapping with some of the functionality from Service and Marketing Cloud. This overlap plus the size of the deal makes it less likely. Cloud platform leaders such as AMZN, GOOG and MSFT have deeper pockets and more synergies with. In my opinion, they are more likely potential acquirers.",

So the “system” is buy just MU and LRCX?,
"Why don't you tell us what slippage you use, rather than annual cost of 1%? I assume you are doing monthly rebalancing (some months have 50% turnover), so with sensible slippage (especially for small companies) the performance would be much worse.What happens if you only use the 20 smallest companies? I imaging the performance would be much better (on paper). Trading costs of 0.5% would be closer to the mark, which would be much more than 1% per year.",
I see a lot are very close to the 20 price/FCF ..I own quite a few of these already..some are quite surprising. I think the retail stocks are the ones that have seen a BIG change since 1999 - not sure they will do as well going forward.  I think the one thing you can add next time is the sector strength. 80% of a stocks move is because of the sector.,

As far as we know BH might already sold or trim its stake in TEVA. It is very unlikely BH increased TEVA  stake after last earnings report.  Even in best case scenario according to GS TEVA price is $23 by the end of the year. I am not saying go-go short but I would not buy it as well at current price. I still think TEVA can hit $15 before next earning report. Obviously it depends on on a lot of variables but my opinion is stay away for a while but watch closely. I'd say TEVA is a weak hold if you already have it.,
"Facts only FactsJERUSALEM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 20, 2018-- Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) today announced the exclusive launch of two strengths of a generic version of Solodyn®1 (minocycline HCl) Extended Release Tablets, 65 and 115 mg, in the U.S.Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets are a tetracycline-class drug indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older.""The launch of these two strengths of our generic version of Solodyn® brings an effective, affordable treatment option to patients who are managing this condition, and marks our ninth generic medicine in the tetracycline category,""2 said Brendan O'Grady, Executive Vice President and Head of North America Commercial at Teva.With nearly 600 generic medicines available, Teva has the largest portfolio of FDA-approved generic products on the market and holds the leading position in first-to-file opportunities, with over 100 pending first-to-files in the U.S. Currently, one in seven generic prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. is filled with a Teva generic product.Solodyn® Extended Release Tablets, 65 and 115 mg, had annual sales of approximately $148 million in the U.S., according to IMS data as of December 2017.",
You do realize that Teva is likely to be acquired or made into a major partner at a much higher price...JPM and Amazon will be involved...i almost feel bad for what is about to happen to the shorts...Think of Green mountain coffee...,
"“Guys, I’m smarter than Warren Buffett” - Shock Exchange, 2/19/18",
Company will unload divisions and eventually turn around.,
"Don't get me wrong, I am not playing the short side for TEVA.  I had a pretty good move on some long positions from the low teens and exited at about the current price.  The Berkshire purchase does catch my interest, however it may be several years down the road before the ""ship"" is able to be turned. I don't believe Israel is going to allow TEVA to be purchased by Amazon or any other outside group.  I also don't see why the ""dynamic trio"" need TEVA?  I may re-enter a long position, but I'm thinking it will retrace a bit from the current levels . This is not going to be a sprint, but I think a long distance run.",
"Shock, You wrote, "" market chatter suggests Teva needs to restructure anywhere from $12 billion to $19 billion in principal payments over the next three years.""That is as false as me saying that ""market chatter suggests that TEVA will generate 20 billion in EBITDA next year"".   You don't have to make things up to bolster your argument, just let the facts stand as they are and then spin them however your choose but don't make stuff up. And, if you are consistent here, why does it matter if Central Bankers are just going to help them out regardless of their need for capital.  Now they have Uncle Warren to provide them support.   You also wrote, ""Mylan did not follow suit with price hikes.""  I have a feeling that you have followed this space long enough to know that MYL was hiking prices on their entire portfolio of generics from 2015 -2016, with the most prominent price hikes happening in 2016.  During that period MYL was in a very similar situation to TEVA today, and they responded in a way that looks similar to the way TEVA is responding today.  The reason for MYL not raising prices has a lot to do with when they 'took their medicine' which was back in 2016.  Now, MYL is over a year ahead of TEVA in it's restructuring efforts, so by comparing the two you are bringing to light the fact that what worked for MYL in 2016 might also work for TEVA in 2018.  Thanks for that reaffirmation.  Lastly you wrote, ""If large customers balk at price hikes or if Teva loses share to Mylan (or others) then its hike strategy could be an epic fail.""This is speculative at best or potentially you just not understanding how the contract pricing model works.  Their ability to raise prices will be dependent upon the supply they can offer, the breadth of product and the willingness for others to undercut their price.  TEVA is in a better position than almost any other drug maker to enforce some rational pricing on GPO buyers, and that is a fact.  They are still the low cost manufacturer of many generic drugs, but have yet to exert any real pricing matrix that makes financial sense for the company.  So your argument sounds like you are saying that Saudi Arabia as a marginal supplier of oil is going to try to raise prices in the oil space with their partners but most likely they will be unsuccessful because Russia will just take their market share.  It probably won't work that way and I think you know it.  TEVA will end up raising prices and discontinuing unprofitable drugs as a move to increase the bottom line, and that is something that the market believes because they have seen it work.",
A bold statement indeed!,
"I still predict that @SE will appear to be right on his bear thesis for TEVA for the short-term.It's more likely that TEVA is headed down in the short-term, than up, IMO, because they are in 25% job cut mode, which is best facilitated only if the CEO continues to tell us ""the sky is falling"".  It'll be hard for TEVA to rise in the wake of CEO continuing to delivery bearish news (on purpose).  For the next 3-9 months, there will be no *champion* for TEVA stock price, and bears will have their way with it.Plus the front #'s of TEVA just changed over today on key outlets -- it now shows EPS -$17.30, and PE -1.2.    (just last week these were showing at EPS -$7, and PE -3.5).   The new #'s will take their toll for 1-2 months.   It's like ""advertising"" which makes it's impact.I remain sidelined.",
Bozo will distribute ; Dimond will supply cash; Buffet and Tiva will supply generics to their new venture!,
"Aside from Berkshire's investment, TEVA's current valuation may be a little rich but doesn't present an unreasonable entry point point for money you don't mind sinking for 3-7 years. I may invest /speculate once the price regresses a bit from the hype.",
Buffet's time horizon is probably NOT a play thing or a trading thrill.  Try long term. Study what 'long' means to Warren Sr.,
"SE has been writing short articles on Teva for weeks if not months. I wonder what will happen first, covering the short position or stopping the short articles",
Warren isn't looking to make a quick buck. He's looking at management and what they will do for the long term prospects of the company compared to what he's paying now. If he was always worried about what the next quarterly earnings report was going to say before deciding to invest in a company then we would have never heard of Warren Buffett.,

@Fuji Investment Corporation I was just curious if your still holding BGFV,

Getting crushed after their earnings call.,
I don't think expansion is in the cards. They probably will continue with purchasing shares.,
"If they cut the divy, they have that much more room for growth or investment, and share price appreciation, so it's not entirely a bad thing.  The fact that the divy is so high tells me that management doesn't see significant growth opportunities, so they keep paying it out in divy so they don't pile up cash. If they cut it for investment that's one thing, if they cut it because of debt/ interest payments, that is quite another. As it stands, BGFV is not drowning in debt, so unless labor costs weigh in especially heavily, I don't think you will see a divy cut for awhile.  With so much money be paid in out divy instead of invested back or used for expansion, I don't expect to see a growth rate to warrant a high P/E ratio. alot of money this company is making is going right back into shareholders pockets instead of the stock price. As long as it remains sustainable, I think you have a good case for at least a regression toward P/B. This company doesn't carry alot of goodwill on the balance sheet either, since they've pretty much stayed clear of acquisitions. So the P/B may be of a higher quality than what you normally expect.",

Do the numbers add up? Think Mr. Market is really questioning KIM at this point.Own it and will not add more until I see a clear definite bottom. Do not see the point of adding more shares when the total interest rate scare is going full bore.",
"In at 22.55, UGHHH.......dripping for now.",
as long as Kimco can execute on there disposition strategy as well as their targeted 400 to 500 million dollars Redevelopment strategy it would appear that their fundamentals are getting stronger. all REITs have correlation to the 10-year treasury bond yield if it would advance even though the fundamentals are getting better Kimco would likely tread water. as long as I can pay the dividend long-term stocks should perform well. if the 10-year treasury stay roughly where they're at and there's no huge Market sell-off and Kimco can execute on their strategy stock should trade over $20 in the next two years. so the confidence got about 15% upside per year plus you earned 7% Plus on the dividend. total return should exceed 20%. if the fundamentals continue to improve and Market conditions dictate over fundamentals it may not meet my price Target but then you can just collect the dividend and reinvest it.,
"KIM's report was the 4th q final 2017 report, not the 1st q 2018 report, that comes out in May..I think there are going to be better buying opportunities in KIM and other reits this year.  Too many macro and company related headline risks out there.. the buyback is modest in relation to avg daily volume of 5.3m shares..don't see it having much impact in mitigating any declines.  let's see if they actually execute on it, they plan on it but have seen many reits say they will buyback and nadayou are getting a substantially higher return for a BBB+ rated equity than you would on a BBB+ rated bond or pfd.. well covered yield probably provides decent downside protection now that we know their plans for 2018 and 19..  so it could be flat to modestly down for a while, seems like more risks in bonds and pfds to me..let's see what Powell and other FED folks say over the next few weeks.

Reading all these posts with quite a few waiting for it to fall further I wonder if the company will do the same with the new announced buyback in place.  The quiet period will pass buy soon now that earnings are out.  Long KIM at this price and glad to have held on for the dividiend yield.,

"Hmmm.  Not much meat there dude.  There was this gem, ""If we break through this area of support, our next support would be ~$8.00. This is visible on the first chart.""  Then that chart should be shredded.",
"Long KIM, SKT & DDR.. Sold other REITs for profits before the down turn.. The pendulum always swings too far to the extreme and you have to take advantage of those swings sometimes..",
I’m pretty confident this earning season will prove to be the turn for REIT’s. Most at multi year lows and showing an extreme under valuation money will start to move back in and I think has started last week. I expect REIT’s to move on the upside very nicely Q1 and Q2 of 2018. I’m long DDR which imo has the biggest upside.,

An enjoyable read as always. IMO AGIO will continue to surprise people in how strong their pipeline is.  The potential to have multiple billion dollar revenue drives over the next 5-years should lead to this stock continuing its upward trend.  No doubt this is not for the faint of heart and should be looked at as a high risk high reward investment.  I love the long term potential and have been long the stock for quite some time.  Adding on major pullbacks and selling OTM calls when the stock tends to get ahead of itself.  With a market cap under $7 billion it wouldn't surprise me if this stock pushes $100+ within the next couple of years.  Just my two cents.Slow and steady!  Good luck to all!,

"Thanks for your commentary on OMER. I had a very small position before four world capital management short article. I added quite a bit after the pullback. OMER has a very appealing pipeline portfolio. Four world short thesis has some merit in Omridia reimbursement issue, but, lacked substance in pipeline valuation. For ex: four world considered revenue of 75k for IgA nephropathy with OMS721, whereas, it costs 750k with soliris? If a product is FDA approved with similar safety and efficacy, why would OMS721 charge only 75k (its all made up numbers by four world for their short thesis)...",

"My observation on this is that the company sells new shares to pay its very high yield dividend. So how does one ever get ahead in this stock from a total return perspective? it just makes no sense to me. They are able to incur new debt for capex because they do not reduce Equity by their dividends. Therefore, earnings provide a boost to equity that keeps leverage down despite increasing borrowings each year. What's in it in the long term?",
"I very much agree with PipelineDancer and srockaz. BPL is walking a very, very fine line as they try to digest their acquisition, manage their balance sheet, stay the course on capex and hold the line on distribution. Even if they execute perfectly, the external factors are out of their control. A few execution hiccups and/or a blip or two at the macro level and something will have to give. I think that fact is mirrored in price of their new financing...4%+ dilution and a price of $42.60! is a red flag. A planned and well executed one-time distribution cut that creates realistic breathing space over the next 2-3 years would seem to be in the best interests of all concerned, including unit holders.",
"Given the payout ratio, they had to fund the dividend somehow until they can get the unused assets earning income.I do not like dillution!  Especially at these prices!!-srockazLong BPL",
"It's crazy they are raising more money through unit sale this morning to fund a distribution they can't afford.   Isn't this what got them into trouble before?It's a good partnership, but if they keep down this path instead of taking their medicine now and going through a PAA or GEL or NS type cut and fix path, they are actually creating more risk for their long-term unit holders in the future.",
"Thanks for the article LP!In it you state:  ""The long-term plan is to increase the distribution coverage to market acceptable levels beginning sometime in 2019.""Do I interpret this as they are not covering their dividend/distribution for 12 to 24 months?  How will they pay it?  Will the re-leased assets be sufficient to get the coverage ratio above 1.0?  But the assets should be re-leased before 2019, right?I like a good turnaround opportunity, but 1 to 2 years is a long time for that payout ration to be underwater.-srockazLong BPL",
"rrb1981 knows this stuff. While I am not absolutely certain about a 30% distribution cut, I think there is a larger 50% likelihood of such to happen.They can’t really growing out of this either,it looks like the cost of capital this sector is permanently elevated, interest rates are rising, which certainly won’t help either. With an 7-8% blended cost of capital, it’s just not possible right now to grow and MLP much.In the future, most MLPs will need to retain a significant amount of their DCF. BPL is currently yielding 10%,so after an 40% cut, you have an 7% yielding MLP that retains 30% of their cash and can slowly grow via organic Capex, not a bad deal in my book.",
A better option to fund capex is to offer Preferred at 8 - 8.5% coupon instead of 10%+ yield on common plus debt at around 4%. It will keep Debt/Ebitda ratio within limit and increase coverage with increased DCF from new projects.,

"One thing that is very important that doesn’t get a lot of emphasis from SA authors is entry point.  Typically when a bullish article initiates and it reads as the possibility of a double and then commentary is mostly bullish with retailers ‘all in’ you can almost guarantee that the equity will fall so the fluff can get removed and the air can come out of the stock.  When the first article was published and the stock was pushing $6 it would be prudent to wait which I did and recommended.  While I didn’t catch the bottom, i entered at $4 and have the flexibility to average down.  I was able to exit the position on the next uptick towards $5 and then re entered too early again @ $3.5 but when my last call to IR yielded a change of tone, I exited with a muted loss.  Exiting and controlling the entry point has enabled flexibility amidst the chaos.  It limits losses and can provide rash decision making.  I can’t imagine shareholders that bought in a decent size at $6 originally being able to navigate this downturn by simply averaging down and cuttting losses, as it makes one wary in re entering after being stung.  Long story short, wait on buying when an article is published and sentiment is uber bullish.  Buy small first and increase size on the way down.  Trade the tops and bottoms along the way and take control of your own destiny.   Sure you could miss out and the stock could rocket and you miss out, but that rarely happens.  The tradeoffs favor a more measured and patient approach.   Good luck",

"For what it is worth now, this is Carlo's statement when Watson terminated partnership deal due to PFS CRL from FDA. This statement was issued on June 21, 2016.Dr. Dennis J. Carlo, President and CEO of Adamis, stated, “I believe that today our PFS represents a greater opportunity for the Company than it did when we entered into the agreement with Watson.  Although Watson has chosen to terminate the license agreement, I view this as a good opportunity to further explore the wide range of strategic options that we believe currently exist in this ever improving market.  While one might initially consider this to be a disappointment, it could very well end up being a positive development for the Company.  Recent published articles strongly suggest that there is a significant growing demand for an alternative to the high cost EpiPen.  Based on where we are in the regulatory process, we believe we could be the organization that fulfills that demand.  Many prescribers of the EpiPen have expressed the desire for a small, easy to use, intuitive, lower cost alternative.  We believe that our PFS product candidate, if ultimately approved, fulfills those needs and could help give a broader range of patients access to their much needed medicine.  Our plan is to meet with the FDA this quarter and we are still tracking to resubmit our updated NDA by the end of this year.”I would  like to highlight the following line from the PR above to show the inherent  con nature of this man.""I view this as a good opportunity to further explore the wide range of strategic options that we believe currently exist in this ever improving market.""",

The stock soared anticipating FDA approval to $8-$9, then sold off after failure. Curious why Allergen would not have been the primary player/partner upon FDA approval this go around? If Allergen would have serious interest in ADMP, why wouldn't other PHARMA companies of similar size and stature? Also, at the current stock price level, how can their not be a hostile take over attempt at some point sensing the pursuing company would be scooping up ADMP at a bargain price? Shareholders would likely applaud same, along with the ouster of the current management team.",
What happened to Adamis? I can answer in one sentence.,
"Many people here have expressed thought that ""dilution for self-launch is unlikely because so many insiders own ton of shares"".True that insiders own good number of shares however, people need to realize how this Adamis works.Carlo has great compensation package relative to his job performance and so do all his executives. He is not worried about shareholder dilution 'cause no matter what happens, his compensation will at least stay the same (if not go up). And they all getting those shares for free. Until they are able to sell of their shares, they are getting handsome compensation for destroying shareholder value. And they will continue to get that for years & years. Why do they need to care about their shares?",
Really difficult to maintain a large position in this stock with so many other stocks performing well. I have sold down my position from huge to small a long time ago. The amount of debt this company has is staggering. To have a good balance sheet in the future at this point would take many miracles. I will maintain a small position and maybe even add a little here with it being so low. But wisdom says you need to balance your portfolio with a lot of stocks. This one should be no more than 1 to 5% of your total portfolio imo.,

Moment of truth is coming very soon for Adamis.,

No way an approved generic epipen product just fades away into nothing because the company botches a deal. The market is too big for that to happen and there is political pressure for products like Symjepi to hit the market. Even if Carlo royally screws up the deal, there is value there, probably a lot more than where the market prices it now.",

"I'm a LT long and not too happy with recent performance. But I'm holding, and I'll make 3 comments on this. First, although Perceptive just filed their 13G yesterday, this is not new information. Per Forms 13F filed last year, they bought size on the offering in April, flipped most of their stock following approval, and closed the position in 3Q2017. Sio sold all his stock in 4Q2017. But given the year he's reported to have had, I'm surprised he's still in business. Second, a quick read of the Maxim report shows sloppy work. This analyst still has APC-1000, APC-2000, and APC-5000 revs in his model for 2019, when they haven't even filed the INDs yet. Moreover the company accelerated the APC-4000 and postponed the APC-5000 inhaler almost a year ago. It's not uncommon for analysts to ""wing it"" on out-year estimates, but at least earnings models should reflect the right products. Moreover he has modeled no revs for naloxone at all, which is likely to be approved before the inhalers. So his target imho is worthless.Final comment: I keep hearing the delay is due to Dr. Carlo's incompetence, and maybe it's true. I haven't met him. But if a single-product license deal had fallen through, they would have known it months ago and should have taken steps to self-market. So it seems more likely they are working on a bigger multi-drug deal including naloxone and perhaps others. Such a partnership is far more complex and would take much longer to finalize. It would also be MUCH better for the company, with larger upfront cash, milestone payments and multiple royalty streams upon commercialization.I still see a lot that can go right here, and I would note that the naloxone IND was filed months ahead of my expectations. IMHO yesterday's selloff mostly reflected weak holders who had hoped for a quick easy-money trade. I think the stock is a buy down here.",
"Your update was timely, and currently the only saving grace is that dilution and/or would certainly negatively impact insiders, as would a lack of a deal. Do we know name of the fund that sold heavily? Thanks again, John.",

Thank you for the update Mr. Engle... we appreciate your input !!,
"I enjoy your articles mr. Engle but I have to say I think your letting you emotions get the better of you here. The writing is on the wall, too much time past approval means no deal. Carlo will run this into the ground, and this is no longer a good investment. I think the best you can do is admit that the delay in fact does change the investment thesis.",

"It's funny how investor perceptions change.  As a long-term investor in ABBV (since when it was part of ABT and right after the spinoff), I remember very well how ABBV and CEO Gonzalez were mercilessly trashed on Seeking Alpha for over-reliance on HUMIRA (a situation they are still in, but breaking out of), the medical inferiority and commercial failure of VIEKIRA PAK (it's first generation HCV drug), the ""overpayment"" for Pharmacyclics (to obtain IMBRUVICA), and the fact that the dividend would be at risk.  However, Gonzalez insisted that they had sufficient patent protections for HUMIRA in the US through 2023 and that they didn't overpay for IMBRUVICA, but rather luckily and barely beat out JNJ in the bidding for Pharmacyclics (and JNJ, which commercializes JNJ overseas and share the profit in both the US and overseas with ABBV, obviously knew the value of IMBRUVICA).  ABBV also developed an apparently successful 2nd generation HCV drug (MAVYRET), and they are expanding/have expanded the depth of their blood cancer franchise (with VENCLEXTA) and immunology franchise (Risankizumab and Upadacitinib - latest positive results out over the last several days).  They also have promising near and intermediate term candidates (Elagolix and Rova-T).The stock treaded water in the 50s and 60s for FOUR years, until late summer/fall of 2017 (less than 6 months ago), when ABBV prevailed in protecting HUMIRA in the US through 2023.  Once ABBV gained the time to milk HUMIRA's US cash flow for an additional 6 years, the value of its promising results in other areas - success of IMBRUVICA, approvals of VENCLEXTA and MAVYRET, and clinical results for Elagolix, Risankizumab, and Upadacitinib -- could finally be realized in the stock price.My point is you can do all the dividend and FCF analysis you want, but ABBV was never a sure thing, and in retrospect, particularly after the failure of VIEKIRA PAK, management's strategy. determination and successful execution are obviously the reasons that we can all celebrate the share price appreciation and return of capital to shareholders. If you look at forward metrics based on reasonable forecasts for both cash flow and EPS (and over half of the 32% EPS growth guidance for 2018 results from operating performance - less than half from a lower tax rate), and if based on management's track record (and by now they should have earned investor trust) you accept their derisked LT forecasts for their drugs seriously (and they have put out LT derisked sales forecasts for all major drugs -- those approved and those to be approved), then if anything, ABBV is likely undervalued.",

The mood in South Africa is great at the moment. We have a new president who understands business and who has already put a good few corrupt officials behind bars. The rest are running for cover. The biggest problem with the share is its primary listing is on the South African stock market. It makes up 25% of the index. Local institutional funds are regulated with a 10% max in any one counter. So although their mouths are watering at current levels their hands are bound. I know this because is serve on the board of a sizable pension fund in SA.Until foreign buyers have their confidence restored in SA the Naspers share price will remain depressed. Crazy as it may seem a very small proportion of their earnings are in South African currency so this should not happen.However perception is perception and so I buy whenever I have spare cash because the discount will unwind at some point and Tencent is not going to stop powering ahead any time soon.For the patient investor you will be handsomely rewarded.,

For some weird reason AMD price always move like a sine wave.,
Thank you for this fine article. The GPU sales collapsing is an integral part of the analysis from these analysts but I'm very skeptical of this for the reasons mentioned in this article.,
Time to level up with Epyc:http://bit.ly/2C3GEW9,
"The cryptomining angle is valid. Mining ETN, MNR and whatever other existing new ""GPU and ASIC resistant"" cryptocurrencies might appear in the future likely will not make the miners lots of money, but it surely will make windfall profits for AMD. Making hundreds of dollars in profits on Threadripper CPU versus tens of dollars on GPU will make huge difference for AMD shareholders. I will not be surprised if AMD could even not be able to supply enough CPUs to cover demand as it can be explosive once every youngster figures out that he can mine some money between his games while his daddy covers the bills. My forecast is that we will have same shortages of Threadripper CPUs as we had with GPUs for last few years. The way to make money on the crypto craze is to buy AMD. I will very likely sell rather large amount of apr/may AMD puts and will add more of those on pull backs, can go up to 20% of my portfolio on this.",
"I don't do mining, but here is my question. What if the Threadripper PC runs CryptoNight along with several GPUs tied together which runs a separate mining program, wouldn't it produce better result overall and more cost effective?",
"Great article.  I am also long AMD, but was recently considering dumping my shares when they hit $13~ (I bought at $2.90 a few years back).  I believe your article has some good points that may get me to reconsider dumping my shares.  I'll look into this CPU mining, as I've been looking at GPU mining for a while now.You make an excellent point that a lot of folks may not understand, with GPU mining you are not dedicated to 1 coin, you can have algorithms that automatically switch to the most profitable coin.  As for CPU mining, the number of coins you can switch between might be less, but if it's still profitable within that space, miners will gobble these CPUs up in no time.  Also, considering that 1 Threadripper CPU takes up a lot less power than 6 GPU mining rig and this might be better suited for enthusiasts that don't have a warehouse with which to mine cryptocoins.The only thing that might slow this down is the fact that each CPU needs a motherboard, RAM, whereas for GPU mining they can buy a $40 CPU and $100 motherboard and still run 6 GPUs per ""rig"".  The solution to this would be new miners building new rigs can opt for a Threadripper CPU that can still run 6 GPUs, and basically use GPU and CPU mining together.Great article, you've given me a lot to think about, cheers!",

If AMD would be transparent and break out CPU & GPU sales an investor could better understand if AMD is making any inroads with Threadripper. Looking at the quarterly report I have to speculate that most of their revenue is coming from Crypto mining and low margin gaming machines. To me it looks like they are hiding poor CPU revenues.",
It is not nearly as efficient as gpu mining.  You are not including the overhead cost of the motherboard ram hdd...etc.  You can only run one threadripper per systems whereas you can run many GPUs on a single system.  This a limited opportunity for casual miners.  Serious miners would take a pass.  Hardly a boon for threadripper chips.,
"I remember reading about this possibility last year on reddit.  But I never heard of anyone trying it.  Says something that the guy whose article you cite for all this is also just speculating & apparently not trying it himself.  Do you have a source fom anyone ACTUALLY doing it?

How is this unique to AMD and not workable for NVDA or INTC?,
"I'm not sure if there is any upside for AMD in associating their Threadripper CPUs with cryptocurrency.

"The pivot away from checks was laid out 9-10 years ago. They have already stated they will be making larger acquisitions. They must be doing that because they see opportunities to grow cash flow at a higher rate than their cost of capital which has declined as the stock price has moved up. I'm all for pushing more aggressively into small biz services because there isn't much competition against their menu of services, maybe service against service, but not menu against menu.",
"I have owned DLX for about eight years from $18 to the present $72. Mr. Boyd, my approach toward this stock is different from yours. I view the company in two segments. Checks and non-checks. In checks, management has done a superlative job in driving down their cost curve at a faster rate than the declining revenue curve. They have done that by reducing costs and winning net new contracts from large customers. This is what investors missed when they priced the stock at 5-6 times earnings eight years ago and checks were 80% of their revenues. I am confident management will continue to do that. This means the checks part of the business will remain profitable and very predictable, this is a huge plus.The non-checks businesses are much less predictable. I have no problem with management buying a variety of businesses in the hope of being able to push products/services to their customers. They have 4 million small business customers, that's huge. They have a sales force in place. Making it all jell will take years. Given how software services are evolving, and the wide range of services, it is to their advantage to throw darts in the hope some will succeed because with 4 mill customers the payoff is ultimately enormous.The reason the stock is low is, as you allude, due to the perception of the imminent death of checks. But checks won't die in our lifetimes any more than bank branches died with ATMs.I put fair value of DLX stock at $100, even then I will not sell, it's my forever stock.",

"I strongly believe that a takeover of Commerzbank will find very strong objections in the German senior political circles. The government very much wants to retain one German Banking champion in the country. Deutsche Bank, being to investment, to international, less German retail focussed, is not the one. As to restructuring: that has been going on now for 25 years, More ore less investment bank and derivatives, more or less international footprint, more or less domestic middlestands banking and retail. Been there, seen it. After all, the current stock price is the result of a 10:1 reverse split of a stock that once traded at EUR 350! The less they will try to shift the pendulum in the future, the faster they will get on a steady course and be successful again.",
I still think that the most logical long term merger partner that Commerzbank should be aggressively  aiming for is Standard Chartered.  Commerzbank does not need in depth coverage to expand trade options for its current customers in Europe as much as it needs in depth coverage of many developing and frontier nations worldwide.It has 50 branches worldwide but most are single branch per country.  That is not in depth.   In the same manner the one single nation that clients of Standard Chartered worldwide need help in connecting with in Europe is Germany.  From that the EU and the rest of Europe would follow.,
Cerberus has a stake in both: Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank (in both cases a value play).DB is as sensitive to interest rates as Commerzbank.I do belive DB is the best turnaround opportunity in the European banking space at current price levels.

"I'm sure the % of revenue from outbound Amazon revenue is accurate, but the more important number is the % of revenue on shipments to Amazon. If Amazon were to enter the shipping business in-bound is the most likely as they would have a much more limited network. I see different growth rates on revenue for UPS 6.4% in 2018 versus 5.4% for FDX.UPS down 20% in one month versus 6% for FDX; I'm long UPS.",
"As with their entrance into health care, I think Amazon's entry into package delivery is a rash move fueled by overconfidence from their success in online retail sales and information technology.  And also with a naive & oversimplified view of the problems & complexities facing healthcare and package delivery services. (govt. regulation and legal liability being the biggest) Unless they cherry pick and greatly limit the services they plan to offer, I think they're in for a sad surprise.",
"The more Amazon delivers its own packages, the more profitable UPS, FDX, and USPS will be.  Amazon on the other hand will inherit the losses and headaches caused by low density and reduced packages per stop.  In addition, they will become a target for unionization created by the concentrated group of employees in the hub and surrounding areas.  I hope they do it before the next holiday season.  The Teamsters are waiting to organize them as we speak.",
"If Amazon puts in its own fleet to service its hub areas, what then?USPO is delivering Amazon boxes,,,TRUMP could change that.?",
"Long term I like them both, but the reason I've held UPS for a long time is the dividend and it's steady growth.  I want any investment I make to generate income for me.",
"FDX and UPS have the same ""forward PE.""  UPS generates a higher return on capital that FDX due in part to its higher market share.  For me, UPS is a hold.  There is a risk that they will over invest in capital.  But historically they have generated very good returns on capital.  WD",
"Not a bad suggestion Juan, I predicted Amazon would buy  the USPS business a year ago.  There’s the answer for Jeff, at least the delivery answer.  Employees, vehicles, facilities, experience, they have it all.  With the acquisition comes debt and major losses annually.  The fact is, that to deliver a package to a residential location in the same day, next day, whatever is being advertised, is costly.  It doesn’t matter if it’s USPS, UPS, FDX or Brand X Courier, density and commitment issues will burden any delivery company.  Increased volume two and three times normal is also a strain.  The daily dispatch of the packages has become the work of the customer.  How they call, when they call, when they want it, dictates the work schedule.  It ain’t an easy job anymore.",

Long Amazon through USPS,
Ups balance sheet sounds scary. Who let debt fly away like that? I don’t follow these guys closely but FedEx sounds like the better choice for the time being.,
"Here's some points to add to your thesis:1. UPS was in complete operational chaos during peak/Christmas season with the significant increase in their AMZN business. They underestimated the magnitude of the AMZN increase. I have known this company as an employee and shareholder over the years and have witnessed the deterioration of their commitment to customer service;2. A more likely scenario is that AMZN buys one of the two companies rather than a start-up business. Their were some rumors about the acquisition of XPO some time back, but an outright acquisition of either UPS or FDX is not out of the question;3. Look at the charts and you will see that UPS's stock price predictably falls every year around February 1 +/-. From a trading point of view I bought puts when it was trading in the mid 120s around Christmas and then sold them when it crashed. Then I bought long calls when it was trading at about 106 a few days ago.ES/Alabama",
"Bought UPS today,",
"Both great companies, currently UPS is more undervalued than FDX",
"Mr. Lodato,  Great message, and you are correct, these are two great organizations.  The fact that you are long FDX was obvious by the tone of your message.  I’m long both companies, but feel UPS is a better buy.  They both will grow without Amazon.  In my opinion, Amazon is bad revenue.  I know you think all revenue is good but not if it contaminates good revenue.  Delivering a pair of slippers to Aunt Mary living on farm road twenty minutes out of town is good for the post office, not UPS or FDX.  In many cases the movement of those slippers to a “last mile” courier doesn’t stop the effect that Amazon revenue has on total revenue.  Anyway, I applaud you for coming forward and hopefully educating your readers with the fact that Amazon has a long way to go in development of a delivery network and even if they did it wouldn’t hurt UPS or FDX.  By the way, UPS is United Parcel (not postal) Service.",
"Yanni....agree on many points.  Both great companies with lots of upside.  You should mention that UPS could unlock huge value by converting all shares to Class B.  In addition, their pension issues would vanish as many Class A shares are held by those plans.",

"The company has a lot of potential, but... why so many changes on the board just after Private Brands acquisition?- aug-2016 Dennis Riordan, ex-CFO, resigned after 10 years on the company (fair enough), now serving as ""Senior Advisor"" on THS- nov-2016 Christopher Silva, ex-COO/President, just switched to AdvancePierre... okay- oct-2017 Robert Aiken, COO/President, less than 6 months on the company! that's really suspicious!- oct-2017 Company looking for new CEO...Anyway, the future CEO will be key to accomplish the strategic 2020 plan.",
"Having listened to the 4th quarter earnings call, I believe THS is on the right track, it is just a question of how long it will take to accomplish something unique, building a single source multi-category private label supplier, and whether it is worth the effort.Treehouse 2020 is the company’s plans to address the issues brought on by their rapid growth and the current quarter’s report only serves to emphasize what a massive and challenging undertaking this really is.   Of the reported 1,100 customers they had after the Private Brands acquisition, they indicated that at most 100 are strategic, and of that 100, 34 account for 80% of current revenues and even a greater percent of profits, and this is where they are placing their focus. Besides opening up at least $1.2 billion of existing PL sales to other suppliers, most likely at higher prices, it’s hard to believe that competing suppliers will not aggressively pursue the strategic 100/34, given the wounded nature of THS, thus ensuring there will be little excess margins generated on these accounts for THS.THS touts their leadership in providing Clean Label and Better for You products in 26 of their 35 different categories, and that these PBFYNO products accounts for about 20% of sales and is an engine for growth. It is also the only class of product experiencing growth in 2017 with both OPP/Value and NBE, classes showing declines. This situation presents a couple of challenges: not only are these OPP/Value/NBE classes most of what they are currently (invested in and) capable of producing; but there will likely be smaller more nimble competitors in the PBFYNO space, putting continued pressure on THS’s volumes and pricing. THS management touts that they have moved toward “locking down the weekly production schedules” for like 44 out 48 plants, allowing their “plant managers to win”. It will likely be easier to produce to the engineered standards resident in SAP, if they can also adhere to the expected production runs/lot sizes etc. This of course implies that their strategic  customers have the ability and willingness to forecast their PL needs in line with THS’s expectations. If so fine, all THS has to do is meet the service standards they profess, recognizing that smart competitors will jump on any failures, emphasizing the value of their greater flexibility, and the minor cost of occasional order missteps, as opposed to potentially shorting customers whose product needs don’t make the weekly schedule .  As bright and successful as Sam Reed and the other founding executives of THS are, it seems the organization is realizing that producing PL products is different from the production of branded products. To me it’s encouraging that they appreciate and publicly acknowledge the value of the “tribal knowledge” that the Ralcorp personnel have brought to the group as part of the Private Brands acquisition. Production of PL products is not rocket science, I guess that is why there are so many PL manufacturers. It can however be very complex and requires a tremendous attention to detail and the cost drivers of each product line. This is part of the DNA of experienced PL manufacturers, and I suspect is a key part of the TMOS (Treehouse Management Operating System). As I have said before, implementing something like TMOS across multiple products, plants and customers is a massive undertaking. The very first item discussed in the presentation was the status of the CEO Search. The abrupt departure of the last President, after only four months, was shocking and the THS Board is clearly focused on filling this void. I personally thought that the new President/CEO might be announced by now, but it is reported the Board is still vetting candidates. I have not seen the position specification but I would not be surprised if the next President/CEO comes from the ranks of individuals who successfully grew and ultimately sold their businesses to THS. Other than the fact that they probably don’t need the money, or the aggravation of taking on such a massive undertaking, they have obviously succeeded in the PL space in the past. Alternatively, when the Private Brands business first came up for sale, I suggested that Berkshire Hathaway might be a good partner. Although my focus at the time was to relieve THS from the scrutiny of being a public company, the proven financial discipline brought by 3G Capital to their acquisitions might be helpful to THS.    THS is attempting to accomplish something which has never been attempted let alone accomplished before, even in Europe. I happen to agree that private label is the place to be, from a market standpoint. The only question is if their approach of a single source multi-category supplier is the best means of servicing the demand and if so whether there is sufficient additional time and money to complete the project.","TreeHouse Foods - Speculative Buyer, Even As 2018 Brings Another Challenge"

Product question.  Why don't they create a way for Merchants to build their own branded mobile app through the SHOP platform?  It's all mobile web today or it requires true custom dev for your own branded mobile app.  I'm guessing this is hard to do yet it's something that could be a big opp for SHOP if they can add this product capability for their merchants...........,
Who are the competitors of SHOP and how wide is SHOP's moat over them? Motley Fool Canada recommended them a couple years ago.....sure wishing I'd jumped in then. When the market decides to go into bear mode.....I think SHOP and other high flyer tech stocks are going to get taken to the wood shed (more so then others). JMO.,
The share price will be much higher than $200 and much sooner than 2-5 years. Shopify will be a lot like Amazon. It has the potential to be worth $1000/share in around 5-7 years.,
did the author suggest what the pricd would be in 10 years based upon the projected numbers? 9 billion sales 2.7 profit. assume much much slower growth. would that put it at 50-100 billion market cap?,

"I have owned 3 Enclaves with my 2014 being a beautiful, excellent vehicle absolutely the best of the two prior Enclave purchases. I am currently in the market to replace the 2014 and have driven the 2018 Traverse and 2018 Enclave . I am very disappointed in the Enclave . The seats in the Premier and Avenoir ( heated and cooled seats) have a structural member in the side seat bolsters that abuse your hips. These seats are ~ 3"" narrower than my 2014 seats and are very uncomfortable for me (6-3, 225 lbs) . Very poor design for a large luxury SUV and a deal breaker for me . The design of the dash ,particularly the heater controls which are at the bottom over the console with print so small one could hardly read and we could not determine if they were illuminated, is very poor . A big contrast to my 2014 controls which are all very easily read and positioned. Also GM eliminated the CD player which is a disappointment. The start -stop is tolerable but not desirable due to a slight hesitation and more complexity which will result in future costs. The trim levels of the Enclave dictated what you had to take with very few options on the Premier and Avenoir levels . I could not configure a Enclave at the Premier and Avenoir levels without AWD and a moonroof ,two costly features I do not want. Wheel options were restricted. The Enclave catalog was all about the Avenoir with little explanation on features and options unlike the Traverse catalog which had much more information and listed features and options with appropriate explanations . Buick could take a lesson on catalogs from Chevy marketing.   My dealer would not put together a deal any where close to my prior Enclave deals . Obviously GM is pushing up prices and margins .  After driving the Traverse ,it drove virtually the same as the Enclave  and had larger different designed seats which were comfortable and a more driver friendly dash and controls .  The Traverse had more interior color options ,trim levels and feature options than Buick . However wheel options were not acceptable . Also .the Chevy dealer was not dealing on the Traverse as well. Traverse has Stop-start and no CD player as well .INMO, GM has become less customer oriented with its product design features and options  . Consequently ,I am looking at other manufacturers of  SUVs or may drive my 2014 another year to see what is new in 2019. I am a very disappointed  in GMs apparent strategy . Although ,I may be in the minority seeing how the Enclave and Traverse appears to be selling. But this has been my recent experience and evaluation of the situation and vehicles",

Actually a pig is quite perfect with no lip stick in it's god given form and the lip stick metaphor has been used wrong here for over 50 years. Onto my point. These survivors have marked clearly with 'lip stick obvious' the time period you will have to accumulate which is between now and the date the bonds are due after being moved further down the timeline which is the expected recovery date. What better 'marking' could a long term investor possibly ask for? Be wise here and know your window to accumulate is extended and as clear as the natural beauty of the pig. IMHO,
"Every drilling operator and oil exploration company have been cutting costs big time over the last 4 years. They (Statoil/Shell/etc) believe they can cut even more - no wonder you get such inabilities to perform. Expect more of this to come. Every management pay lip services, saying that HSE is never compromised.  Yeah  sure...   You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.LR",
The top drive only takes about two days to swap out once it is out there and they have plenty of idle blow out preventers. The engine/generators have to be the problem you would have to cut a hole in the main deck to get them out on a semi-submersible. I can tell you that PMs are performed on a daily bases on these rigs. They maintain their equipment very well strange things happen though. I have seen a generator ripped off its mount destroying the generator and had to send engine in for repairs. I have also seen a piston blow out the side of an engine block and completely destroy the engine. Vibration has caused bolts to sheer on fuel lines and burn engine rooms. Let's just say somethings are not easy to detect until its to late.,
"Other than repeating what the announcement said, did you find out why the repair was not timely? Weather? Cost cutting aftermath?",
Similar loss of a 600k/day term contract event occurred with Petronas a few years ago. Transocean’s institutional memory is short.,
"I would be very careful to draw any conclusions from this event.  The author of this article may be correct that Transocean simply ""botched another one"" as he concludes.  But settling on a new day rate and adjusting a contract often takes into account many considerations.  For example Transocean may have a very good business relationship with the contractor and may have other rigs working with this company and doesn't want to impact negatively that relationship going forward.  Or maybe it is talking to this contractor for future work with different rigs?  in either of these cases it would be Penny wise and dollar foolish to go toe-to-toe with the contractor and far better to take a small hit now.  Additionally I doubt Transocean simply ignored the problem with this rig and didn't fix it on time  because of incompetence  The damage may have been greater then indicated which is very possible if it is working in an area like the North Sea.  The fact is right now oil exploration companies are still using any excuse they can get to get out of Legacy high-cost drilling contracts.  Sometimes, as in this case, they are successful.  Sometimes they are not.  What I think is more important for the direction of this stocks price going forward will be the commentary at the upcoming 1st qtr earnings conference call.  Rig has been one of the more bullish of the Drillers in calling a bottom and seeing green shoots.       So the author raises a good point that should be put to Rig's management at this call.  Namely if the North Sea harsh weather sector of the market has improved so much why not just market this rig for a higher day rate to an alternative contractor?  It's a fair question and one I will be looking to hear more about.  Finally I totally disagree with the author that Transocean's recent strategy to focus on the harsh environment and Deepwater segment of the market is a poor strategy or evidence of a lack of the strategy.  What got Transocean in a funk was its previous strategy up trying to be in every Market, in every sector, and every part of the world.  To their credit they got out of the jack-up market which is the most commodity like sector and oversupplied sector in the business.  You could argue about the future of Deepwater drilling versus shallow water and land Drilling but you have to admit that Rig is today a much leaner more focused company then the ""all things to all people"" company it was 10 years ago.  this combined with Management's actions over the last couple of years to strengthen the balance sheet and push out debt maturities gives me confidence in Rig's management.  For some reason this company seems to generate a lot of negativity, no matter what decisions they make.",

While I am not a RIG shareholder I disagree on the Deepwater status here and particularly North Sea given Statoil success and notes on break evens of 15/20 USD/barrel on greenfields.  RIG seems to also have good focus on the North Sea the first tightening in the OSD market and subsequent improvement in rig pricing.  The move with SONGA however was defensive in nature and not the best for existing share holders at the time.On a side note the latest notes from Goldman Sachs are now indicating the industry is catching on to the light oil condensate scam by shale drillers and the subsequent glut on condensate and shortage of conventional oil holding middle distillates.  EIA does not currently report what grades of shale are in inventory but GS has shown clues as to what's transpiring.  In short the chain of events lends to a high likelihood of a large spread occurring between the grades.  This natural supply/demand balance on condensate will by nature press down production of shale oil over time and self regulate it.  Refiners need middle distillates not blending components derived from tight oil.  I've put a link to that on the below from HFIR.  This is quite critical info to investors in the E&P space.http://bit.ly/2C2HClp,

"Funded capacity is definitely something to consider when evaluating the long term prospects of a Canadian LP, but licensed capacity is where the rubber meets the road.  As we have seen in Colorado, three or fours years into recreational legalization the price of marijuana starts to drop as massive scales begin to drive down prices.  LICENSED CAPACITY (as of February 16, 2018):Canopy: 20,650 KGOrganigram: 16,500 KG Aurora: 8,800 KGAphria: 9,000 KGMedReleaf: 12,600 KGOf course, all the big players will point to early 2019 as when they are anticipated to finish building their massive grow operations.  To believe that these dates are attainable, one would have to dismiss the thought of construction delays, permit delays, inspection delays or weather delays. Its not easy to build in the winter in Canada.  Even if they are able to overcome these obstacles, what we are left with is waiting for Health Canada to approve these facilities for licensed capacity.  It has taken Health Canada, on average, at least two months to license a facility that sends in their application and videos for expansion approval.  So, if all the big players are able to get their applications and videos into Health Canada by January 1,2019, that means that they will be licensed to grow by March 1,2019.  After the companies are licensed to grow, then they will start to plant their crops to harvest in 3-4 months.  So, we are looking at around June 15, 2019 before these big players are bringing in these massive quantities into the market.  Estimating that the recreational market is up and running on August 15, 2018, that means it will be 10 months before any of the large players are able to bring scale to the market.  Moreover, Organigram’s expansion plans are to increase to 25,000 KG by the end of May 2018.  With a 2-3 month wait time for Health Canada approval, in August of 2019 Organigram will become the largest licensed capacity producer in Canada.What does the first mover advantage bring to the table?  It makes sure that the provinces or private retailers that decide to sign Letters of Intent with Organigram will have sufficient supply to satiate the market.",
"Most of the production tallied by pundits is still ""planned"" or under construction. It only seems that there is a lot of production if you believe corporate plans will all come to pass, on time. Note that many companies give area of the facility but not how much of it will be used for cultivation or the area needed per kg of end-product (the companies can't really be sure until after the facility is in production for a while). In terms of product that will be available on day 1, there is not enough in currently proven harvest rotations to supply the expected amount of consumption, based upon the estimates of current black market sales, plus people who say they will try cannabis when it is legal. It is still a question whether the retail outlets are going to mark up the price so high that the cost to consumers, after the taxes, exceeds the price of black market supply. THAT will have a significant effect on demand (and therefore whether there is excess or insufficient supply).Price counts.",
Has anyone done any market analysis on projected consumption?  With almost all are massively increasing production is it possible that there may be overproduction and thus will require manufacturers to lower prices and take losses.  There is no track record so huge production goals are no more than a shot in the dark.,

"Thanks Gary, I agree with your analysis.  Here are some further thoughts:First and foremost, Arista posted another huge quarter, once again consistent and strong YOY growth, evidence they continue to dominant the data center across multiple verticals.  And what’s more interesting is that Arista has now posted strong growth in two consecutive quarters, while having to navigate the difficult re-certification testing as a result of the software workarounds forced upon them as they await final closure of Cisco’s 944 and 945 lawsuits.  Understand the implications here … these are Arista’s largest, most complex customers (ie. web titans) who tapped the brakes on spend to ensure the newly modified code still passed all the certification tests in the lab before going into production.  And like Q4, despite these headwinds, once again Arista posted 43% growth … but this time on the strength of the “Enterprise vertical”.   That’s hugely significant, as it represents Cisco’s formidable, once thought impenetrable domain where Arista is clearly making an impact.  Secondly understand Cisco is NOT winning against Arista’s flagship 7500R/7280R platform with EOS.  At least today, Cisco has no comparable product … certainly not the 5500, 6000 or even 9000 series, the latter using Broadcom ASICs.   Yes, Broadcom sells the same chipsets to everyone, but difference here is EOS, running across all ANET platforms … high-end 7500R, 7280, 7300, 7150, etc.  And Arista re-writes the drivers and micro-code on the ASICs, optimizing the performance even further.  Andy Bechtolsheim is both a luminary and genius.  (google him)So reasons to be optimistic:IMO this was a huge over-reaction, and I count others on the thread who sensed the same and jumped in.  (I added more as well)Arista has weathered the difficult re-certification testing for the final workarounds, and all of those completed in Q1.  As stated by the CEO on the call, expect to see the web titan vertical  once again produce the larger results going forward.Arista’s stage II of the rocket, namely routing continues to take off … the Arista 7500R and 7280R has become the gold standard for universal Leaf and Spine.  Watch this trend carefully.And its important to recognize Microsoft’s increased spending as a result of its huge success of Azure and Arista’s expansion into multiple use-cases.  This relationship continues to expand and grow, now representing 16% of Arista’s customer base.As I’ve stated several times since buying at IPO in ’15, Arista is truly a unique story.  I’m fortunate to have had a ringside seat and watch this little company with its dynamic engineering culture become a $2B run-rate company in just a couple of years.  More to come, I would stay patient with this short-term selloff.  Good luck everyone.",

Bert Hochfeld addressed that in an article of his. It may be locked... but you can surmise the answer by the little bit of the article you are allowed to see without a pro subscription:https://seekingalpha.c... To sum up: Arista is in the clear except for some minor adjustments or round-abouts to some software.,
How concerned should we be about how IP (intellectual property) issues play out with CSCO?,
"We have a former Cisco insider on here telling us that Cisco is treating customers like crap and helping the competition eat Cisco's lunch with their sneaky price increases and arrogance. He touches on how until last quarter they had 8 or 9 declining quarters in a row.  I'm going to ignore the experts at Barrons and go with the opinion of the former Cisco exec who hired the legendary Cisco CEO of many years John Chambers and knows the main players, products and strategies of Cisco and Arista. Just scroll up and read the opinion of Terry Eger. If you're too lazy to scroll up, here's the last of his comment:""Cisco is having an accounting generated turnaround and the stock market will love it. If other vendors like Arista execute and expand their focus they will do extremely will because Cisco is helping them. We will see.""People are seriously tired of being screwed by Cisco and Cisco keeps trying to screw their customers. They just can't help themselves.  It won't end well for Cisco.",
"Barrons says Cisco is beating ANET back with new products.http://bit.ly/2C46euqOur checks indicate that CSCO has significantly narrowed its price - performance gap with ANET and is improving its position in the 100G Data Center Switch market.CSCO’s NCS 5500 and 6000 platforms are based on Broadcom’s merchant switching ASICs and, we believe, offer comparable performance to ANET’s solutions, which are also based on Broadcom’s switching ASICs.",
"Hi, thanks for the article, I appreciate the point of view. First, I think ANET is a fabulous company. Its revenues were in hyper-growth mode up through the end of '17, and, for so long as this was true, the market kept rewarding the name with an ever-increasing multiple. I make no pretense at being some sort of tech expert generally, or re ANET in particular, but based on a cursory check at some other sites, 'consensus' seems to be projected earnings growth will moderate to ~30% in '18, 20% in '19. Still pretty good. But I am a believer in the notion the 'price follows earnings', and when a name is valued at a multiple that's north of 40, 'pretty good' earnings may not be enough. After the type of sell-off we saw in the name Friday, I wouldn't be surprised to see a bounce, but over the course of these months coming up, I look for ANET shares to continue finding a bottom as the market assesses going forward prospects.Just my opinion; could well be wrong. Best of luck to all.",
"Gary; What is the TAM of ANET????  How many shares do the top 3 insiders own and are they holding are continually selling???  I hate buying stocks like ANET because I have a long term philosophy that goes like this:  Momentum is a truly great thing on the way up but it can destroy you on the way down. And yes I know all about stop losses but the problem is so you put a 10% stop loss in and it gets filled only to see the stock turn right back around and resume an ""Upward Trajectory"".  So that is not always a good answer either.",
"I took a long position at 3:50 today, may be getting in with some downside still to come...analysts don't like companies who disappoint them so we may get some downgrades Tuesday, though the early comments are OK. My own feeling is that the weekend will bring some sense that there was panic selling and momentum traders trying to beat each other out of the stock. More important, longer term I think the story is still positive and the way this market moves, I saw an opportunity today that may not be there by Tuesday.",
We should distinguish between growth in revenue (which was in the 40s) and growth in EARNINGS (which was about 70% from the same quarter last year). We are paying for earnings. The earnings growth seems more impressive than the revenue growth.,
ANET is a great buy at around $250. I am very glad to add another 100 shares to my position at this price.,
I have been waiting a long time for this opportunity. In at 251 !,
This article is BS. The company itself guided for mid-twenties growth for the rest of the year starting in Q2.This article says the PEG is 0.6 because the growth rate is 40%.,
"It is a buy, but it hasn't fallen from grace. It just got a little ahead of itself. I think this is a good analogy:""It went from 0 to 70 very nicely last year, but in the last 2/3 weeks it went 70-100 ( too fast). It should pick itself up  next week. But the grace is certainly still there.",
"I can understand today's reaction as Q4 revenues did not meet overly aggressive traders expectation. Q1 guidance is actually fine as historically it is their weakest quarter due to seasonality and is flatline with Q4. ANET has best in breed products in the space and continues to invest in R&D to maintain product superiority. Management has consistently been conservative on its quarterly guidance. Beat and raise is the norm. Would expect ANET to slightly beat Q1 guidance going forward at $470 - $472M, a huge beat in earnings and 40% revenue growth in 2018. Opportunity to add as stock will continue to run higher after the panic selling and correction.",
I though the company is underestimated itself the cloud market is just begin. 100% growth y to y how can you tell this is the limit.,
Buy and hold,
"I rode ANET from about 110 to 265 a month ago. I'm just going to play the devil's advocate here. Microsoft is a customer but not Google or Amazon? Curious. I've seen Goldman Sachs conviction buys get halved in three months, like ABX a couple of years ago. I tried piggy backing Warren Buffet on buying Solomon Brothers about twenty five years ago and got hammered. There is no single source of buy or sell signals in the world that is worth following much less worth repeating. Sometimes if a whole bunch of analysts are changing their minds at the same time with sound reasoning you can use that as confirmation for your own research.",
Finally I might have chance to get ANET at discount after all these year selling PUT at $20-30 below trading price. Been making money selling PUT all those time. Sold March 16 PUT $270 when stock was around $300. Still 28 days to go. Look like panic selling that always lost.By day end panic selling would be gone. similar run out of seller like beginning of the month. Fundamental is same. PEG is better than Cisco.,
"Thanks for the article.My belief is that this selloff is overdone and an overreaction. Traders are obviously taking profits and trying to shake out smaller players to scoop up more stock at better entry points.I have seen this over and over with other hyper growth stocks only to watch them climb back to higher highs.I encourage everyone who has done their due diligence, who believes in this space and who believes in this stock's position in said space to hold on as I anticipate a quick recovery.I predict ANET closes between 270 and 300 in the next few trading sessions before continuing it's trend upward.",
It’s pulling back to levels not seen since....last Friday,
Am buying on this dip as the market opens. Good buying opportunity to load up on some more longs,
"Good article Gary. We use Aristarchus products where I work and our engineers are ecstatic over their performance, simplicity and reliability.I bought some ANET in September and am not at all worried about the pull back.",
Arista is a juggernaut. Can't believe folks are selling at 16% below yesterday's price. I don't see any substantial downside to ANET unless there's a recession or market crash.,

"Well,  sorl is down 22%. I would say that thier value hasn't been realized😂",
The writing was on the wall. SORL fraudulent financial statements are quite easy to detect if you just spent the time reading their Q10s.,
"Hi Christopher - Great to see someone write about SORL. I have owned this stock for close to a decade now and notwithstanding all the dirt that gets thrown its way, I have myself never been able to find anything fraudulent about the company. Sure, it's financial reporting is not as spotless as many US companies and there are some obvious issues with related party transactions - but all of these have always been fully disclosed by the company and at least to me, I have never had any reason to question the management's integrity. SORL, along with a handful of other small China stocks, gets clubbed under the broad ""China RTO fraud"" saga which came to the fore in full force in 2011. Since then, the vast majority of these companies have traded like they are all blatant frauds. While that has been true for many many many China small caps, I have personally found little reason to doubt SORL over the years. I see a business that has some terrific growth potential which has gotten totally clouded by fraud fears and also the complexity of the holding group structure. This is one of those groups of stocks which almost no one wants to touch even with a 10 foot pole. I have been patient for nearly a decade and hopefully my patience isn't going to run out any time soon. So we'll see what happens. The sky rocketing short interest in the stock is hardly surprising - because stocks like SORL have almost zero Wall Street coverage, it's not very difficult for shorts to make easy money off such stocks by accumulating a large short interest and following it up with a hit-piece on some forum like SA. The fraud fear around such stocks is so high that a single negative article can make the bottom fall out - at least, that's been my experience with similar such stocks since 2011. Therefore, owning and staying invested in an obscure company like SORL has been the ultimate test of a ""strong stomach"" for me. If you are interested to dig further, please look up the research of an analyst called Brian Grazenski at Greenridge Global. He has been following this stock consistently, quarter after quarter, since 2012. This is not just an unloved stock, this is your quintessential ""hated stock"" on steroids. It's the fear of the unknown, anxiety about the unknowable and the unmistakable fraud taint from dozens and dozens of SORL's China small cap brethren (who were rightly proven to be frauds). This is not a classic ""value"" stock by any stretch of imagination. I like the company, so am still invested in it and I see deep value. But equally, I am aware that I have no clue as to how or when the value may get unlocked. In the mean time, the mindless price volatility will probably not go away, especially now in light of the outsized short interest. The current short interest in SORL dwarfs the short interest levels reached in 2011 & 2012 when China small cap fraud fears were at their peak. Best wishes",
"I'm out of these small cap Chinese stocks. I have no confidence investing my money half a world away, where minority share holders have no voting rights,  you can't speak the language and they hate Americans. there's a very interesting article that can be found on seeking alpha if you dig for it, just search "" time to pump the brakes on sorl."" read and re read the article and think long and hard about investing in sorl. I've followed sorl since 2006 and made some nice returns here and there, mostly recently. these small Chinese stocks carry a very real risk of serious loss of capitol.",
"Oh boy, be careful with this chinese crap. Their accounting is definitely not US GAAP. Their quarterly financial statements are not audited. However, their annual report MUST be audited and that's when all the crap will hit the fan. Their Accounts Receivable are higher than their sales and growing as if they can't collect it, Their debt is growing as well. Their inventories are growing and they are not writing down to market old and obsolete inventory, their allowance for bad debt on their A/R is ridiculously low. Not to mention their Related Party Transactions seem very suspect. So be careful as some BIG adjustment are about to appear on their audited financials statements and all of a sudden their PE is not going to be what everyone thinks.",

Southwest paid more for fuel than any of it competitors at $1.92/gallon in 2017. Do you know of any reasons why?,
"Re Alaska the aircraft are not all 737s. Alaska has a big fleet of propeller aircraft that serve smaller markets and feed into the 737 destinations. In the Northwest the company has a near monopoly on traffic and prices reflect that. Alaska has bought Virgin and is building  a new terminal in Seattle to tie the airline together. Despite the near monopoly service is excellent and the planes are on time, making for cost efficiency. Southwest has succeeded with its one aircraft and no hubs strategy but I wonder what they would be today if they had emulated Alaska and dominated regional flying around the country. I can choose from numerous fights a day to get from Medford Oregon (in the south) to either Seattle or Portland. The flights are usually full and the prop aircraft are comfortable for an hour+ flight. Beats an 8 hour drive to Seattle.",

"Some of the data (information) is old or wrong. Delta's 747s are all gone and they have more planes and hubs that were mentioned. I have to wonder what else is wrong in the article. Love Delta and Southwest, just not sure about how correct everything above is.",
"Just a couple notes.Only in Southwest's world is size measured by enplaned passengers.  In every type of company, revenue is the defining metric.  By that measurement, LUV is the 4th largest US airline even in the US.In the airline industry, traffic is measured by revenue passenger miles.  Again, even just in the US domestic market, LUV is the 4th largest.It is never a badge of honor that a company has to work much harder to generate revenue than its peers.The DOT measures profitability in the US domestic market and based on that metric, DAL is the most profitable US airline and DAL and LUV on their domestic system have nearly identical net margins for the most recent DOT reporting periods.As for the Altman scores, there are several metrics that clearly favor low cost carriers and penalize legacy carriers and have to be rejected as an equitable measurement in an a diverse industry such as the airline industry.  Low cost carriers like LUV sell far fewer tickets in advance and so do not have near as large advance ticket liabilities.  It cannot be considered a liability that legacy carriers serve long-haul international markets that book months in advance when LUV doesn't even serve those markets which generate much higher average revenues.  In yet one more example, LUV has never had defined benefit pension plans while the legacy carriers have; the difference in the liabilities between legacy carriers and LUV is around pension benefits.  As long as legacy carriers can manage those liabilities and still deliver benefits to their shareholders, it is not likely that investors will consider those liabilities as real risks.The reason why LUV appears to be undervalued is because of metrics which most investors don't believe are accurate measurements in the airline industry.  LUV simply works harder to generate its revenue and has a more simple business plan as a result of being large a post-deregulation airline but that simplicity and extra work doesn't translate into margins that are much higher than other carriers.  Most investors look at metrics that put each of those factors in a perspective that matters to investors - which for most US companies heavily is based on current performance more than long-term advantages that don't translate into current period advantages. LUV does succeed because it manages to be very efficient and to keep its costs in line with its revenues better than most peersI own both DAL and LUV and keep the differences between the business models each have in perspective and understand how those models affect their financial reports.",

"""CRU's market analysis determined a significantly higher value from RNC's roasting approach over traditional smelting and refining.

""Dumont is expected to produce the highest-grade nickel (29%) and cobalt (1%) sulphide concentrate in the world2, providing maximum flexibility for potential partners and offtake parties from a wide range of nickel consuming sectors, including the battery and stainless steel markets."" The CRU study looked at toll-processing in Asia for a range of nickel concentrates with nickel content ranging from 14% to 29% through to a final ferronickel product. It found that net payabilities utilizing this approach for all concentrates were significantly higher than current market terms based on CRU's estimate of long-term nickel prices, product premiums, and tolling costs. For a 29% nickel concentrate, which is the grade expected to be produced from Dumont, the nickel payability for concentrate was estimated to be 94%, or 25% higher than the top end of the estimated current 70-75% market range for nickel sulphide concentrates.

"Thanks for the article Matt. A couple of significant risks you forgot to mention.1. The mine is located in Abitibi, and competition for workforce is difficult. There are big players already like Agnico Eagle who have been around for decades and still have trouble finding the workforce to maintain production. With the size of this project, RNC will have to play it aggressive to convey workers to work for them. This kind of project requires a lot of workers, with a lot of skills. That wont be an easy task2. The company still need a couple of approvals by the Gov of Quebec to mine in this area. The area present danger for water sources nearby ( Esker of Quebec). This could slow down the schedule and increase risk.3. The project is not feasible at all with the price of Nickel right now. Also the last study dates from 2013, with an outdated FX rate. If the company is serious why are they not updating the new study ?",

But for individuals stocks there is no bottom. Someone should be naive to be so certain regarding a specific stock and not use a stop order. People tend to forget. Go tell to the former stockholders of Lehmans brothers, washington mutual's,  Bear Stearns,… that stop orders are of no use.Even if you are well diversified there is no reason not to limit losses on a individual stock.",
"I don't use stops. Read a series of articles by a market maker back in the early 2000s that talked about how they would 'run the stops' - i.e., take out all the stops just below the actual real price before allowing the price to go back up.I also frequently see specific stocks open up (or dip sharply after the open) way down and then rebound. No fun!In general, I trade intermediate to long-term trend. If that isn't broken, no need to do anything. Recently, since I have been using more options, decided that I need to learn to react faster during dips - especially with near-dated options, which of course don't have much time to recover. But they are a limited part of my portfolio so minimal damage in any case.Cheers, Ian",
"last July / august I moved into two different sectors of the market. Energy and financials. I kept about 15% cash as watched as most of the financial stocks I was watching showed a lot of market interest, but seemed over priced with not much upside potential. I expected a January or February correction or I should say I hoped for one. I got in a little early on one stock on Monday and the rest on Wed. NCYB, HTBK, HBAN, and my risk stock UNIT. I am now fully invested. I feel we are in the last quarter of this stock market expansion and this year is going to have to ups and downs, but I don't see a crash just yet.",

"I don't use stops because of the possibility of a flash crash.  I know you watch the market carefully so it is ok for you.  But others don't watch the market everyday and may find out they were stopped out at some ridiculously low price someday.  Kevin Wilson noted that there are now about 500 TRILLION of derivatives floating out there versus 182 trillion in 2008.  There are probably a lot of companies swimming naked out there like Bear Stearns, Lehman, and AIG.  AIG was lucky to be among those who were bailed out.  The relatively small amount in VIX trading apparently was able to cause a lot of chaos.  Also with more Moms and Pops trading options with the Najarians' books and the helpful people at TD Ameritrade encouraging options trading, the problem could get worse.  It is tough to make money because you have to get the direction right, the time period right, and beat the spread.  It is probably better left to professionals with big staffs, a lot of experience, and powerful computer systems.  Using this bounce to take profits on stuff I bought lower as limit orders for stuff at low prices were executed, I must admit my huevos shrank a bit with the rapid drop and reduced the size of the trades, dang.

I appreciate seeing your sell logic as much as your buy logic,
Every time I have used a stop I have lost. Never used them again.,
"I totally avoid stop orders in either direction. My sole pre-determined trades are GTC buy/sell orders, which have worked out very well for me for over 45 years. They have reaped the benefits of dozens of panic-sell orders and frequency-algo overreach.The thing to do is to have a plan. I am now 10 % invested (to protect my profits from 2009-17), and most of these orders were filled during the recent correction. I have additional GTC orders in place all the way down to equivalent S&P 1100, and on an 'averaging down' basis. So if there is a far more severe crash (which I anticipate) my guesstimate is that I will be 100 % invested at a weighted average of around S&P 1500.If the market goes straight up from here, well, I will make some money on the GTC orders that were touched at the recent flash crash lows.The key to success is to avoid greed, especially in a climate where this particular (mis-)Administration is making enemies across the globe and expecting them to finance U.S. debt that has reached astronomical levels. A 3.5 % 10-Year Note is just a matter of time, even as growth slows. I foresee Stagflation that will burst the stock market bubble, even without a clear and severe recession.My advice: Have a plan, one that can withstand a 60-70 % market decline, and stick to it!",

IMO this debate about which company needs the other is pointless. The reality is that each has its own areas technical expertise and experience which the other lacks and by the merger both companies will get immediate access to technologies and resources that would have required years of R&D and billions of investment to develop on its own. Both companies' management agreed to the merger because they recognized the complimentary nature of their technologies and businesses and the monumental value it will create. NXPI shareholders who are willing to walk away from the deal over a few bucks fail to recognize the huge growth potential and value this merger will create and by using their proceeds from the merger to invest in the combined company and waiting a couple of years (while collecting a sizable dividend) their future profits will be immensely greater than anything price they get now.,
I think NXP will do much better if QCOM buys it. Contrary to what would happen to QCOM if AVGO gets it.,
"I've owned Qualcomm stock since 1997 and NXPI since 2014 and have done extremely well with both companies.  My personal preference would be for Qualcomm's acquisition of NXPI to fail and the companies remain as individual companies.  However, Qualcomm's acquisition of NXPI at a price higher than $110 is justified because Broadcom's current offer stipulated the offer is good provided Qualcomm's acquisition of NXPI fails or Qualcomm acquires NXPI at $110.  If Qualcomm pays a higher price for NXPI it may get rid of Broadcomm or force Broadcomm to offer a higher price for Qualcomm.",
"Although there are aspects of poker that resemble risk taking in stocks, the two activities differ markedly in time frame.  In poker, the outcome of a hand is almost immediate, whereas in investing (other than sheer gambling), the results generally accrue over several years.  As a value investor, I look for long term gains from stocks that may be undervalued (in the perception of other investors) for a variety of reasons.As for Qualcomm, it has by far the largest portfolio of patents that are widely used, or even essential for the entire wireless communications sector.  Broadcom lacks the breadth of patent coverage that only Qualcomm has.  Qualcomm has a balance sheet that is the envy of the technology sector, with relatively low debt and relatively high free cash flow and available cash for new R&D, stock repurchases, or acquisitions.  Broadcom has a balance sheet with relatively high debt levels at present, augmented by even higher debt and/or convertible preferred stock to be issued if the acquisition of Qualcomm goes through.  The common AVGO shares should represent a high risk, even for poker players.If you are a long term investor, look at the balance sheet before you commit to anything!",

"As to NXPI, their management is woefully unprepared for the changes the auto industry is going through as we speak. Qualcomm is already in most major carmakers business but could benefit from NXPI's sales channels. I suspect QCOM would convert NXPI to a fabless chipmaker with their relationships in the fab business which could make the company lean and mean. NXPI management is still recommending shareholders sell to QCOM under the existing agreement. I suspect with the amount of time that has passed, NXPI shareholders deserve another $5-$7/share. But I don't get this talk of $130/share - that's just not going to happen because Q will walk away.",

All true about OCA.,
"Why do you think that Sumitomo waived their right to develop and commercialize OCA in Japan and Korea? Why do you think the company finally released the 8-K at 5:26 pm on Friday ahead of a 3-day weekend? http://bit.ly/2C3mzPF I've heard that Sumitomo is a top company and Japan is #3 global market for pharmaceutical drugs? So it strikes me as VERY ODD...why would they just give away a huge opportunity like this in OCA? They're not stupid...Could it be that they think the Black Box WARNING is a big deal, and maybe because it's not a clean situation, it has a lot of hair on it? I know that Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to a SELL last week...I did not read the report, but I've been in the securities industry for a long time, and I think it's telling. Also, did you happen to listen to the commentary from the CEO yesterday at the Leerink conference? I did and I was really surprised at the lack of well thought questions....it struck me as weird, like the CEO and the analyst were in cahoots. The CEO commented that they were really happy with the label change, he never mentioned the words Black Box Warning...also, instead of saying deaths, he said that the patients progressed thru the normal disease process. Having spent 35 yrs on Wall St, I know exactly why they released the 8-K on Friday night, it's because that's what companies do when they are trying to hide information because most people will miss it. The timing is intentional, not coincidental. I find it to be somewhat of a contradiction to the glowing candy-coated presentation he laid out yesterday at Leerink, and curious how the Leerink analyst didn't ask about it yesterday...I knew it was out there, I warned people and took a lot of heat from them, they just thought I was a person who was short the stock and trying to knock it lower.

"i dont believe that OCALIVA could become a first line treatment in NASH for several reasonsif one excludes the safety problem for cirrhotic patients revealed on PbC patients’ the main reasons are the LDL increase induced by OCA that could not be completely balanced with statins despite ICPT assertions the second reason is the important prurit induced by the drug that will jeopardize patient’s compliance to the treatment’ mainly for patients with no clinical effects of their disease ( F2 and F3) as soon another treatment with lower adverse effects will reach the market, OCA will loose a big part of its patients to complete, OCA never reached a NASH resolution endpoint in the previous trials’ so mentionning it as a potential first line treatment is a bit presomptuous",

Probably The short period ended yesterday.,
scripts were best they've been in 2 months but the shorts still own this stock. could easily see 1.50 before they decide to move on to other ideas. also this stock is dead $ at least until the Q4 call,
The scripts are clearly going nowhere. It's absolutely pathetic. The weekly chart is often posted on stocktwits. I do wonder whether Jacob is in bed with a short hedge fund. Troy is very disappointing. He hasn't done anything to instill confidence in the company. The fact that Jacob is still on the BOD is a travesty. I would guess fair value of a BO is $3. What a joke it all is.,
Where can I go to track the scripts?,
"No, I don't think it's all about the scripts, although seeing them increase is a positive.  Everyone knows that this company does not have the resources of a larger one.  A company with deep pockets will ultimately unlock the underlying potential of Trulance.  So I don't feel everything is riding on weekly script numbers.",

how will the lawsuit effect the stock price ?,
"For those that looked for a quick profit in the pharma world should stick to something you know. This is a volatile industry and only for investors that are in it for the long haul. Managed care, govt overhaul, and numbers driven healthcare are in continued flux. The days of 2,5 and 10 year plans are not applicable in today’s environment. Good products will win in the end. But a bumpy ride is to be expected.",
"Thanks for a very cautious analysis. I think the most important item was the international market in particular Asian market, where the demand can be massive, although the profit will be smaller. With that in mind, the international market will generate revenue much greater than US market. The CEO did not mention the progress in getting the European approval, which is a major market. Finally, more established Trulancence will offer better conditions for the BUYOUT possibilities. I am sure that potential suitors are watching the market success of the Trulance before bidding war to start.Mr. Jacob is a piece of art, he does not belong in the company in any position, he should be shown the door as soon as possible, even his shadow is scary. I am long on the stock.",
"The recent tendency to brand information which contradicts your own views as ""fake"" is lamentable.  If you have information indicating that Trulance sales are more robust than the  Bloomberg and IMS numbers would indicate, I'm sure management would be glad to disseminate it.  I note that, according to IMS, Trulance  weekly pill count peaked at 104,664 in the week ending Dec. 15.  Since then it has drifted steadily downward, falling to 87,936 during the most recently reported week.  I would particularly note the persistent weakness in refill prescriptions.",

Dead money until sale of ex-US rights and DTC marketing begins... Assuming they can afford it.Good summary.,
"Yes, there is often a falloff in script counts in the opening months of the year ... but this is characteristic of established drugs where people will delay refilling prescriptions until after their deductible is met.  A great many of the Trulance scripts are new scripts filled with coupons where this should not be a factor.  Moreover, this is supposed to be a NEW and SUPERIOR drug for an unmet need.  The introduction is now almost a year old and, at a point where Linzess was generating an average of 8,000 NEW scripts per week, Trulance is struggling to generate around 2,400 TOTAL scripts per week.  I would suggest that there is a subset of patients for whom neither Linzess nor Amitiza work very well; unfortunately, these are the most intractable cases and Trulance doesn't work very well for them either. The weakness of the refill numbers speaks volumes.",
"Another way to look at the script counts is that there was a surge in TRX's in December that fell off in January and is slowly building back up in February.  This could be filling of prescriptions before new deductibles start in January.  Is this a pattern seen with other drugs?  At any rate, SGYP needs a bump in prescription growth for the stock price to move.",
"Without further comment, I will just note that in the 49'th week after launch, script counts are actually LOWER than they were during the 35'th week.  In fact, over the past 8 weeks, script counts have DROPPED an average of 48 scripts per week.  The sales force, despite their limitations, are generating some trial.  However, the trial is not translating into refills.  Troy mentioned that they have, to this point, 9,644 unique prescribers.  The numbers suggest that each of these prescribers is writing an average of 1/2 a prescription (NRx) per month.",
"Very good article, thank you. Long SGYP.",
"The company is familiar to a lot of hedge funds.  Any change in perception could be very good for the shares.  After hedge funds like Paulson (which had 24 million shares) blew out somewhere around 15-20% of the company in Q4 2017, hedge fund ownership is dramatically lower now.  It would be great if SGYP could get the interest of an activist hedge fund that might agitate for a sale or major partnership.",

SGYP as the company generates its own chaos. Chaos keeps simpletons busy playing ""business"".

Synergy management can not be trusted. Fool me once...,
yazzbro couldn't have said it better myself..partner or sell and move on.. management is either corrupt or incompetent..if not both,
"I understand the skepticism given what's transpired over the last several months, re: dilution and script growth.  However, two things stood out for me in yesterday's presentation.  There is an increasing number of scripts written for 90 days, now a total of 15% of TRX.  So prescribers are getting increasingly comfortable with Trulance.  In addition, 50% of patients using Trulance are new to Rx medication.  This market is still nascent and a long way from being mature.  The vast majority, about 95% of those suffering symptoms are still taking OTC remedies.  So it is encouraging to see patients new to Rx meds using Trulance as a first option.  The question I have is:  what is the strategy to ""educate and activate"" the ""Rx ready patient"".  It sounds like they want to piggyback on what their competitors are doing.  I don't think that's good enough.  Of course, this raises the issue of whether they have the cash resources to go it alone.  I think we are all agreed that this is not the case.  I still think we are primed for a buyout in 3-6 months.  Given the vast untapped market, this company is very attractive to a much larger one.  And only a much larger company will unlock the potential value of Trulance.  We shall see soon enough when a buyout materializes.",
"Scripts didn't look so hot this week..Looks like they are going in the wrong direction. So far we hear how great Trulance is and how it ""should"" be ripping past Linzess in the very near future.. And I agree...Trulance is the superior drug...BUT, Linzess has the Superior Big Biotech with deep deep pockets backing it...Making the battle for Trulance to over take Linzess a very difficult one. Not sure SGYP management is going to be the group to guide Trulance to the promised land.  SGYP management is amateur at best.. I am glad they have a new CEO but, as you wrote in the article, he doesn't have CEO experience..but ok, let's give him a chance.. But it really does really feel like at this point, like they have the fastest quarter horse in the world and a rookie jockey riding it. It just doesn't make a lot of sense.  But it's early in the game and we will see what happens.  I think what we can ALL agree on is that Trulance would be much better off in stronger hands.  If I were management I would be calling every big biotech that has a GI presence and try to get a buyout deal or at the very least a partnership deal done ASAP.  As noble as it is for SGYP to try and go this alone...I just don't think they have the money or the management team to accomplish going it alone successfully.  Maybe management is trying to sell or partner up and they are acting like they are going to go it alone for leverage sake.  But, right now it looks a lot like they are going it alone and if that is the route they actually take we are looking at more dilution down the line at some point and long turbulent road in front of them.  They need to just sell the company and move on. I just don't think this management team is capable enough to take significant market share from Linzess.  I hope I am dead wrong here.. But, just sell the company Gary and move on.",
"So taking a 70% loss was the best thing you had done in 2017?  Hope you have better luck with your investment in 2018.  Sounds like most longs here willing to give the new CEO at least 6 month before decision regarding their holding, while those already out or shorts wishing to see it down to zero.  I believe longs may have over 50% of chance to see a pop in six months, if not earlier.  Expectations are so low, any somewhat positive news will pop the share price.

I also realize that real change takes time, but I wonder what is being done internally to raise the competence and level of the management team and especially the board.  Without internal change, I question the amount of progress that will be realized in 2018 or beyond. I invested in the company because I believed in the product and the benefit it brings to patients. The FDA has validated our beliefs in the product. Unfortunately investors have and continue to suffer.  And one ppt presentation does not constitute a cure. I realize that Mr. Hamilton is in the early days of his tenure and his days are completely filled.  But I respectfully request frequent communications describing the company’s progress. We need to see real progress other than a quarterly update that conforms to SEC and FASB standards and does not warm the hearts of those who believed. Thank youHoward.",

It's always good to see a positive article that points out the fact that they have no competition for Azedra. What company in the world wouldn't want a product with no competition. It definitely has a small patient base but so does SRPT (take a look at their market cap). I am very surprised that they have not been a target for BO with the pipeline that they have. The one thing I would caution is that they have a $50M payment due to the previous owners of Azedra upon approval so they will dilute but if you get in at these prices you can't go wrong.,

"What I miss in the article, and what I think is understated in general is the solid performance of Bath & Body Works. Investors tend to focus on the performance at Victoria's Secret stores, although this is understandable and important it comprises 47% of the business from a revenue point of view.A quick glance at the Q3 2017 10-Q shows operating margins for B&BW exceed those of Victoria’s Secret. Year to date 2017 sales for Victoria’s Secret in Q3 are $4718m with an operating income of $476m (10% operating margin), while B&BW has $2354m of sales with an operating income of $396 (16.8% operating margin). In Q3 B&BW operating margin dollars even exceeded those of VS.Looking at Q4 revenue B&BW in-store sales grew 5% adjusted for the extra reporting week and online sales grew over 20%. The growth at B&BW will significantly contribute to the bottom line. I do not expect this growth to stop with the remodeling of the stores in White Barn shop in shops. I am not saying I like the declines at Victoria’s Secret but I rather like to point out the fact that investors should focus on the entire business. I am looking forward the Q4 quarterly report to see how both VS and B&BW performed on a operating margin basis. I expect to company to report strong numbers for B&BW which will be a solid base for 2018 and this will be reflected in 2018 EPS guidance.",

"Very light examination of L Brands market fundamentals, competition, and as other 'analysts' say - headwinds. All I can offer is anecdotal evidence for ignoring this company. Sure dividend yield is great now - and negative equity is also large. But still the dividend is covered because??? Because the economy appears robust now. Our Bankrupter-in-Chief has run the Trump empire the same way, borrow to fund today's operations while counting on future growth paying the commitments down the road. And then Whoops!Currently the damage of hedging our countries future by taking the negative equity larger isn't apparently hurting our system. But no new year over year revenue growth is apparent either. Now that I have inflamed the politically minded investors/speculators - how do we look at an entities' balance sheet to determine their forward thinking proactive plan for revenue development? We look at how they are applying their capital. Are they buying new lines or diversifying their business model and grabbing useful segments of their market or of synergistic market share(s)? No, instead they closed out their swimsuit and apparel lines? Add to the drop in mall traffic and the millennial digital presence, what is Victoria Secret or L Brands doing to focus on the ""Amazon"" market (as it were). Didn't notice any comment showing hints of developing future growth. Oh - but the peer competition is also facing the falling margins as Victoria Secret. And the backward looking last 5 years have shown an amazing ability to manage tight margins and manage the tight marketplace with less foot traffic. The high level of debt with current operating margins is apparently good reason for this market segment and this company to have a depressed share price. So the free market is working....but the shareholder has been rewarded during this downturn in L Brands' fundamentals by an increasing dividend. IS THIS A GOOD THING? For dividend hunters, maybe. For legacy stockholders, I hope it is.More importantly from a long term dividend investment mindset - is this company going to keep paying decent dividend levels for the next 5,10,30 years? If you are dividend growth investor hoping to retire comfortably on your investment income, will L Brands provide immediate dividend return only to become a value trap in the next 10 years? Just from this well written and nicely graphed out article, I see a CEO & Board bucking headwinds by raising dividends while borrowing money. Keeping dividends flat might have caused a further decrease in share price, but continuing on this path makes me RUN from such an 'investment'. This is moving into speculation territory when the business dynamics are so ""iffy"". No, spend more, make less, population moving to digital purchasing - no mention of any digital toe-hold to insure continued younger-aged market growth. They do have productive digital marketplace, but I'm not even bothering to look at their sales figures. After all anyone investing should do their own Due DILIGENCE!And I hate to add anecdotal now, but when I head to VS for a surprise, I frequently find older women and a few creepy older men (like me) picking up items that won't fit the Gisele Bunchen models on their yearly shows. I'm not seeing the youngsters who's fascination with life and new found exuberance of libido (that may drive future sales) in the store shopping. And I'm not speculating about the young salesforce...I'm sure they are all good Christian girls who are way younger than my sons.Not saying this is a dead horse, but I am saying I would only hold this as a continued historical investment; the BoD & CEO are rewarding current investors who's basis might be much lower and who may have already reaped their investment and then some...but for me, as a new position? I see good dividend vs. value trap vs. beaten down phoenix stock ready to rebirth vs. a dying turkey stock not yet ready for plucking. I'll consider the dividend and phoenix approach, but I'll call that speculation. The value trap & turkey stock analogy - I consider those throwing money away...Thanks but no thanks.",

"""That Pera is highly intelligent and capable is without question.""  As an engineer, perhaps.  As a CEO and manager, it's pretty obvious this is not the case.  In fact, in those departments, he's shown himself to be below average, struggling, and costing the company and shareholders.  He ought to take a lesson from Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who despite their own brilliance, had the good sense to hire an experienced, top-quality CEO to run Google for them until they acquired the knowledge and skill necessary to take over themselves.  Steve Jobs was a pretty bright guy too, but a pretty poor CEO and manager through his first 15+ years.  When did he begin enjoying great success?  When he finally hired a top-quality management team to run the machinery - CFO Fred Anderson (ADP), COO Tim Cook (IBM/Compaq), and VP Retail Ops Ron Johnson (Target).  No excuse for Pera not to figure this out by now.  Jeff Bezos he is not.Incidentally, the capricious camera initiative had nothing to do with Ubiquiti, its corporate charter, vision, mission, or product lineup.  It was a personal vanity project and flight of fancy.  A guy with more experience and a decent set of ethics would have recognized it as such, and instead of using Ubiquiti to indulge himself, would have set it up in a separate company.Last, there is a fair amount of clueless speculating on the SEC.  If you don't know, why express an opinion?  Go find an attorney or two and ask whether SEC attorneys tend to be top 1/4 of the class or bottom 1/4 of the class types?  Ditto for the CPAs in the financial crimes unit.  Then go find someone who actually works at the SEC or interacted with the SEC professionally.  The idea that the SEC is taking this action because of some sort of influence from Andrew Left is somewhere between tinfoil hat convention worthy and laugh-out-loud childish ignorance.  Doesn't mean there's fraud.  Doesn't mean there's not.  Just means there is material information consistent with potential fraud that the SEC is obliged to investigate under its internal policies and procedures.  If there's no fraud there, why all the emotional ranting?  It's investing, not some sort of religious crusade.",

"I bought and installed some Ubiquiti equipment in my house.  After I did this, I threw away all the other consumer-grade equipment I had bought, some of it quite recently.   Ubiquiti products are on another level for a variety of reasons:  They can handle more than 100 Mbps, which consumer-grade ""gigabit"" equipment cannot.  They allow you to have several access points with one SSID, and clients can just roam around your house without connecting to different SSIDs.  And they have managment software, allowing you to see exactly what is going on with all the networking equipment, and upgrade it remotely and easily.   It is way beyond what anyone else offers.The situation is similar to what Tesla has done.  A Tesla car, with its performance, lack of emissions, and self-driving features,  makes existing offerings from other companies seem ossified and irrelevant.  Having experienced it,  existing customers would buy the same car again.The author might not have domain expertise, but his reasoning and conclusions are correct.",
"Ubiquiti: community cares - Financial Times""The networking hardware company might be better off private...""Link: http://on.ft.com/2BG2o9H",
"I posted this on Motley Fool and StockTwits yesterday so some of you have already seen this:Here’s the 8K filing that led to today’s selloff:On February 13, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) issued subpoenas to Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (the “Company”) and certain of the Company’s officers requesting documents and information relating to a range of topics, including metrics relating to the Ubiquiti Community, accounting practices, financial information, auditors, international trade practices, and relationships with distributors and various other third parties. The Company is in the process of responding to the requests and intends to cooperate fully with the SEC. This does sound similar to some of Left’s claims, so maybe the SEC is now getting around to investigating. It does seem somewhat far-fetched to believe that the SEC would be influenced by Citron, but it is difficult to know what is causing this with more information. Here is Bert’s reaction via a comment from his latest article:This is no more and no less than an attempt by Left and his thugs to protect their short position. These are the same tired and false accusations that he and his cohorts made last fall. They were gross misrepresentations then and they still are. Just follow the cash. The company generated lots of it last quarter. And look at the community board and see how it works in terms of numbers. It is sad that this is the way the game is played these days and their is no sanction for getting the SEC to play the part of the heavy.Although, UBNT has denied Left’s claims, they later did admit on 11/9 that the user community numbers from their investor presentation was misstated. See below from the 8K filing from that date:As a result of a reporting error, the previously furnished Prior Investor Presentations and the investor presentation used by Company management dated as of May 2017 referenced 4 million registered users in the Ubiquiti Community, and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 reported that the Ubiquiti Community included over 4 million entrepreneurial operators and systems integrators. In actuality, as of December 31, 2016, the Ubiquiti Community included approximately 609,000 registered users, while there were approximately 4 million registered user sessions at http://bit.ly/1M0Xbbl during the calendar year ended December 31, 2016. The information on http://bit.ly/1M0Xbbl is not part of this Current Report on Form 8-K. This to me would appear to be more a result of the lack of G&A spend than an outright attempt to deceive investors. If your corporate operations are minimal, mistakes like this can sometimes get through. I am OK with this risk as long as there is a focus on making sure the financial reporting controls are decent.The concern over accounting practices is unusual given the lack of complexity of their balance sheet. I have posted before how simple their balance sheet would be to audit and gain comfort over the balances. Note that from an audit standpoint, only the Q4 balances (June 30 year-end) would be audited in detail and for quarterly releases, KPMG would perform higher level procedures like flux analyses and review of critical items (major new contracts, accounting policy changes, etc). With that said, let’s go through the balance sheet:Cash – $824M (71% of total assets) – From my 9/30 post “Cash is one of the easiest things to audit with the main test being an independent confirmation being sent out by KPMG directly to the bank. The bank would then complete the confirmation with the cash balance and send it back directly to KPMG. Given the direct confirmation, there is not much opportunity for the company to interfere if they were trying to fake a cash balance. In addition, given the high balance, KPMG, would likely test multiple controls around cash from a SOX perspective. The main control would be the reconciliation of the cash on the balance sheet to the bank statement. A UBNT accountant would need to perform the reconciliation and a separate supervisor would need to review it. There are likely multiple bank accounts, so there would be multiple cash reconciliations and multiple UBNT accountants involved in the reconciliation process. If the cash was a fraud, the company would need multiple people to be in on it, which is not likely. In addition, KPMG would reperform the cash reconciliations using bank statements that come directly from the bank. Given the large balance, KPMG would focus a lot of attention on the cash, so the risk of fraud around cash is close to zero. In addition, given that the debt is secured by the cash, the lender (Wells Fargo) would have done some work to verify the cash being used as collateral.” Since then Wells Fargo has increased their loan to UBNT, which they would not do if they felt there was a significant risk of non-collection.Account receivable - $159M (14% of total assets) – For the year-end audit, KPMG would have sent out confirmations (similar to cash) to the major customers and have them confirm the balance owed. These confirmations would be sent back directly to KPMG. If there was a fraud related to inflating sales and accounts receivables, you would identify this pretty quickly because you would not be able to collect and would need to write off your receivables. Obviously, customers do not pay you unless they actually owe you the money. In addition, if they had a lot of write-offs, KPMG would require them to increase their allowance for doubtful provision account. So what is the provision you may ask. Only $461 as of 6/30 and $440 as of 12/31/17. Obviously not much risk here if they are reserving for less than $500…Inventories - $99M (8% of total assets) – For the year-end, a physical inventory count would validate the quantities on the balance sheet. The physical would be attended by KPMG who would perform test counts. From a costing perspective, it is pretty easy to audit. There is no complex cost accounting to go through as they outsource the manufacturing. The cost is basically what they pay to the manufacturing vendor, which is quite easy to audit. The biggest risk from an audit standpoint is the excess & obsolescence allowance. Given how quickly UBNT reserved for the FrontRow inventory, they appear to be pretty quick to reserve against inventory and this is an area that KPMG would look at very closely.Vendor deposits - $55M (5% of total assets) – I believe this would be prepaying the vendor for manufacturing costs. Some of this was already reserved against as some deposits related to FrontRow inventory manufacturing. From an audit standpoint, vendor deposits are quite easy to audit. You can trace the payments and confirm the balance at year-end.So just like that we have covered 98% of the total assets. Note that property, plant and equipment makes up only 1% of total assets, so the risk of capitalizing expenses is not high given that you can’t hide much within an account that makes up 1% of your assets.On the liabilities side, debt makes up $468M or 68% of total liabilities. This is really easy to audit as Wells Fargo is more than happy to confirm what UBNT owes them. Another $143M or 21% is made of taxes payable (mostly long-term). This is a little more complex, but KPMG will have their best tax people looking at this, so I am not concerned about the auditing risk here. The rest of the liabilities are made up of accounts payables and other current liabilities, which is generally pretty straightforward. If these were misstated, you would quickly see that as these liabilities would turn over pretty fast (they are mostly all classified as short-term).From an audit perspective, the financials are quite easy to audit, so I don’t see much risk of material financial misstatement. In terms of typical audit risks, they are not overly significant here:- Revenue recognition – I think this is pretty straightforward and no complex multiple elements arrangements here. They would just recognize revenue upon shipment to the customer. They have stated that the new rules (ASC 606) which go into effect Q1 2019 will not materially impact them. That would be mostly due to the fact that there are no complexities.- Inventory costing – I discussed this above, but typical manufacturing companies have complex costing where you have to estimate the costs by part, which includes material, labor and overhead. Since UBNT buys from the manufacturer, they would just use the price paid to them as their inventory costs.- Capitalizing expenses – This is where WorldCom focused their fraud. They were able to increase their reported income by capitalizing expenses (turning expenses into depreciable assets). Given the simplicity of their balance sheet, UBNT would have difficulty hiding these types of expenses especially since they don’t manufacture their inventory.- Goodwill – This is a very judgmental area as it is difficult to value this. Luckily for us, UBNT has no goodwill since they don’t make acquisitions.KPMG knows their reputation is on the line. They wouldn’t sign off on the year-end financials unless they covered their themselves. They obviously know what happened to Arthur Andersen and the $1.435M audit fee is not enough for them to take on any risk of PCAOB findings through a sloppy audit. I live in the SOX world and I know the PCAOB keeps the Big 4 partners up at night, so they will dot all their i’s and cross their t’s.The strongest proof for me that UBNT is not a fraud is Pera’s ownership. Although he sold 1M share last year (related to being ready for any action coming out of the Grizzlies buyout clause), he has not sold any additional shares. He owns 56.3M shares, which makes up 72.4% of the company. In addition, the company has been eagerly buying back shares. Pera takes no pay from the company, so his gain is through equity appreciation. If you were running a fraud, wouldn’t you sell off your shares as fast as you could without causing the stock price to crash?I bought some Jan 2020 $50 calls today and will be looking to buy more if shares don’t rally over the next week.",

During Q&A after c-call this morning they implied that they will be adding ~10 more propstream crews in 2018 and that the pace of team creation will be front loaded in the 1H of the year. IMO propstream crews are how they will take market share from competitors. Those crews are the public face of the company when interacting with E&P. Large IOCs like to deal with dominant players and propstream gives HCLP the ability to be a one stop shop for those IOCs.On the c-call I heard a lot of ""ownership"" statements from the CEO.

Shale activity was huge in 2017 and the price went from $20 to $8. The only people crushed were investors. Likewise for investors in all other sand companies. Shale activity will again be huge in 2018 - lets hope the market is more rational this time around. Hi Crush uber-bulls need pare back expectations - the only certainty is that the market is very often irrational.,
"Good grief Trent, you are WAY off the mark on this one.Did you completely forget that it was, in fact, a CN rail SNAFU (lack of enough crews), that cost HCLP 200K tons of sand sales in 3Q17?  It was the absence of those revenues that caused them to miss analysts estimates.  This isn't ancient history, it was LAST quarter!Now this...http://bit.ly/2C1Jfjg***The shortfall comes amid growing demand from other sectors, including frac sand***, said Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Winnipeg, Manitoba-based Western Grain Elevator Association,  which represents the country’s largest grain shippers, including Richardson International Ltd. and Cargill Ltd.Railways are also struggling to accommodate a surge of oil after several years of slower production growth. The as much as 45% surge in demand to ship crude by rail in the third quarter “caught us a little bit by surprise,” Ghislain Houle, Canadian National Railway’s chief financial officer, said Tuesday at a conference.The boom in production coupled with the rail delays means that inventories are building up in Alberta, where it’s priced. Canadian heavy oil’s discount to West Texas Intermediate futures widened to $30.60/bbl last week, the biggest discount since December 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show.""..Among the demands from grain, oil, and sand, these Canadians can't seem to manage demand growth.  Given this is the type of ""logistical bottleneck"" that caused HCLP to miss estimates last quarter, I wouldn't be quite so quick to dismiss the problem, as somehow an opportunity in disguise.Didn't you once say their logistical capabilities are their strength?  If the RR they are dependent on is suspect, maybe they are too?",

Then, MoviePass looks to get a piece of the ticket revenue from theater owners and the sales from concession stands (popcorn, drinks, candy) that MoviePass moviegoers generate.  To date they have agreements with 1000 theaters nationwide and growing.Movie theater owners will be willing to team up with MoviePass because research shows MoviePass moviegoers can lift attendance by as much as 123%. That’s a crazy high number and one that’s going to attract the attention of movie theater owners.Finally, MoviePass is able to see the movie habits of millions of moviegoers every day. This gives the company the highest-quality database of information on people’s moviegoing habits.That information is pure gold to movie companies because it helps them figure out production budgets and marketing angles for movies. And just like Netflix, Facebook, Amazon and Google, MoviePass will easily be able to take its business global because it’s based on a simple smartphone app platform and people’s love for the movies.",

Load up any official MoviePass social media posting and read the comments. It's scary stuff. Some folks have been billed for months without receiving their cards. The app doesn't work for some users. Refund requests have proven to be a challenge. Costco is going to have a pretty angry membership base if MoviePass doesn't get its act together.",

I mean they are open for business every day and these movies are on , even if there is one customer, they are programmed that way, right? So why wouldn't they accept and audience from MP that will buy the popcorn and coke, a lot of money in that, at a fair price instead of running the theatre empty and no popcorn to sell. I know I'm not as articulate as most of you are but I hope you're getting my point. I mean if you can't sell the movie why not sell the popcorn?",

I might as well give MP the door keys as well. Further, why would I risk running up a big tab on the ticket side. When they fail-meaning MoviePass, someone is going to get stuck for a lot of ticket rev.The flaw is that the MoviePass people are collecting a years fee, plus a processing charge in advance. This is classic pyramid marketing. We've seen it a hundred times and it always takes new form and comes back again. When the rate of new subs fall off, the people behind MP will simply file BK.

"To address all the comments around theaters doing their own subscriptions... They simply can't do that and compete with MoviePass.  They can't do a joint one and they can't do individual ones.  That is very simple thinking that requires much deeper analysis than what I have seen here.  Their entire model and relationship with studios would have to change AND they do not possess the technology to do it.  Yes, I know some of you think ""it's just a mastercard"".  That is far from all it is.  They have patented technology associated with the mastercard and how it works with the app.  Also, the cost of entry is enormous.  Are they going to try to spend the 100's of millions it will take to develop the subscriber base that MoviePass is currently spending?  Can they monetize the subscriber base in the ways that MP can?  The answer is no.  Even beyond the things I have brought up, there are so many other things to think about.  It is so elementary school thinking to just say that they can do their own subscriber program and MoviePass is done.  Very elementary.  Open your minds and actually analyze this.  Now, I am not saying MP will be successful either.  Don't get me wrong.  But they have a far better chance of pulling it off than any single movie theater does.",
"Now let us introduce you RestaurantPass - paying $50/month you can go to dining anywhere you want one meal per day!Look how DISRUPTIVE this is -1) people will initially go out many time per month, but that is fine, because after couple of months of excitement, they will settle down to 1 meal/month. Remember the gym membership model?2) it will drive much more customer into the restaurant. We expect 2mm subscribers in 3 months and it helps the highly competitive restaurant business!3) Once we have enough users, we can reach revenue sharing deal with big chains like McDonalds or Chipotle to do revenue share like $3/meal, if they don't come on board, we will delist 10 of biggest restaurants from our network! ( we may also contact their board, just saying )4) oh don't forget we have data! we can track how consumer eating habit and sell them. That is worth A LOT. We can also use data to do advertising or we can buy a restaurant and use our data to drive the customer!5) oh oh and if our model did not work out, so does the whole restaurant industry, once consumer get used to this cheap subscription model, they will never come back to pay $10 for a meal!6) Don't worry about cash flow, they are ample investors there and we can potentially IPO or doing ICO or just bought out by big guys like AMZN or GOOG.

This also touches the issue whether MP can work for only small budged niche movies or the big ones.Theaters have little to do with all this, so if MP strikes deals, it should be with the studios at all.And still, more than 3 per month visits in general over their lifetime seems to be hard to break even.I just glanced over NFLX financials and even they struggle to survive.

"Ben, thanks for all your info and outlook.   Posting again here at the end of this thread in regard to your comment much higher up as not sure if it will be seen.Regal, and AMC, and Cinemark, and RealD and IMAX can join forces to offer their own combined three plus theater chain subscription service, and corner the movie theater market. Such theater access subscription likely would be very attractive to a majority of theater goers in the U.S. as these three theater chains, plus smaller specialty exhibitors, comprise most movie screens nationwide. Exhibition clout would be with the movie theaters themselves. Possibly some independent theaters and small to mid chains would hop on board with this nationwide theater subscription service as well. Such co-branded single subscription service seems would be a bane to MoviePass.  MoviePass is without doubt a disruptor, yet the theater subscription model is now the cat out of the bag.  Your moat idea has not made reference to a combined multi-theater chain subscription service, which seems would take much less capitial to implement with already a theater exhibition infrastructure well in place.Your thoughts on this? A poster here suggested anti-trust concerns, yet a co-branded shared service on its face seems not likely an anti-trust issue as each exhibitor theater chain or company would remain a separate corporate entity.

I stopped reading every comment and just scanned the rest once he started giving one-word answers.To me, MP's advantage over the theaters is that their debit card system allows them to be used at EVERY theater. AMC, Cinemark, etc. can't block a MasterCard being used to pay for a transaction. Sure, they can do their own plans, but a ""AMC only"" subscription will only work in a market where AMC has a monopoly and there are no other theaters. Maybe I'm being naive, but my intuition tells me that there are very few places around the country where there is only one theater chain that dominates the entire city. And you need massive scale in order to pull this off. So I just see the ""theater chains will beat MP"" argument as very weak.",

"Why would they offer 30 movies a month for 9.99? When they can cut a deal with MP for 30% off ticket price.... Assume a person goes to the movies 4 a month... with their own program they would only get $9.99 in revenue plus whatever that person spends in popcorn and sodas... on the other hand, if they work with MP, a person that goes to the movies 4 times in a month would generate $28 ( $7 MP discounted price x 4) plus what they spend on popcorn...Movie theaters wont implement their own programs because it is cheaper and it generates more revenue to work with MP than to have their own program",

"http://bit.ly/2C22JEKAnother beverage company endorsed by celebrity athletes has suffered an even worse fate. In early 2008, just a few months after launching a new health drink, the Purple Beverage Company (PPBV) began inking deals with professional baseball players to promote its product. By March of that year, the company’s stock had racked up such incredible gains that it caught the attention of Forbes despite its penny-stock status.After rocketing 49,000% to almost $3 a share in just five short months, Forbes noted at the time, PPBV boasted a $152 million market value that was 105 times greater than the actual book value of the company.Over the course of the next several months, PPBV continued to add some big names – including legendary Yankees relief pitcher Mariano Rivera – to its team. But the company’s winning streak had ended by early 2009, when Forbes revisited the stock and found it trading for just one penny a share. PPBV’s founding CEO, Ted Farnsworth, has departed from the company since that time.“After going through a very difficult time over the last several months, we are now reenergized,” Farnsworth proclaimed on his way out the door. “This (management change) is a positive move for the company, the brand and the shareholders.”Eight months later, PPBV trades on the lowly Pink Sheets for a fraction of a penny a share.",

"Julian, You are truly a simple minded creaton. Instead of asking “what if” amc or some other movie chain comes up with a competing service, the better question is why haven’t they yet?? They haven’t because AMC does not want their costumers accustomed to a lower price point. In fact the last thing they want to do is alienate their diminishing customer base by giving them something they have to take away eventually. By using an external vehicle, they can maintain status quo yet benefit from higher attendance and more money from concessions. The more customers MoviePass get, the more leverage they have and the theaters would be idiots not to profit share with the same people who have driven up their concession revenues. It’s already happening, AMC is holding back because of the ego of their idiot CEO. The same person responsible for the destruction of AMC shareholder value. They will also come around eventually.",
"Speak as a costumer, I thought Netflix was doomed when they tried to split into two different companies (DVD and streaming) and charge more for each service. They admitted their mistake and altered course. There's no clear and established model for how to transform these industry disrupting companies into a success. Anyone making certain declarations about success or failure should probably just zip it.",
Julian...  u just wrote an article less than 24 hrs ago with good words for MP and now 180 degrees dif.   I think they call that disease bi-polar?!?!?,
"Moviepass/HMNY says:1. 2 million customers, fastest subscription service in history.2. Not losing much money right now.3. Estimated profitability at 3-4 million customers -- which should be by spring/summer.4. Typical user goes to 3 movies first month, gradually declines to about 1 by month 3.5. The bulk of new customers are increasingly occasional moviegoers not people who go every week.6. Lots of deals with independent movie theaters for revenue sharing.7. Lots of deals with studios to market movies.8. Plenty of cash to reach profitability.On the downside:1. Disastrously dilutive sale of stock at prices that sent shares plunging.2. Executive compensation that looks questionable.3. Those two things don't give you a high level of confidence in management.OK that is a summary of what the parent company and or Mitch and Moviepass have said in the last couple months. And the main criticism.As I see it, if the company has been honest -- a big if -- the results should be clear within no more than six months. We should see the company become cash flow neutral and perhaps plans for an IPO or a buyout where the parent company changes its name.Under that scenario the stock should be a lot higher. If they have been lying about some or all of those things - within the realm of possibility, though risking jail if so -- then the stock could well go to zero.I am long, but I am eager to see some actual financial data and details that support the claims made in interviews. I sometimes wonder if holding the stock is worth the trouble to keep up with the details. I would like to see some published financial data for moviepass soon.",

"I just finished taking a third MP survey. They're now directly asking what people want to change to make the MP experience better. I unloaded a bunch of ideas and options from making the card optional to save on overhead, to offering tiered pricing for access to different viewings. There is undoubtedly a lucrative plan with options for different scenarios. What public company would operate without milestones? Endgame is an odd word for 'vision'.Also, why in the world would you publicly make claims and be accountable if you're trying to rip the world off? This isn't a crypto company with untraceable leadership. You can't talk about publicly traded companies like they were single-minded entities with one person making all the decisions. If the shareholders want AMC, Cinemark, etc. to stop f***ing around and make a deal with MoviePass to the benefit of themselves and the rest of the industry, they'll do it. I guarantee you Seth Klarman wants his increased AMC stake to come out of the ashes.I'm upset about the dilution, I voted against it. I understand the need for capital. I know there's different ways of raising it and it sucks that this is the path we're all going down. They better be spending some of that money on buying out MP completely.

They don’t want or need a cut of ticket revenues from theaters - if you knew anything about the theater business you’d know there’s nothing to give (the theaters barely get any cut of ticket sales). The revenue source and deep pockets are the studios making the movies, the subsequent movie streaming rights on those movies, etc. and the huge advertising dollars and play and residuals associated with popular movies. By easily “pushing” millions of eventual card holders to targeted movies highlighted by the app, they will easily recoup costs and then some. Amazon has been intentionally selling products at a loss for similar reasons. It’s called a “loss leader”. Hundreds of other viable examples (e.g. Uber), all very successful and indispensable in their respective industry literally transforming the World and economy as we know it.",

"Honestly, this is a pretty problematic article for you. You changed your mind from ""Movie Pass is here to stay"" to ""it's going to zero"" in 16 days, with no new financials or information from the company, at all.Your reason for changing your opinion is pretty much all based on speculation, and an analysis of a business plan that hasn't changed. If your analysis of the business is right, then you invested, and recommended that others invest, without properly analyzing it, a mere 16 days ago. It's not like the company's end game was going to emerge in the last 2 weeks.I don't like the way the company went about raising capital, but everyone knew perfectly well that additional cash inflow was going to be needed. Netflix needed it to get over the profitability hump, and everyone knew perfectly well that the ""Netflix of cinemas"" would need to do so, as well. They did it poorly, and hurt market confidence, but your flip flop on the company appears, much like the rest of the market's reaction, to be a simple emotional overreaction.I think it was Warren Buffet who said to, ""be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."" I added to my position at lower rates than the $5.50 per share that the institutional investors paid, and my opinion on the company's business plan hasn't changed in the last 16 days. It is still a high growth potential stock (with some admitted risk to go along with it), and that opinion won't change until I see something new from the company itself (ie. financials, an announcement about their planned end game, etc).",
"i think there is an endgame: it is about the value of data.a moviepass subscription is a loss leader; theaters that adopt a competing service it is just a loss.further those warrants are worth at least $3 because of the adjustable feature.  so they sold the stock for $2.50!  seems like no good reason to buy it at $5 when they just sold it for $2.50.there will hopefully be a chance to buy moviepass in a more ""pure"" form.  it needs a board that is more independent from management.",

It reminded me of the old Netflix mailing CD's - the more you used the service, the more it cost Netflix.

"As I stated before, there are major warning signs in the company. I will repost my last comment, but listen! Ted (The CEO) past 3 ventures all went to 0. He diluted share holders from running 3 different companies. Why would the 4th time be the charm. It’s like American Greed, people just keep investing.Repost: The real big warning signs came over the past 2 months. Ending service to AMC top 10 revenue theaters and cancelling subscriptions to clients. AMC informed them they never decline Moviepass and Moviepass responded by ending service to AMC biggest revenue theaters.1. Cancelling AMC Theaters: I believe they were cutting cost and so they could stop paying millions to AMC. On top of that, It benefited them because customers will still have to pay for the subscription but they will no longer have access to the close locations to home. Leaving the customer to think, is it really worth going to the next town?2. Cancelling Customer Accounts: Second way for them to cut cost without real reasoning. They recently announced they cancelled a small number of accounts because premium ticket buyers. So I investigated the reviews and many people that had accounts cancelled actually didn't buy any premium tickets, since they don't even do business with 3D or Imax theaters. What I also noticed, many of those customers were people that paid the $89.99 1 year deal. They already recieved 1 year upfront, so why keep letting you go to free movies every month.3. Delaying client's cards but still charging them $9.99-$7.95 per-month or a whole $89.99. There is a huge amount of client's that haven't received any cards yet and some as long as 6 months. This tactic gives them the right to limit the amount of people going to the theater but still charge them the full amount per-month. Clients won't cancel because they were informed they can't reopen accounts after cancellation. So if customer service is trying there hardest to get this issue resolved, how do you find time to read current customer tickets and cancel accounts when some people haven't even received cards. First tackle the big problem, getting clients cards in 1-3 days, then focus on ticket fraud.I personally don't think ticket fraud ever existed or AMC not accepting Moviepass goers, these are all tactics for them to cut cost as they are burning through cash. In return, they are saying blame the customer and movie theaters.Conclusion: These tactics will one day be presented on CNBC American Greed - Booommmmmm",

"Hey Julian, agree with you on this call. In the oilfield we have an expression TGTBT- to good to be true. Cinema chains have no reason to play with these guys.  They own the experience that movie-goers queue up for. Moviepass sounds like an internet teenager's science project.Where I live we have Cinemark. About 3 months ago they rolled out a very compelling program $8.95/mo which includes one movie per month, and a 20% discount on concessions. If you don't go in a month, your movie rolls over, so the next month you can have two, and so on..This is what the oilfield calls a DGD- Darn Good Deal. I am a member.Cinemark has totally redesigned their theaters in the last year. Now, you have an assigned seat that you select in advance. The seat is actually an over stuffed recliner. So, I go in, blow about 20 bucks in concessions, less the 20% discount, watch the premovie stuff, eat my popcorn and hotdog, and nod off about 10 minutes into the movie. It's the best nap you can get for $30 bucks.Cheers!",

Right now MP controls 5% of the box office, once that number reaches closer to 15% I think we will be in a very strong position. Management is driving sub growth to get us there.

You can say HMNY will continue to drop sure, but linking HMNYs stock price with MP success isn't one to one.#3 MP has no end game. Again no data to back this and purely speculation on your end.

Their only problem was along came the ""Mule"" (a mutant/renegade higher order 2nd Foundationist)   who upset their plan for 5 years as being similar to the arrival on the global stage of Donald Trump. Does not appear to me that it is possible for all the global debt to be repaid even if Trump get's resurgent growth therefore a debt reset (the plan via two tier currency local and global with the 2nd Foundation in charge) is baked in the cake.

"My opinion is to not touch Sears stock, long Seritage. Once the dust settles, I think Sears will have a 100’s of small foot print stores focusing on appliance repair, large appliance sales, and mattress sales only. Seritage will transform their properties as needed, with a small portion being rented by Sears small size concept. Sears will no longer be a 1000+ large store front company. I think Eddie continues to drain Sears equity, and secure his debt positions, until Seritage is in the clear (not relying on Sears rent). Then, Sears will have a major transformation (Eddie will take it private OR chapter11). He is smarter than you and I, so it is hard to tell what he has up his sleeve at this time. Long Seritage.",

FUV has a mcap of only 45M and burns half of this or RD p.a with the same cash available. Why?,Electra Meccanica Files For Nasdaq IPO
Another short selling Author trying desperately to cover his short..smh,
Allegedly at the Maxim conference on 2/13 it was highlighted that HMNY had no debt BUT their filing two days later on 2/15 shows they DO have $29mm of convertible debt outstanding.  So I believe the filing with $29mm debt as it is a SEC registered fact,
"The main point of this article is that the financing was really bad and dilutive to shareholders.  Right?  So let's take a look at some calculations.  Exact share counts before this last offering and after this latest offering:  Pre dilution 23.99 million. Post dilution 37.89 million. What is MP worth?  HMNY said 300 million.  I calculate that by taking 45.5 million paid for 16% more ownership (from 62% to 78%).  I am rounding up slightly.  Pre dilution shareholders now own 63.31% of the company value (23.99/37.89 = 63.31%). Pre dilution share holders owned: 300 million x 62% = 186 million x 100% of shares = 186 million. Pre dilution share holders now own: 300 million x 78% = 234 million + 60 million cash remaining (105 less 45 paid for 16% more of MP) = 294 million x 63.31% of shares = 186 million. So no immediate dilution to the existing shareholders.  However, we must acknowledge the warrants may further dilute in the future.  But how much more value will the company create before the warrants are exercised because of this financing?  Could still be a wash or a cost.  We don't know for sure.  Finally, there was a big deal made about warrants adjusting downward in December 2018.  I would say that is a big deal if the share value is less than strike price in 12/2018, but if more, it really does not matter, does it?  Conclusion:  Unless I have something wrong here, I think the author needs to retract or rewrite the article.  I am happy to have anyone correct my numbers if I have something wrong.",
"MP is operating in ""full desperation"" mode, IMHO.They will burn a ton of cash on the Black Panther release.",
"""As a further indication of reality, it's very interesting to note that HMNY did not include the warrant adjustment provision in the preliminary Prospectus Supplement for the deal (see page S-16). The adjustment provision, therefore, was never intended to be included in the warrants. It was required by buyers during the pricing. HMNY, clearly out of funds, had no choice but to accept the terms.""Stock Stooge,This is Brilliant catch. This is the reading between the lines. This is human intelligence.

We are now in the SLOWEST movie season of the year until late May.  And MP's growth rate will probably slow (on a percentage basis, meaning more existing customers seeing fewer movies / month vs. new customers seeing more movies in first month).That put MP at a $22.5 million monthly loss last 2 months (Dec was likely higher, Jan much lower), and likely slowing WAY down now until end of May.You say ""$57 million month loss"" above.

Was strange it took them so long to find something,
"Regarding KKR motivations - despite the 23% reduction from a $1.75 conversion price floor value to $1.35, they don't look like great winners here.  The PV of NOLs dropped in value by 40% when the corporate income tax rate change was passed and if you believe the NSM DTA valuation of $1.26B, the PV of WMIH cash+NOLs dropped by ~30% with the new tax law.KKR appear supportive of the deal, so they must feel the intrinsic value is greater than current market price (and greater than a straight conversion to cash), but I see no great motivation for them to have dragged this out for so long.  On the contrary, the earlier a deal was cut the higher the potential IRR for KKR, and the lower the bleed from pre-combination operating costs.  I'm not an expert on WMIH, so perhaps I am missing something.",
"Masbro, thanks for the article. NSM has paid almost no cash taxes in the last few years, but perhaps they will generate the projected income to utilize the NOLs (I'm not convinced).The big risk here is that the NSM business begins to deteriorate before the deal closes.  They make very little in the way of true operating servicing income (excluding mark-to-market adjutsments that are non-cash).  Most of their operating income comes from originations which could suffer with rising interest rates.  They talked up the potential growth in originations on the last quarterly call based on rising consumer debt, but made no mention of interest rate impacts.  Guided close is actually Q2 2018 vs Q3.",
"Thanks for your analysis.  It is straight forward and easy to understand.  I think NSM did a terrible job explaining the deal on their conference call.  It is a very unusual deal since there is almost no premium being paid by WMIH, but NSM retains control of the Board.  It is an acquisition with no premium and no change of control.  Very odd.The hard thing to understand is why did they do it?  I can think of only two reasons. 1) FIG is liquidating all their historical investments now that Softbank has bought them and they have new and better things to do; so they are desperate to get liquid and forced the deal as the controlling shareholder for their own reasons, and 2)  NSM cannot possible use up $6B in NOLs, so NSM management (who keep all their jobs) sees this as a vehicle with a new deep pocketed sponsor to roll up a lot more companies (I wonder what the new compensation plan will be for NSM management - this will tell us a lot of why this deal was done).So we have a deal which will leave us with dead money for 6 to 9 months waiting for approvals with little downside but also a fairly small upside in the interim.  The only reason to hold the stock is that NSM management have demonstrated that they are very competent and they are going to grow this vehicle by acquisition into something that could actually use up $6B in NOLs.  The upside in that case could be very significant.",

I also looked up the other drug trials with keytruda and drew the same conclusion. I'm not even sure it matters because those drugs don't target galectins. In fact grmd02 could potentially be used in combination therapy for many different indications and not compete directly with any other drug.,

"Hi Otto Capital, I have a few questions:1. Why are you using Keytruda for revenue comparison, and where did you get 5% from? Was it arbitrary? Keytruda is approved for the treatment of several cancers, including certain patients with metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and urothelial carcinoma, amongst others. How does this relate to GALT’s drug which is currently in Phase 2 trial for treatment of a subgroup of NASH cirrhosis patients & in Phase 1b trial with Keytruda for advanced melanoma? Also, other compounds (epacadostat, indoximod, etc.) in combination therapy with Keytruda are much further along in clinical testing with better trial results.For these reasons, would you agree that an estimate of even 5% of Keytruda annual sales at this point is unwarranted?2. The company voted on 12/19/17 to double the amount of authorized common shares from 50 million to 100 million, which I believe to be indicative of intent of future share offering(s). Do you agree?3. I disagree with your claim that comments from industry experts & the credit line from Richard Uihlein (who already had personal interest in the success of the company) ""seem like a good bet that they find [a partnership]"". Mergers and acquisitions have been low in the past year relative to previous years, and GALT has a lot to prove trial-wise before potential partners &/or buyers come in with offers. Current results from the GR-MD-02 with Keytruda combination trial for treatment of advanced melanoma only include results from 5 of 8 test subjects, which holds little to no statistical significance. Further, with 21,218,760 warrants/options issued and outstanding, and 2.5 million B-series 8% preferred convertible stock, the likelihood of a buyout in the next 1-2 years seems very improbable in my opinion. What do you think of these facts?Lastly, I feel the comment that the ""risk return equation significantly skewed to the upside"" for GALT may be untrue considering the extremely high volatility (>140% HV for the past 20 days) and recent jump in stock price. But that's just my opinion.Thanks for writing the article, I look forward to hearing your follow up thoughts!",

"Good article Fun, but I think you may be off on the age of the fleet, it’s not as old as it appears to be on paper:Apex and Onyx both had major upgrades in 2014. Monarch, Rover and Endeavour received major upgrades around 2006 -2008. Patriot received the same in 2012. These upgrades basically consisted of replacing the whole topside and drilling package with new modern equipment. That new package sits on the existing bottom side that only supports the floating/stability functions. These bottom sides are stout and made to last. No need to replace them on moored facilities. The point is, although these rigs are documented to be built in the 70,’s they are in fact quite modern highly capable units. Of the ten rigs you have cited to be retired in the next 2 years, I suggest that number to be more like 4-5.Fully agree though that Edwards needs to pull the trigger on M&A or acquisition of distressed assets very soon to remain competitive.Oh and it’s Ocean Great White, not Ocean Shark.Enjoy your articles, keep up the great work",

I know the age old knock on DO is that it was conservative in the last boom (2010-2014) and didn't invest as heavily in it's fleet as other OSDs (6th/7th Gen assets). Because they didn't overspend like most of the competition DO has the healthiest balance sheet and greatest ability to weather the storm. What if in the next year or two DO was to take advantage of its strong balance sheet and announce multiple orders for the Floating Factory DS. DO would then have in my opinion the most most capable/desirable Drillships in the world displacing other Offshore Drilling Co.'s 6th Gen assets. Because other OSD don't have the financial strength of DO it would make it more difficult for them to catch up. Not to mention I believe the FF concept is Patent protected. What if DO's fleet in 10 years looks like this: 4 Blackships, GW, Courage, Valor, & 5-10 Floating Factories... Wouldn't that be a game changer?

Sure, you can probably get oil out for that price and make a profit, but you need to take a really long view on oil to commit masses of capex when first oil is so far away.

"Cramer is like the rest of the peanut gallery that wants CMG to have an ""orthodox"" leader instead of ""reformed"" (to put a religious twist on the CEO). They just will abide changes around the periphery, not core changes to the menu. And look at the menu. Does anybody ever talk about CMG tacos?? Hardly. Why?? I have had them and they are nothing to get excited about. In fact the burger joint down the road from my CMG is the place I go for tacos. Its pretty bad when a place known for cheese burgers makes better tasting tacos than you. It could be the new (he has owned it now for a couple years) owner is hispanic and he decided to add tacos to the menu. He has taco tuesdays and the place is packed for lunch.  Also I never knew CMG sold beer and alcohol. For most restaurants, alcohol sales provide a large percentage of the profit. Why arent drinks marketed more?? CMG is basicially a one trick pony (burritos) and that is it (oh and you can get some queso on the side now whooopeeee we are saved!!). If people really want the stock to get back to 400 two things need to happen. First, Niccol needs to clean house and fire everybody Ells hired, especially crumpacker and the other arrogant top people. Ells then needs to step down completely away from the company. Then the stores need to be rebranded with a new better menu so that a fresh start is had and the old CMG associated with getting sick is gone.

"Long term the argument is probably correct however the short and medium term may be quite different:1.) After Amazon's IPO the stock had a rapid price rise, but it then had an equally rapid price decline that lasted for years.  Aphria along the other major cannabis companies had a phenomenal price spike in 2017 and a much smaller retracement in 2018.  Are we now at the bottom?  I doubt it. Expect more in the way of short term correction and be prepared for a long wait for the inevitable price rise.  2.) Getting production up to scale is the name of the game right now just as ""grabbing eyeballs"" was the mantra of the dotcom boom.  For most companies that is where the battle will be won or lost.  There won't be profits in the short run but there will be immense costs.  3.) Demand today is just a small percentage of total demand that pot companies are planning for.  Oversupply for the next 1-3 years is going to be a big drag on profitability.  Pot price are falling and we should expect that trend to continue, possibly even accelerate as more capacity floods the market.

Anyone have thoughts on today’s results and call?,
"Timok looks good deposit, but there are few points that we can't forget:1) To build a mine is complicated and there are political and operational risk overall in a huge project like this, with 4 years of development, could be delays.2) Estimated FCF from Timok is not regular, a lot during the first years which is expected to be reduced quickly according to their own estimates. This point is important for the valuation.3) Nevsun only has 60% of Bisha, FCF generated from there to Nevsun (about $40M past year) is far from being enough to develop Timok. And Bisha has only 3 years left to live.4) Nevsun will finance 50-70% of Timok project, wich is minimum $350M. They didn't say how but in the last PR they said: ""the Company is currently evaluating options for sourcing additional capital, including equity, convertible debt, precious metal streaming, and strategic partnerships.""In my opinion they are clearing the house to sell it.",

So I will retract Bisha comments. Timok drilling results are mixed. There is a lot of uncertainty about recovery grades and commodity prices. But to not wish for 60-100% upside on a takeover is foolish. Unless you think you can double you money in the three years you’ve waited, and the next three years it will take for Timok to produce and the stock to appreciate.",
"I’ll repeat my criticism. If you bought in at 2.45 USD three years ago, you have watched NSU miss out on all the cyclical action, and drop 20 cents on both Timok and Bisha concerns. And the biggest risk is still a takeover with 60-100 percent upside?  That seems far too counter intuitive to me. Seems like three years of dead money to me. And I’m long NSU. I’d love to see Freeport or Lundin take them out. Both companies are very in tune with the NSU story. LUN even looking to deploy capital. But no interest there. To me, that’s telling.",

"That's really too bad.  It would have been very interesting to watch how you would continue to twist and spin GM's faltering pickup sales on a month to month basis, even under heavy cash incentive giveaways for the outdated and outgoing model, while Ford's pickup sales remain strong, steady to rising at near-record levels, as somehow a signal that Ford was in trouble.  If anything, it may mean that Ford needs some additional plant capacity for their trucks, while GM is about one truck factory too many.  Well, fortunately with the Ranger coming in a few months, that should relieve the burden slightly for the overworked Ford workers at the Dearborn and Kansas City truck plants.By the way, it is also very interesting that GM has decided to stop publishing monthly sales, in saying ""a 30-day period doesn’t provide an adequate snapshot of the company’s complex business or the broader industry"".  What does that say about - a) the statistical significance of your approach to judging an automaker's fitness based on a single month of pickup sales on a year over year basis, with no regards to the context, and b) GM's confidence in selling itself?  It almost seems GM is trying to follow Tesla's lead in only reporting the quarterly production goals and actuals, leaving it to industry analysts to try to track down how many they actually sold and delivered to customers.  News flash, if GM does it, chances are the other automakers, including Ford, will start to follow suit.  The monthly sales have become more about the temporary opiate high and the hyped up bragging rights.  With Ford winning the race month after month in pickup sales for the last few decades, maybe GM has decided it is time to throw in the towel and focus instead on the big picture, whatever that might be. It might make updating the earnings forecasts a little harder for the industry analysts too.  Their life blood is the reported monthly sales figures, so they can go back and recalculate the likely profits on those sales.  This may tend to put a bit of a damper on the market volatility that tends to happen as monthly sales reports come out, and the analysts revise their earnings forecasts and recommendations.Ah well.

"Hi, I'm a little late to this party, but thanks for the article.You know, I think F is a fine company - and one of my most frustrating investments, ever. I have no current position in F, but I do have a position in GM, which I recently initiated (although I have written some longer dated calls against my GM shares). To me, GM has a very good CEO in charge of things (IMHO, best CEO GM's had in my lifetime), who has made a lot of good calls; GM's out of markets where they have not been able to make a buck (e.g., Europe), has a decent overall product line, a good balance sheet, and good operating leverage. If this was ""it"", though, I'd not have invested in GM; personally, I think growth in SAAR is getting a little long in the tooth. The differentiating factor with me is GM's technological edge, culminating in its 'TaaS' initiative (i.e., Uber with robots). This is, potentially, a disruptive business (""if"" it works). GM wants to use Bolt as the basic platform for the service, seeing an advantage in marrying AV with BEV. I think F is late to this game, and this is in good part why F has a new CEO. If I'm not mistaken, F has gone 'all in' to develop BEV vehicles. Not so sure what their stance is on AV, but I would assume they are all in, here, too (I'd presume Waymo would be happy to assist).    I won't dispute that F has its own strengths; my own opinion is that the F series seems to be king of that hill, for example. But I think the market sees F as late to seeing the industry's way forward, and thus having to shell out billions to catch up, with the shares being penalized as a result.  At the end of the day, F is still an auto/truck OEM subject to the risks of a cyclical business, but also a business that is rapidly changing. GM is still principally an OEM, too, but I think it is also seen as being on the leading edge of industry change. E.g., it has a chance to be a big-time disruptor with TaaS; 'if' TaaS works, GM will start to generate a lot of recurring, fee-based income, which should 'smooth' their revenue profile. I admit it may take a while for this to work, if it does at all. But I'm willing to take that chance - I think GM has its act together, and is the auto OEM I want to own.We'll see.

"GM is shrinking their global footprint while Ford is growing theirs.  The best time to get in to any company is when they are going regional to national or, national to global.  It is always capital intensive which hurts share price now but, there is always a large increase in earnings and share price later.  Car sales in North America seem to be plateaued.  Much of the world is just starting to ramp up.  Also all of the new products they are testing right now will bring profits later.  While GM is still just selling cars, Ford will be selling transportation in many forms everywhere. And, the big thing I like about Ford is that they have a huge war chest for the next recession.  While shareholders saw share price drop in the last one, it did not go to zero like GM's did.  Recessions will happen.  I would rather be in a company that can handle it than one that will just crumble.",

I bought several hundred shares at 10.43 so I am more interested in the dividend than Capitol gains. Ford does have a problem in losing some market share. It appears Ford is more interested in per vehicle ( especially their trucks) profit margin than selling a large quantity of vehicles. Just how long can that work out?

"Take my two cents on Cisco for what it's worth. I first bought Cisco in about '93 when Valentine and some other guy were co-CEO's, and their biggest competitor was 3com (sp.?). Organic growth really slowed for Cisco in the late 90's when they switched to an acquisition based growth model. They were fat and lazy, preferring to let start ups do the innovating and buying them up as early as possible with their fat check book. They relied on great product breadth and depth to lock in customers despite their crappy engineering and high prices. Many years later when they sued Arista I pretty much assumed it was a corporate maneuver rather than a merit based lawsuit. After Arista got it's first favorable court ruling I bought ANET. I read an article the other day where it was asserted that the ""Tiger Team"" that Cisco had put together to take on Arista in the 400 gigabyte  products coming in a year or two would take out Arista. That's a lot of wishful thinking in my opinion.",
"Call me crazy everybody, but I suggest you buy today because I have a feeling we end up closing today somewhere between 280 and 300.",
Good analysis. Thanks!,
"Thanks Stephen for sharing this research on ANET, that was one of the most comprehensive articles, I've ever read on this company here on SA. I have had this company on my watch-list for over a year, but never pulled the trigger on buying shares due to it's legal issues with CSCO. Execution wise, they've been hitting the ball out of the ballpark, so share price certainly looks justified with the big drop AH. The public cloud is anticipated to grow to $500B by 2024. Do you know how big of a pie will that be for CSCO and ANET? ANET could likely have 50% market share of SDN by then.",
"I will add a little tomorrow if this opens as indicated. Then I will watch between 2:30pm and 4pm to see if the market holds and if ANET starts to recover.Furthermore, before adding any more after that, the 3 day rule will apply to see the price action and analyst community notes that are released.Good luck to everyone.",
Well researched and written article Stephen. I 've been out of ANET for about a month and will base future purchases more on market conditions than performance of the company.,

Overnight!!What is your opinion on the earnings and subsequent selloff? Overeaction? Selloff overdone? Would you be buying right away or waiting a few days.Regards,Shane",
"Arista has real organic growth and they are taking market share from Cisco. The total market has been growing at about 2%. Cisco strength is a broad product line and a massive install base. Arista is growing by gaining market share, while Cisco has implemented a software license based revenue model. This revenue model is in fact a price increase. So as the license based model works it's was thought the Cisco install base revenues will increase. This should provide pricing flexibility to Arista and others. It should also mean no margin pressure. The other interesting thing is Robbins great savior was Security. I see Cisco grew at 6% which is less than one half the growth of the market.The point here is if Arista continues to do what they are doing and expands their product offerings they will be eating Cisco's lunch for years to come. I have no clue where the stock will go, but it is clear the company is on a long term growth path.",

Thank you for the thorough and even-handed summary of ANET.  Recent long as it has been under my radar until several months ago; lucky to buy a starting position on a good dip.

How are they communicating with investors?  How are they squashing articles that indicate heir drug is cherry picking results?   How are they working partnerships and institutions to proceed to the next steps?   I think this is the main risk and critical point missing in the article that nobody every really talks about.

"Really great, superb job SOF !! Thanks. and efficiently worded ! very clear ! I can help as I spoke to company when notice stock price dip and went into detail twice with them to be very clear about this....first I will say that the English on Healios video was a bit hard for 1 hill billy like myself but I did pick up that they were referring as you correctly  figured to the EXTRA year followup  that has NOTHING to do with the official END OF STUDY.  In fact at first I was questioning them about the aspire details as I thought people figured dilution and sold. .but they felt it was the misunderstanding about the Healios statement that most everyone misinterpreted as adding over another year when that is simply not correct....I had been waiting to add based on three possibilities. partnerships Europe or US or no partnership and possible secondary or third ARDS news.  good up bad one last dip UNLESS partnership news first.  So Aspire is NOT to finance study here or Europe, but I agree with you it is great bargaining   tool or enough cash to easily get to Healios results which i believe will take care of everything going forward. Was able to protect myself with some cheap nearby options in case big partnership deal hits until this news pushed stock down..secondary imo would have been 1.15 or 1.20 area so this was wise move and except for an ARDS failure should it come before partnership  I see no more bad news ahead.. they have what they need to get this to market imo.. Japan has oldest living population and therefore much stroke risk. The Japanese FDA equivalent can move much quicker than ours and their fast track is 6 months not 12. However, I expect things to move very rapidly and if they decide it works and is safe They can issue conditional approval for 7 years or total approval forever....  they would continue the study  of course and the extra year followup...SOF your red box ""TREASUES"" clearly states end period is 90 days AFTER last person treated (thus enrolled).

We have a broad patent estate with claims directed to compositions, methods of production, and methods of use of certain nonembryonic stem cells and related technologies. We developed, acquired and exclusively licensed intellectual property covering our cell therapy product candidates and other applications in the field. Our broad intellectual property portfolio consists of nearly 200 issued patents (of which 21 are United States patents) and more than 170 global patent applications around our stem cell technology and MultiStem product platform. This includes twenty United States patents and more than 135 international patents that apply to MAPC and related products, such as MultiStem. The current intellectual property estate, which incorporates additional filings and may broaden over time, could provide coverage for our stem cell product candidates, manufacturing processes and methods of use through 2032 and beyond.

Hopefully the same patent protection applies to the mfgr process as well.Note: You would think that ATHX would post more of this patent information (as you provided) on its website, not only as an expected courtesy to existing shareholders but also to help inform potential new investors or hospitals/funding sources to help view ATHX more favorably!

Athersys has financial problems and just one pivotal trial ongoing in Japan. My take-away is to stay here on the sideline and put my noney into Pluristem and /or Mesoblast with their much brader stem cell pipelines.

Why else would they seem to be mentioned in the Aspire agreement? Thank you",
"Thank you for the well-worded write-up.  I agree that the Aspire agreement (again, a re-up of a prior agreement) will provide access to capital and is certainly preferable to the disastrous secondary that ATHX presented to its shareholders a year ago.  I do not feel though that it in any way suggests that Aspire is gung-ho on ATHX.  The agreement is structured in such a way that Aspire, when forced to do so, will acquire ATHX shares at a very favorable price relative to the market price (you did not include a description of the convoluted wording that determines the price to be paid--Aspire will pay the lesser of at least two different measures which will likely enable them to immediately off-load those shares into the market at a gain).  As for the purchase of 500,000 shares at 2 bucks apiece and a freebie commitment award of 450,000 shares, simple math shows that they received 950,000 shares at a price of $1.05 per share.  I suspect those shares have already been moved to the market (maybe an additional driver of the recent price weakness).  I am also a bit confused over the seemingly protective wording relative to the 'restriction' on short selling by Aspire.  The wording refers to a ""net"" short position being prohibited.  If Aspire in fact does currently hold 3.2 million shares it seems to me that they can easily protect any forced acquisitions by employing a shorting strategy--they have a long way to go to create a net short position.  It is also a little disconcerting that I cannot find any corroboration of the 3.2 million share ownership by Aspire.  Does not show on Yahoo (big wahooo...), not on nasdaq.com, not on WhaleWisdom.com, not anywhere that I can find.  I would appreciate anyone providing a source for such ownership, and, my apologies in advance if someone quickly points me to the right source which is easily discoverable.  Anyhow, I appreciate your analysis and your half-glass-full assessment.  The last time I was presented by a near-full assessment by Gil (think prior to the UC announcement and prior to the initial stroke trial results) I invested heavily in ATHX only to feel that I was seriously misled.  I'm still long the stock and but did protect myself by selling $3 calls within the last year when the share price approached $3--in retrospect (always to do the right thing in retrospect), I should have sold the shares outright.

Thanks  for the comprehensive and concise interpretation . I am a long time large shareholder who strongly believes in the potential of the science. you made no mention of the AMI study.... do you have anything on that front? I am very disappointed in the management for its failure to make periodic updates on anything  and its quarterly conference calls are awful as they allow no questions from shareholders and cut the calls off immediately after the three same folks ask questions each quarter. I am also upset and concerned with the extraordinary salaries and bonuses taken by execs and the failure of any of them to ever buy shares.... even at these prices.,

"Good article !  The results from clinical trials so far point to a high-value commercialization somewhere in next couple years.  For instance, could be that every emergency room and even emergency response unit is carrying an inventory of Multistem as the effectiveness appears to be improved with timeliness of use in that < 36 hour window.  No need to rush into an early partnership before the real value is demonstrable in negotiation and other funding mechanisms are present (as with Aspire).  It's a long haul hold but a high probability payoff for long term investors and lots of shorter term trading opportunities in the current period.  Being a somewhat lazy investor I am long and holding.",

"Re automotive applications, the future is in China and India...massive volumes.  So lets see how BB does as this market takes off.",
"Paulo,i believe the OS automatic reboot is by design. it's just the updated app/program/service repeatedly sends a phony signal to the OS, saying, i am done upgrading, please reboot the OS to take effect the changes. so the OS just did it.a desktop/laptop/handheld can prompt and wait for human input (reboot now or later). but for an embedded device it's usually not a good idea to do that. even so you would still get the prompt once the OS finished rebooting if the updated app sent the signal again.so in this case, it's not an OS defect. they need to fix the stupid app that keeps sending this dumb signal.",

Regarding customers experiencing repeated system rebooting: Uconnect and SiriusXM have implemented a solution. Systems should function normally after receiving the satellite signal and an ignition cycle. Travel Link Service will be restored. We apologize for any inconvenience. http://bit.ly/2BA9Q6k,
That BB market maker is a sob. When the market went red I pulled the trigger for 20K shars of BB @11.94 for a scalp. 11.94 was the ask and the second I put in the order he hit 11.94 to the bid and all I got was an 1100 share fill. Since then it has gone up.,
hi Paulo.  I always liked reading your articles for different perspective just curious what are your top three long positions?  if you don't mind sharing.  I do not have a position in blackberry and I do not short,
"If the Qnx OS boots and reboots randomly, BB should already be in bankruptcy and SP should be  below 1. Rest my case!",
"Here are facts with proof:Now, Fiat Chrysler is using Android 7.0 to support its Uconnect software, taking over the job of designing and maintaining its own custom Android skin, and fully integrating Andriod’s app support and other features on a core level. A working concept of the Android/Uconnect marriage will be on display at CES 2017.......http://bit.ly/2C4iqLD",
"the Verge (Feb 14, 2018)- “Uconnect points the finger at SiriusXM” http://bit.ly/2ocVFvJUConnect Twitter Feed (Feb 15, 2018) - “We have identified that the radio concern is related to SiriusXM Travel Link” http://bit.ly/2HhCsShNewsaged.com (Feb 14, 2018) - “drawback has to do with SiriusXM Travel Link” http://bit.ly/2svgkjZAuthor (Feb 15, 2015) who has been recommending shorting BB since $7 - “This must be a QNX OTA problem.”There has been a minefield of massive competitor issues these last couple of weeks, (iPhone boot sequence exposed http://bit.ly/2BT5Hvf ) (Pixel’s biggest feature, Google Assistant, has to work thru defective microphones & speakers http://bit.ly/2o2vWqd ) and yet this article is about a SiriusXM Travel update issue in some NE states and tries to associate it with BB.GDRP, which is what you should really be worried about, is 100 days away. Does this not concern your “I am short BB” position?",
Another security flaw within Apple's operating system being reported. How often does one read of a BlackBerry issue? Infrequently.,
"Interestingly enough, I think this will give positive news to BB/QNX.Allow me to explain... the ""OTA"" update you neglected to mention came from SiriusXM.  It was an issue with Travel Link and only occurred in the Northeast region of North America, which indicates problems with Sirius' weather satellites service in North East they need to fix.  That's why the fix is simply disabling SiriusXM Travel Link until Sirius can fix their hardware issue.How does this help QNX?  OEMs will be looking for an OS that can handle ALL modules communication.  Right now the QNX is only infotainment (that famous $3-$5 number Chen mentioned).  If an external software (Sirius Travel Link in this case) can reboot the radio module, QNX will be looked on to do MORE than just infotainment.It will open the door for QNX (or other similar OS) to govern the entire vehicle.  Android OS can't just be infotainment now... based on these failures, there is more of a need for these OS to be multi-reaching and communicate with other modules.Thus, this wasn't a black-eye for QNX, but an eye-opener for OEMs that a full vehicle ""backbone"" OS is required.  As you mentioned, QNX is only infotainment software now.  It's not enough, it needs to govern all modules.  That's the future that BB was envisioning with future QNX.If you still don't follow, try this analogy:  Your computer has a media player (QNX), but your latest download of a patch for your e-mail client restarts your computer randomly (Travel Link).  Media player can still play media, but an external force is causing it to reboot.  Solution?  Your operating system can detect failures (blue screen of death for example) and remove software if needed.  In the future, whatever OS any OEM chooses will need to be able to communicate and handle these failures.  It could be BB QNX (future), or Android, or Linux, but it is becoming more apparent now that this type of control is needed.  This is what BB has been talking about for the past year or so with the QNX OS that controls the entire vehicle.  That's why people are bullish on BB.  They saw a few years ago what people are experiencing TODAY.",
"Paulo you aren't a software guy so you can be forgiven for your ignorance _ Kia you claim to be be so I have to believe you should know better.   What we are seeing here is exactly what Blackberry is trying to stop happening in the future with it's QNX hypervisor.   Currently if the infotainment system is told to reboot - it reboots and anything else connected to it is also affected - no fault of the QNX system mentioned above in the Fiat / Chrysler scenario.However what QNX is selling to the automotive companies is the ability for each separate part to run in it's own little sandbox and not affect the others.   So an android based infotainment system could be used and it could reboot as many times as it wants without affecting the QNX based automated driving or vice versa.The point is everyone knows that their is a problem currently and QNX has the solution which is why all the companies you mentioned will still be using QNX in their cars - maybe not for infotainment, but for all critical components, and the infotainment will in all likely-hood be running on a QNX Hypervisor.",
For many years now naysayers have been predicting the impending doom of microsoft. They say similar things: msft is losing customers left and right to mac os. Linux is the next big OS cos its free. There are many free office softwares and msft is doomed. iPad gaming is eating xbox lunch.  Look where the stock price is at today.,

"PauloIf QNX is not going to make money, how is Linux? It sounds like software is dead. Everyone expects superior software for $0.",
"Paul, clearly the company is in transition, and quite likely, the infotainment market is moving away from BB, but why so glum? aren't they growing in other areas and fully aware of the trend? why would you spend so much time beating the company about the face over a shrinking market that the company is defending itself against? http://bit.ly/2BuiV0a",

"Yet another article suggesting the sky is falling for QNX. And yet revenue in BB's Technology Services sector has held steady per quarter in year-over-year terms. Revenue for the first three quarters of 2018 was $36m, $38m, and $43m, following the same pattern we saw in 2017. At worst you could argue that losses in the infotainment sector are being made up by sales gains from other QNX-based offerings, or perhaps even from Radar, although making that point would then spoil the argument that Radar is flaming out. Seriously, though, when will all of the ""massive losses"" in QNX that we've been hearing about for the past 2 years start showing up on the balance sheet?  One thing for certain is that it's disingenuous to link losses in overall BB revenue to losses in Software and Services, as in lines like, ""Blackberry in overall terms remains a company that’s getting smaller, not larger."" Yes, revenue from Service Access Fees and from handset sales still has about $35m to go before it disappears forever. In Software & Services, however, revenue has grown from (GAAP) $248m in FY2014 to a run-rate of $764m by Q3/18. About half of that has been organic, and half through acquisitions.",

"So let me try to understand this. Apple hires Dan Doge, the founder of QNX, to run its car division and this is a huge win. I assume Dodge was hired because of his history with QNX. But, QNX is a dud. So, by logical extension, the Apple car program is a failure. Or, maybe QNX isn’t a dud. Am I missing something?",

"Lighten up  buddy: This is not a real issue, seen it first hand. But I get it, and thank you for the report. The fact is this ""infotainment space"" is the main in out, it is the server.

Go Harmony....,
"""We are still optimistic on the miner and think that it's a great way to own gold. ""I don't understand this sentence. This is a mining company, not a direct gold investment. They happen to mine gold, but if they sell their gold at a fixed price based on hedges, exactly how do they benefit from a change in the gold price? In particular, you noted that they sold a fair amount of gold at higher than spot price because they hedged it, but as the hedges come off, they will need to sell gold at lower prices, since spot is well below the hedged value you quoted. Seems to me that the profit of Harmony is only loosely connected to the current price of gold, due to the complex nature of their hedges, forward selling, swaps, or whatever they are doing to hedge their pricing. Maybe the author can explain a bit more about exactly how Harmony hedges, and how the spot price of gold impacts their profitability going forward.",

A point to consider:Nabriva conducted a study to measure lefamulin concentration in pulmonary epithelial cells and found the concentration there was ~5.7X that of the plasma concentration. It appears that pulmonary excretion might be a secondary elimination pathway. That could help to counteract the lower plasma concentration observed for the oral formulations.J Antimicrob Chemother 2016; 71: 1022–1026doi:10.1093/jac/dkv442 Advance Access publication 7 January 2016,Just How Risky Is Nabriva's Final Trial?
