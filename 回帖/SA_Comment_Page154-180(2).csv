"SE: Nice article and excellent trading . Though our approaches are totally different , I commend you on skilfully trading the stock on the short side I never sold a share as I purchased a large position in 1998-99 and have a split adjusted cost basis of $2.48 per share. I was always jabbing at your work , mostly out of frustration. That said, the Capital Gains Tax was horrific for me . GILD is still an Iconic name in the History of Biotechnology. I give Kudos to the two Johns as they changed a death sentence, AIDS into a chronic managed Disease and cured Hep C. Not bad from an innovative Humanistic POV. They also spun off close to $60B in free cash flow , and by what every long holder thought  was “stupid” by buying back shares. Guess how they got their Market Cap back up to ~$100B ? I believe the new Board Members as well as the existing Directors fired the two Johns because it finally hit them that to be a Large Cap  Biotech Co they needed to go from a small culture mentality to a large culture mentality, and put growth back into the equation. Neither John was willing to play that game. The stock will be back up to where even you guys will become longs.",
"I disagree with SE. Things may be finally getting interesting. Merger, filgotinib, selonsertib are the things that are going to move GILD appreciatively going forward. The old guard is gone, making the possibility of a buyout/merger more likely. Should be getting read outs on the new drugs in the coming months. HCV cloud is lifting. Still have all that cash (32 billion) on the balance sheet - what will they do? I believe patience will soon be rewarded. Adding to my position cautiously. Buckle up!",
Being short ABBV is a mistake ....,

"SE you are RIGHT.. THIS IS BOTTOM for GILD SP - but TELL US ""Exactly"" WHY?The point is, the 4 TAF drugs are growing quarter to quarter - and accounted for the $500 Million dollar jump in Q2 2018 revenues from $5.1B to $5.65B. These 4 TAF drugs have been increasing since their introduction years ago - by similar amounts every Quarter. AND … will add another $400 MILLION to Q3 2018 revenues for close to $6B total. No one is seeing this (or mentioning where the $500M increase came from in Q2 2018). Add in old Truvada (which is jumping by $100M+ a quarter) and you got GROWTH again ... a BOOMer in 2018. Descovy (+$44M) Odefsey (+40M) Genvoya (+80M) (to $1.16B - more than all HCV). Biktarvy (+150M) just ramping up. I see total $350M in Q3 2108 Biktarvy will start eating into Genvoya sales - they say - but it hasn't happened yet - or Genvoya is still growing on it's own account. Truvada (+150 in USA only Q2 2018) TOTAL - $464M.I RATE GILD A BUY.",
"Applause, applause, SE! If you decide to close this chapter of the GILD drama, I guess we've seen the bottom already.As an SA analyst covering GILD, did you actually change the theme of GILD assessment a quarter earlier and quit your short position accordingly? You could have had come out $10/share  richer than doing so just recently.

How could you rate it a hold and at the same time short the stock? The two actions are at odds with each other.,
I think the departures are a chance for a clean slate. Good for Gilead to transition now. I think it's overly optimistic to hope for a mega merger with another pharma company.,

Is their anyway to figure how much market coverage is for Google and Apple pay? Over the period of time I believe Apple Pay and Google Pay will win big time.

How to buy the hottest chip stock this year for nothingvideo.cnbc.com/...,
"AMD's risk, IMHO, is that it has two 200lb gorillas in its two main areas. In chips, it has to compete with Intel, and although AMD fans constantly predict Intel will die it hasn't and it keeps growing. Its new 8 core 14nm i9 chips, selling at about $400, will do well next year unless AMD's planned 7nm release later this year blows them away (and AMD's prior lower-nm releases NEVER blew Intel away and performed worse in gaming). In video cards, it has to compete with NVDA which is a similar market (as in consumer) favorite.I'm not saying it'll go down, but I wouldn't blame an AMD owner for cashing in on their 91% 2018 windfall.

"AMD is not a stock that paper analysts are going to know how to profit from.  AMD's old charts, old fundamentals, and last 5 years information are pretty much unusable for understanding AMD..On the other side, people with that currently work in technology, use/work with these technologies daily, and that can see first hand the changes going on around the world, these people can easily observe the huge opportunity with AMD.AMD stock was totally mutilated over the last 5 years, since Intel tried to kill AMD over the last 5 years while AMD was building its new cpu, gpu, apu, and infinity fabric architectures and products..Intel failed, had to pay AMD several billion dollars, and AMD has released now very successful first generations products that match and/or exceed Intel's, and AMD will release their second more powerful 7 nm products starting this year.AMD is a company that knows how to scale production and products, and CEO Lisa Su continues to be underestimated.. She is already years ahead of Intel plans and archtiectures, and now is becoming obvious that Intel is behind several years..That Intel has incoming chips that that are 300 GHz faster on one core or so, is immaterial if the price of the product is double the AMD products and are on very limited production because they are the best performing chip bins/picksIntel is failing because it failed to obtain a high-end GPU (Project Larrabee, etc), it failed to obtain a high-end computing processor(PHI), failed with supporting Apple needs (5G, etc), and Intel is the only company without HSA APU native architecture..  Intel's EMIB process is just a silicon process not a HSA processor architecture.AMD has 3 foundries ready to supply high-yield and high-end products to AMD..Intel lacks a similar architecture and product like AMD's Infinity Fabric, which means Intel is forced to continue to build old monolithic and unprofitable chips, so AMD at half the price of Intels, AMD will profit immensely.. Even more since AMD has several much faster chips than Intel, and Intel will not have any high-core count products in several years.. since it lacks the Infinity Fabric similar architecture. It will take years for Intel to catch AMD with an HSA APU and Infinity Fabric architecture and products.. AMD can easily scale in cores and performance at the right price.. Intel have been charging 2x to 8x customers for their products, and customers are not heppy about that, and now they have a much better choice and even better performance.AMD at $19, it still has 10x+ to go.. AMD since 2016 ($1.80) has provided 1000% in stock profits..  and since AMD 12 year old just CPU stock value was $42, AMD has a lot of room to go 4x very fast.. AMD went from $11 to $42 in 8 months back on 2006, where it was just a cpu company. Now AMD is cpu, gpu, apu, and infinity fabric company with a huge product portfolio and even with a 7 nm chip fabrication advantage..",

"@Sighcopath ,On the same page with you here; however, if DOW drops to 21-22K then AMD would get to 12-13 range and I think it is time for accumulation of AMD.  For protection I also bought INTC puts @50 and FB puts @172 ...who know how the market behaves in next 4 months.",
"Great article!!  Disclaimer Long AMD.  Having purchased put protection for my ""Core"" AMD stock with speculative calls sold at profits, additional speculative shares that were long I would make a hell of a lot more money on AMD right now if it dropped from $19 too $10 than i will if it rises from $19 too $30.  Own put protection at $12, $14.50, $15 and $18 along with $20 calls.In November of last year I took half my speculative profits from AMD and created my core holding with the belief that AMD would be at $200 by 2025.  The core position will not even be used to write covered calls.  The additional stock I purchased going into 2Q18 ER is why I have double protection at $14.50.  My target price of $20 was reached 5 months early!  Expecting AMD to drop back to the $15.50-$16.80 area as we approach NVDA ER and the expected rumors of a new GPU from NVDA.  My EoY target is $25-$30 for AMD but too much uncertainty about hyper scale customer adaptation of EPYC servers needs to be clarified, which should happen in the next 3 months.  IMHO Crypto and even GPU market in general are a distraction too the new AMD CPU company.  AMD current single socket EPYC servers are faster and more efficient than  INTC double socket servers!  Hyper scale customers must be negotiating from a perceived position of strength and trying to low ball AMD on price.  Why else would Dr. Su have said at conference call (paraphrased) ""AMD is not going to announce new customer adaptation of EPYC servers we will let the customers make the announcements"".  In Sighcopathic speak that translates into ""You will pay our price or keep buying slow, hot and specter susceptible CPU.  AMD is doing just fine with new product ramps and development and there are other customers out there.""  At least that is what i think was said in CEO speak!3QER guidance lower than expected.  One really big reason could be that SoC revenue from consoles will be much lower than previous years with the normally expected decrease as the boxes age.  Second Accounting changes from 606 make comparing last years data with this years problematic as revenue has to be spread out more evenly.  Third AMD is transitioning from a low cost alternative to OEM to a high end supplier of cutting edge technology.  If AMD current EPYC servers are so much better does it make sense to waste these wafers on lower margin chips or sell less chips at much higher margins?  If I listened correctly AMD said they are on track for full year guidance which tells me that any drop in Q3 might be intentional as AMD stock piles high margin chips for Q4 sales.  Finally AMD is starting to make a presence in laptop and notebook markets in the last few months.  Wait to see if AMD can actually create a 5-10% market share in laptops and notebooks along with a 15-20% server market.Would make a hell of a lot more money in AMD dropped to 10 in 6 months than I  would if it rises to $30 but IMHO I'll never cash a single core put protection unless the general market implodes and the DOW drops to 21K-22K.On a side note while researching AMD and trying to see into the stock action for the next 6 weeks I looked at INTC.  As I looked it suddenly occurred to me that INTC was acting very similar to GE a year ago.  Had to take a chunk of my AMD speculative position money and buy $46 puts on INTC.  Way to many things at INTC look just like GE problems a year ago!  BTW been shorting GE with puts since it was at $24 and still own GE in the money puts.",
"25 price target for 2019?  So then you think 7nm sales will be very small, basically the same as current sales plus a little bit of growth.If they were competing with Intel 10nm which was not delayed 18 months to 2020 for icelake then yes would make sense, but given the delay we have to expect growth to be much larger.",

You cannot be successful in your investing career and be constantly swayed by changing opinions of outsiders. Is's very important to believe in yourself and trust your judgement. Quote of Warren Buffett,
"Well I see my comments are being read and used in some articles! And yes Smatt is very Smart :) My comment that noted AMD should not be trading under $10 and should be north of $16 definitely was my comment and I stick to that but after this earnings release and recent events I’m going to update my PT as well. With Intel’s delays, NVDA as well, crypto trading much higher, AMD EPYC being adopted throughout the world, Ryzen the technology taking over the computer world, BALANCE sheet so much stronger, China tariffs don’t affect AMD like other chip companies and not to mention tariffs are being negotiated and will come to an end soon, and to put the cherry on top their Margins are growing!! AMD should be trading north of $18 and PT of at least $27. The 2nd half will have mass production all around with EPYC being adopted on a full scale! AMD stock price is catching up to a decade old trading range. It’s now time to even possibly going back to their ultimate high of $40. This can and will happen when other companies fail to keep up with AMDs 7nm! This recent sale of stock by one of AMDs biggest shareholders is done and gone and he always sells his shares. This is a good thing. AMD does NOT need his financial support anymore. He sold and still owns a ton of shares! Not a reason to sell!",
AMD is going to run lower between now and Q3 earnings. Plan on it. I liquidated all my short term calls. But I think the 2019s are good for a move to $25 and the 2020s are good for $35+. Maybe $45. I don’t agree with TV and WOF. I believe AMD is going to crush Intel first half of 2019. CRUSH.,

""AMD is considering Zero Crypto revenue for Q3 2018. Volatility will be there in revenue because of Back to school. Semi Custom is lower. My guess is crypto revenue will not be zero. Back to School will provide additional revenue. Semi Custom will remain lower. EPYC revenue will be similar to Q2 2018. So we can expect revenue of >$1725mThere will be few Mega Data Center customer announced just before Q4 2018. My guess is one of them is Drop Box, another one will be one of the following Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba. EPYC revenue for Q42018 will be around $350m. This will make Q4 revenue above $1750m.All this means the total 2018 revenue will be at minimum $6880m , a growth of 31% YoY. EPS will be 25c + 16c + 18c = 59c. If we can get above numbers then there is nothing to be negative here (I was epecting more revenue earlier but I have revised the revenue / eps lower). AMD stock price will end 2018 at around $25. In the meantime I am writing either weekly or monthly calls depending in how risky the environment is to be called. We also need to consider 2019 when AMD will have superior process node than Intel.

"Management is the main problem. In Florida they are not wanting to expand as new subdivisions are being built (no interest at all - it cost money). They don't even fix damaged cables and allow businesses to be without service for weeks and management doesn't care.

They don't know and don't care. How do you expect to keep customers when you don't spend money? The old GTE was the company, but that was before modern technology. Sure things have change, but if you don't want to lose any more customers to have to have them want to stay. Why do customers want to stay? Can't find anywhere else to go to? Well, as the older population fades away, and the new younger tech savvy customer finds out they don't need or want a land line, interent, or TV over wire or fiber. They will use free Wi-Fi hot spots to do what they need to do, that is non secure and then for their secure needs they will use their unlimited data plan. So yes why would Frontier be concerned about expanding land line or even fiber? The cost for fiber is such that you have to have LARGE subdivisons accept the placement and possible have a Home Owners Association accept Frontier as the only provider of phone, internet and TV service.

"This article was worthless.  The reality is that the company’s results were roughly inline with expectations and they reaffirmed guidance on an improved back half which is not a stretch. They also announced a new $500 million cost cutting program which is huge. Obviously that will entail some upfront costs and all the $500 mm will not drop to the bottom line but if just half of it does and it’s worth 5x that’s $1.25 billion of EV. Assuming they have to spend $500mm to implement it. Then it is $750 of value creation worth about $7 on the stock. The stock has fallen 40% since the q1 print, expectations obviously should have been low. The stock should trade to $6 or $7 not back below $5",

The only artificial intelligence in play there is senior leadership. Customer service is terrible, there are morale problems, and employees are fleeing the C portion of the CTF acquisition. All top-talent leaving. Many properties sold off across CTF--and then leased back at high-rates on long-term contracts. Product set: stone-age...25Mb/s is super-slow when Spectrum and other providers offer 1G speed. Frontier is CAF-Roping to stay afloat. Bain--consulting firm--same firm that 'guided' FTR during acquisition....but they are ""really good"" per today's call per FTR's CEO. How does a CEO stay in place when he takes company from $5B down to less than $400M in just over 2 years? Frontier should have taken the $10B and purchased Avaya and potentially another 'cloud' VoIP provider, and then upgraded its network...so much $$$ w/such poor planning and lack of due diligence.",
"Replace the CEO. Revenue was in line but loss was greater. FTR needs a rigid cost management structure that meets or beats the plan. I ask what we do as individuals to contain our cost of living.IF IT IS AN UN-NECESSARY ITEM AND YOU CANT REALLY AFFORD IT, DONT SPEND THE MONEY.",

They offer nothing of any meaning or real value to an acquirer.  Managing margin and revenue decline for telcos is no longer a sustainable business model.  Recall Fairpoint 5 years ago....they are re-orged twice since then and headed back again.

I see no reason for FTR to stay at this stock for any length of time FCF is more than sufficient and CAPEX expenditures are more than adequate to sustain growth and transition to 5G.

I have owned ""V"" since its IPO in 2008 and I have never seen such ongoing bitching and wining by these merchants about credit card fees. As I assume you know ""V"" just set aside $600 Million Dollars for settling some ongoing litigation.  Now this pops up from Kroeger.  I do think that both ""V"" and ""MA"" are going to have to figure out a solution of some kind with this continual attack from all these merchants.  Maybe they will have to be proactive or this will go on and on into perpetuity.   Think back as to how many years all this crap has been going on.  Way too many.",

"Fabien HugIn my experience ALWAYS cheaper elsewhere for identical product. If this is so then that segment will never be profitable and no room to reduce cost below competitors because they are already losing money.. AWS growing but losing market share to Azure and Azure makes huge profit margins and AWS does not. So what if AMZN has all these business extensions and interactions if they are all losing money and per CEO, no plans to monetize them. With a PE around 220, they need about 800% increase in cash flow to get to PE around 25, and AAPL would still be a better value play even without any increase in AAPL revenue or profits. But read AAPL quarterly report. Lots happening, growth in every segment and this quarter had no new IPhones. Next quarter 3! And we know there are things to come in AI, VR and medical monitoring. Guaranteed each will be profitable from the get go. Services segment alone would make it a fortune 300 company. AWS is losing market share to Azure because Azure has a better enterprise product. For AWs to regain that scale of growth they would have to improve the product and reduce cost. Then poof goes all the AMZN profit. Soon folks will realize the AMZN Emperor has no clothes.

The $5 billion shares repurchasing program does not seem to help this stock.  It has lost 16% since earnings.  What gives?,
"The negative sentiment on storage stocks, MU WDC STX, is due to the transition from client storage to cloud storage. As client storage goes down b/c we end users don’t need to buy large amount of memory when we have cloud subscription, cloud capacity only slowly picks up the slack. OTH enterprise storage carries price premium. This negative sentiment will take time to dissipate.",

"Why does WDC command such a high PE compared to MU, which is the clear leader?",
"Yeah, right. Wdc is a joke.",
"I agree with your points.  I believe you can expand the basket of stocks and reduce your risk.  I have been adding a basket of STX, WDC, MU, NXPI, INTC, AMAT and LRCX.  At first this is looks like a disparate group of tech stocks.  You have HDD/SSD, SSD/HDD, DRAM/NAND, OEM Chips, 800 pound gorilla, and two semiconductor equipment manufacturers, respectively.  You could also add KLAC to this group (I sold this a month ago).  The reason I put these into a basket is that they are expected to have a short-term pullback in revenue (each has said that either the June or September quarter will be their lull/bottom or NXPI which has had headwinds from now dead merger with QCOM), but is subject to significant long-term growth.  The short-term pull back is more than compensated for with the low P/E's ranging from 5 to 15.  Each of these companies is generating huge cash flow and increasing their capital allocation to shareholders.So I am not disagreeing with the article, just suggesting expanding the basket to reduce risk.  In technology, there is always the risk of a misstep.  Obviously others may suggest other stocks to add - which is welcome.",

anyone have thoughts on Google Pixel watch adding to the competition later this year in the smart watch category?,
Down almost 8% this morning.  So much for that slight post market increase yesterday.,
way below analysts expectations. Although fitbit met the quarter guidance.  . Request @Asymmetric Investing  to come back with follow up analysis after the results - why  could not FITBIT make killer revenues  if versa feedback was so successful . I personally find analyst did not focus on right area by questioning management about opex. They shoudl be behind new revenue streams and how much twine contributes to overall revenue.,
"I think it's a combination of weak tracker sales and supply constraints on Versa, which invalidated the author's demand-centric analysis. Nonetheless, supply issues typically are ironed out fairly soon, so I think some of the arguments here are pushed out vs being wrong.",
Totally missed top line. Trackers tanked so so bad - $124m in 2Q vs $174m in 1Q. And 1Q is annually the worst quarter of the year. That $50m decrease made all the difference - big beat turned into barely beat. Ugh.,
Fitit has barely managed to meet  Q2 expectations . forget beating the revenue forecast. is vers sales not upto the expectations. I hope the author comes back  with post results analysis too.,
dead money. time for folks to move on to a good investment.,
I guess here is the problem I have with their report (besides not beating expectations by a larger amount).  They issue a statement that the Versa is outselling all competitors combined (minus Apple).  During the quarter they issued a statement about the Versa being the fastest selling device ever.  They also issue a statement that the Versa sold out.  If all of this is true then why aren't the estimates for next quarter going through the roof?  They are either sandbagging next quarter's numbers or the Versa has completely cannibalized Ionic smartwatch and fitness tracker sales.  Unfortunately it may be the latter.,
They need to get this supposed spo2 sensor activated. Make it availabe to only people who purchase fitbit coach.,
"Exactly as expected, like I said above too many were expecting a huge beat, may forecast in my previous comments months ago was for  300 million revenue, between 280 and 320. Accordingly even the rally is not so big as anticipated by many.",
"I think we were all hoping for more out of the report. The beat was so small given the already extremely low guidance. And forward guidance was dismal in that it went unchanged, either a sign of very high tracker cannibalism with the SW or sand bagging guidance, neither of which are good things.",
Wow!  Earnings out now and I have to say I am disappointed.  Revenue fell way short than what I expected.  Guidance for next quarter and the year is basically in line with expectations.  Stock up slightly in AH trading but gains may fade tomorrow.,
"Must have missed something on the top line coming in so much lower than the projections we had.  Q3 guidance was up a very small amount, full year unchanged.  Kind of a blah report.  Par for the course at these prices.",
Great article! Gopro once beat guidance but revised down the guidance for the following quarters. The stock fell a lot. Hopefully this will not happen fitbit.,

I think it’ll be an uphill challenge to 3x the marketcap selling through 3P channels like Amazon.,

"Everybody is bullish on Fitbit right now, everybody is expecting a beat. For this reason, I am not expecting a huge rally after the ER, but a rally is possible.",
"My thoughts- James Park has killed great ER reports before during his conference call. There were “several beat and guide down” reports in the last 2 years and it never fared well.I have a few Jan 2019 calls, for many of the same reasons as everyone else: it’s a hated stock and *IF* it has a perfect ER today then it’s poised to pop. That being said, I’ve been burned by Mr. Park’s calls and fully am aware that that’s a likely possibility again.",
What about guidance? Is that addressed above? I skimmed the article quickly but we all know rarely do companies simply trade on results it's more so on guidance.My concern is reading some people writing that some of the watches are on back order.If this is widespread that is not good. The current Q3 revenue estimate is north of $377M.As a what if example a beat and in-line guide will likely result in a muted response or perhaps slightly positive depending on the call.A beat and a guide down would not be good at all.Thoughts?Thank you.,
"Thanks for the good article.I tend to think you are correct and Fitbit will beat both revenue and earnings estimates and guide higher for next quarter.  All good recipe for a higher stock price.  My concern is that the stock does not react as expected.  It almost seems too easy, how can anyone who spends a little time analyzing the stock not come to the same conclusion about a blowout quarter?  And yet the stock price has dropped significantly leading to this earnings report.  What are we missing?  Will there be an impact due to currency exchange?  Will the gross margins drop enough to upset Wall St. and cause the reverse reaction?  I want to take a large position but a little worried that market has a surprise reaction.  I have held MU through great earnings reports only to see the stock drop 5% to 7% the next day.  Don't want to get burned again.Good luck to all longs tomorrow!",
Enjoyed thank you very much,
May have a lot of weak hands who bought after Citron got everyone amped up and then we had that BS tariff story to flush all of those people out.  That may explain the odd weakness lately.  I’m talking up my own book here but that’s how I see it.,
I also ran the numbers back when he said they sold 1 million and any way you slice it it seems tough to imagine them coming in under the mid 300s top line.  Add to that the Morgan Stanley downgrade the stock blew off and the awful Q4/Q1 the stock also blew off.  It’s poised and everyone is sleeping.  You’re the first person to lay it out the same way I have been looking at it.  Other articles are looking at software and all this other BS that may or may not come true.

"I have similar big beat projections:1Q:30% of sales revenue (not number of devices) was smart watches. That’s $74m. I plug in 275k Ionics at sp of $195 and 140k Versa’s (pre ship) at sp of $145 to equal $74m. That leaves 1.78m device sales plus service revenue and accessory revenue for $174m in revenue.2Q:Usually 2Q is higher than 1Q, but even if you assume a legacy products QoQ 20% decrease of $174 to $140m, assume Ionic unit sales decrease to 250k at $180 sp, assume 200k Ace sales at sp of $70 and assume ONLY 1m Versa’s at $145, you get $344m in 2Q revenues.The above is so conservative imo that I think it could easily be well over $400m. And if the sales beat is this significant, seems impossible that forward guidance isn’t either maintained or increased.I must admit I am confused by this recent drop in share price. It’s been unnerving. But the above math seems so easy.",

Cramer admitted today that Micron is the most undervalued stock on the S&P 500 with a P/E of 4,
"PB11, I'll give some input, but I am not actually an expert.  Others can chime in.Contract generally lags spot as they are generally 1-3 month contracts, so contract lags as they locked price in some time before.  if spot is rising, contract is generally lagging and lower.   When spot is falling, contract again lags and then contract is generally higher or equal.  Contract is generally under spot.   Note that contract is better for seller in most cases.  Say MU sells a good volume to Google on 3 month contract.  Why is it better for MU?  They have firm demand with strong buyer.  Cost per bit is always declining (not significant over 3 months, but still going down).   Lastly, ideally MU love to have large %, like 60-80% under contract.  That way they have clear demand and don't have to run around selling/pitching.   Then they can get last 20-40% at spot or premium because they are running out of bits (aka easier to sell/run/manage the business and better pricing).  Lastly, they can easily/fully fulfill contract even if they have a manufacturing issue.   That is what they have been in the last year, but with contract softening, many are now calling for the doom (big drop).",
"Can anyone with industry expertise explain to me if how contract prices & spot prices can differ when there is over/undersupply?  i.e. MU keeps explaining that their ASP's are rising, whereas DramXchange continues to show weakness.  With an undersupply of DRAM, are contract prices rising for large orders because of the lack of availability, whereas the spot prices are decreasing for smaller orders?  Just curious...",
"They are switching to capital purchases because they see prices of NAND and DRAM trending south temporarily. It makes economic sense since the stock will follow and they can pick it up cheaper than they can the debt. Trend should be flat or down for some time. Price goes down, they will buy more. Price goes up, they will let it float down again. Not rocket science. Long-term this is a super value stock, but I wouldn't expect any jump for a while.

Okay I am probably dreaming, time to wake up...",
Micron fire sale this early morning.  Down as low as $51.38. Looks like at least some buyers are taking advantage. $52.17 right now 30 minutes into trading day.The pattern has to been to sell of the entire day after the initial morning bump.  But has Micron found a bottom on overdone FUD?  Could today be different? We'll see.I mean do people realize it may make 25% of the value of the stock in the next year?  The danger and hit due to trade issues is overblown for several reasons.  But has anyone considered what will happen if nothing happens to Micron.  There is danger both ways folks.  Melt up I think is more probable than melt down.,
"This article fails to mention current excessive ASP of DRAM and new capacity investments of their top competitors, driving down the current oversupplied market into a more stable demand/supply market with lower ASP. Samsung will dictate the new lower prices. Micron will follow and margins will go down in the coming quarters. The bull quarters are over.Author mentions all these hot exciting trends, what is the competitive advantage for Micron? With what will they outperform the market since they produce commodity goods?",
"Remarkably within just two quarters Micron will have the same balance sheet strength as Apple and Google, assuming trading conditions revert to Q2/Q3 2018 conditions when they earned $2.82 - $3.15 per share and $2.2bn of free cashflow a quarter.Gross debt will be down at least another $2bn this quarter (end Aug) to around $5bn, and net debt a NEGATIVE $2.6bn, meaning net cash will already amount to 4.2% of market capitalisation.Assuming no share buyback, and reversion to Q2/Q3 2018 trading conditions, net cash would reach at least $7bn by end Q2 2019 (Feb) equals to 11.5% of market cap - comparable to Apple and Google.",
Thank you for another well thought-out article. We all know Micron is massively undervalued. The question is when will it finally go up and stay up. I'm tired of Micron acting so skittish on every minor bad news out there. I thought it would at least stay at PE of 8. So much lost opportunities this year investing in Micron and I might finally jump ship if this thing doesn't move soon.,
China Syndrome is causing massive weakness in memory sector but it will recover soon. At the time the market is in cleansing process to shake out weak longs to sell before it takes off. Micron had behaved this way for last few years when it came back from the dead and this time is no different.I forgot to say this is a good article and Micron is a buy and hold here.,

"Patience will be rewarded for MU investors.  Anyone who looks at the 1-day, 1-week or 1-month charts of the company are making amateur investing mistakes.  95% of investors do not understand the DRAM or NAND industries, how the products are different from one another, and just how early we are in the upcoming memory surge.  It's been said time & time again, 5G, IoT, autonomous vehicles, datacenters, exponential data analysis, etc will all help drive the memory surge that we are currently a part of.  The Big 3 cannot even keep up with DRAM demand today, just wait when 5G is out of its infancy and in full swing.MU has positioned itself to thrive over the next 5-10 years, and they have proven quarter after quarter that their degree of confidence in their guidance is extremely high.  They are starting to package their products which takes the cyclicality out of their business entirely.  I can go on & on about just how sweet of a spot this company is in, but many traders will still complain about how the share price has not risen to $70 or $80 over the last 3-5 months.Investing takes patience.  MU will be a solid investment.  Good luck all.",

Their 1 year allotment allows for over 16% of the outstanding shares at the current price.  MU rightly believes that paying off the debt, completing their R&D and Capex is well handled by the current cash flows.  They are committed to rewarding their shareholders (believe you me, this is something you really want in a management team).  So if the price doesn't start climbing through the last four months of the year, when we get to next year and the cash flows are as good or better than this year which ends soon.  They will just commit to more share repurchases.  The idea is to get the price to a fair level.  Once that happens, they will start paying dividends.",

"Enjoyed the Author’s article and he lays out a great narrative for Long term ownership of MU. I think what confounds most folks (including me) is that all of the fundamentals that the Author lays out are known by everybody. It seems also that MU Management has “Pre announced” earnings for 2 quarters in a row as well as a 10 Billion DollarBuyback. During this time frame MU has not been able to hold its’ post announcements share prices. Maybe MU Management should go back to its’ regularly scheduled Earnings Reports (not early) and also not announce Buybacks until they are prepared to start them immediately (like QCOM). MU, and therefore MU Management, is not getting the respect they deserve from these Early announcements so I would suggest they go back to Standard Operating Procedures that are more widely accepted by folks.Wishing Well To The Author And MU Shareholders!",
"@Author,You have listed 4 reasons why  MU perform poorly and you think within 1 year, it will be $90+   Are you expecting those 4 reasons will be disappeared? I think the main reason to keep MU at low $50+ is the IP litigation.   I am guessing that MU may use UMC's patents to manufacture the DRAM module.   MU, even has rich IP on chip design, probably neglected the module business back then.  MU's main DRAM module business is from Taiwan's Inortera, a Taiwanese company, located very near to UMC.   I will not be surprised that  some engineers work for both of the companies, and might just use the patents without notice.     Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to defend UMC.  In fact, I think if MU can move forward by paying the penalty or reach agreement with UMC, if they really use the patents, the stock price will then go up significantly.  Right now, I see most of people are accusing UMC the theft ( I agree, and they are strong evidence), but using the patent is different thing.We all want MU to go much higher, but I can't see there is any good suggestion.

On the other hand anyone who was thinking wrong about Nvidia and kept his shares, is extremely happy now. The thing is that the world needs more and more CPUs and GPUs every year. ARM CPUs are still far behind and the GPU market is well guarded from any external invaders. Even if AMD wasn't going to increase it's market share, it would still keep making more money every year.

"So AMD had an awesome quarter and earned a profit of 0.71%.  I can only think that these new AMD investors see that Intel is stagnating and are looking for the next big semi.  They see AMD as being the big gainer this year (ignoring the bubble burst that had them start the year low), and so they go with AMD.  I think NVidia's new gaming graphics cards should give AMD longs a chill up their spines.  Q3 and Q4 are traditionally NVidia's big quarters, not Q1 and Q2.  Looking at NVDA dropping now is missing that NVDA will either regain that lost group over the quarter, or be a great candidate for Calls before earnings.  Meanwhile, AMD will be hard pressed to repeat that profit, especially as the share price advances.  And even if AMD manages to do so, this is still likely to be the pinnacle of their achievements during fat times.I honestly like AMD as a company, but not as an investment.  I will say that I would rather own AMD long into the future than Intel though, and I think that Intel investors are coming to AMD as they become Intel bears.  As AMD has increased from April/May 2018, so too has Intel has decreased from April/May 2018.Apologies to any AMD long that doesn't want to see a bearish post on their forums that is bullish on NVidia, but I felt my thoughts would be appropriate to this article.I am considering going short AMD as well prior to AMD earnings.

However, since AMD is on the up and up, I think a more sound strategy is to buy the dip and double down rather than any kind of shorting by timing the peak. Imo 18.30s is a good entry point if it comes around again. I would only possibly want to short AMD in the near term is if it goes to 20 again on weak news and I mean conservatively by selling calls for shares owned... and not buying puts.  AMD is just too hot and the trend is up not down. Staying with technical facts like 7nm vs 14nm or MCM vs monolithic is much clear cut outlook for a long bet. Short-term strategy is risky. It is easily right one day and wrong next.  The worst feeling has to be being right and still lose money (like you know long is good, but u ""gamble"" on short and lose).",

In addition to the things that Akram mentioned, which is mainly that AMD high-end gaming revenues are small and that CPU prospects are what is driving the stock, here is another huge reason I think the thesis is wrong: To the extent AMD story is about GPUs (and I think it is a little bit), it is about AMD's progress in AI/ML.  AMD management is not even talking about much about gaming. The narrative is how AI/ML sales are increasing rapidly. That does not change with anything Nvidia is going to introduce. I can say with near certainty that AMD AI/ML GPU revenues are going to increase smartly every quarter from now on for several quarter to come. Effectively, what I am saying is that very few people see AMD as a high end gaming play so I do not see how Austin's thesis has any legs.",

"If I may...my thoughts on Lisa's guidance for 18Q3 (and in effect for 18Q4)...Summary of my thesis...Lisa is just projecting out the remainder of the year's guidance based on her previous ""high mid-twenties revenue growth for 2018"", which I recollect she stated in 18Q1 and reinforced in 18Q2 CC. '17YE Revenue (A)...$5.33byn, let's call high mid-20's...28% growth for '18YE.  That would put 2018 at $6.82byn. To date (1st H18, she has in $1.65b + $1.76b or $3.41b, leaving another $3.41b for the remainder of the year. So, in the Q2 CC she projects $1.70b for Q3 and (infers) $1.71b for Q4. To justify her assumptions, she tells the masses she doesn't expect much from crypto or Epyc over next two Q's. She can make these projections on July 25th after sampling July's revenue numbers. But she really doesn't know what pleasant surprises are in store over the next 5 months. If crypto reverses or Epyc validation occurs more rapidly than expected, she'll happily revise her projections. The masses get the 'company line', but some WS people get the 'whispers'. How can I say that?  Look at the upward revisions to TP's from some of the more friendly analysts. Would they really go so far out on that limb without a safety net...?  JA'?",

"Austin, What will you do if AMD demonstrates 7nm Navi (against his wishes)  because she wanted to pull Navi to the left, starting with PS5.  This has already been done and a Gammers 7nm Navi is now sampling.Navi will avail itself of RyZen IP and break up the GPU.  It will not suffer the fate of Vega.So IF AMD has a Gammer Navi demo at SIGGraph you have your answer to “where’s the AMD response?”  Will you have Cognitive bias?",

"This is going to be a case of being right for the wrong reasons or wrong for the wrong reasons.Nvidia's share in the ultra-high end gaming gpu market is literally 95%+. If you are willing to spend over $450 for a gaming card you are not remotely considering vega. You go buy a 1080 or 1080ti. It's literally no comparison, and I know cause i looked closely when i bought a new 1080ti recently.So, either the stock falls for other reasons and you make money. Or nvidia's announcement underwhelms and you have people buy amd on that news because nvda market share has nowhere to go but down if anything goes wrong. But Nvidia being the hype machine that it is, I doubt they get a perceived disappoint with their launch. Point is though their new cards are only competing against their pascal line up, and that's where things are more interesting. God knows what asp they are aiming for here, and whether there is a game out there that a 1080 or 1080ti isn't more than enough for these days. The performance specs on these cards will be sharply scrutnized by gaming community as far as value goes. A better question is how enabled will these cards be for ai workloads, and whether that market gobbles these up instead. I'm guessing nvda has thought that through considering what they selling tesla v100's for, but who knows.",

"@embr,""At some point the market will wake up to that and these kind of short-term plays will no longer work.""Probably, but my thinking is somewhat similar to Austin's. There is a tremendously huge brand gap between AMD and Intel (though Intel is working hard to tear down it's hard won mindshare) as well as AMD and Nvidia.When AMD jumps up all the people who haven't followed along closely think the upstart is getting lucky and expect it to be kicked down again. The sentiment is easy to sway. There are a lot of investors that are up to the gills in margin planning to retire on this in a couple years.Unfortunately, it's a rich environment for games.  Maybe it won't take any hit at all. Maybe the market mavens have all started to equate AMD with Intel and recognize the magic. Maybe Intel won't put their finger on the scale this time. Maybe the stock price will go straight up for the next four years. Maybe the market really is rational and fully informed at all times.Maybe I'll start believing in unicorns!",
Your thesis relies on the size of the (anti)-correlation between AMD and NVIDIA when it comes to graphics card news. I don't disagree: this is something I have previously observed. But by now it is of historical interest only - the two should be far less coupled than they are. At some point the market will wake up to that and these kind of short-term plays will no longer work.,

"Austin,Long AMD, but open to listening to potential hazards to it's relentless march upwards. Since I don't really follow NVDA, and since it's not clear to me from your article, tell me please, is NVDA preparing these GPU's for gamers, miners or for data centers?  If any two or all three, what % of the new product would they be targeting for each of those markets? My question is a serious one, because as a non-techie, I'd like to know where AMD is expected to lose market share. I get/read (somewhat) that AMD leads NVDA in GPU sales to miners but not to gamers.

"@jialins No, AMD has a better DC product (CPU side) than Intel and it costs AMD less to make the better product.I somewhat agree on nVidia, but they will not lower prices while people are still buying the products at the higher prices and they are perceived to be the ""crown jewel"" GPU.That may change later and it could be AMD will have a newer GPU that is cheaper to make than Vega.

"There are many reasons to sell AMD. I was thinking that people gone totally bananas when i saw AMD jumping over $20. On the other hand, I though the same a number of times for Nvidia.While AMD will lose market share to Nvidia in the GPU market, it will gain in server market. Those two will balance next quarter, that's why AMD gave a, lower than expected 1.7 billions revenue number, but still equal to this quarter. And better sales in servers, is better than better sales in GPUs, so profits should be higher next quarter.From there, 4th quarter and forward, the real threat is the i7 9900K and Intel's pricing, NOT Nvidia. If Intel puts a very aggressive pricing on the 9th series of Core CPUs and that's a possibility considering that they will allow support of the new chips on the 300 series chipsets, then we are in trouble. If they put high prices on the new models, we are just fine.In any case, anyone thinking waiting until last minute to see if he will hold or short AMD's shares, should keep an eye on the 9000 series from Intel and their prices. A 9900K at 8700K price, is a huge ""run for your lives"" signal.",

"@Austin Craig You are:Long NVDAShort AMDAs part of your thinking did you happen to notice that NVDA is 8x the market cap of AMD at current prices?The following facts are well know:AMD is coming in late Q4  to take AI share in the datacenter with Vega 7nm X2 that will blow the doors off of Volta.     Yes, AMD is coming to hurt NVDA where it hurts most - in the data center.Recent reviews show AMD driver improvements have GPUs completely competitive across all price points in current market.     1080 ti has an advantage at highest end, but the price is higher.     Price/performance is what matters - not age.By the time new NVDA products are shipping it will be Q4 and AMD will be ramping like crazy in laptops that are selling like hotcakes because they keep going out of stock everywhere.   I own two Ryzen laptops (work and home) and they are awesome machines.   They dust Intel notebooks regardless of  price - but happen to be half the price - that's why they are selling like crazy.    Epyc servers also steeply ramping as  AMD hits 5% market share by end of year.AMD will make Polaris 3 in 12 nm and  slap GDDR6 on it and will compete well at all the middle price points.I'm sure the NVDA next gen gaming GPUs will be good.    But Lisa Su is being her usual brilliant self and choosing to attack  NVDA where it hurts the most - in the high end datacenter.We all know NVDA is GPU only.  No CPUs, no APUs.    TAM addressed by NVDA is a small fraction of TAM addressed by AMD.Once again - NVDA is 8X the market cap of AMD!!!!!    I have no problem investing in NVDA - but being short AMD?     In my opinion, the person that appears to have cognitive problems evaluating companies seems to be you.   Since you are handing out investing advice - please tell your followers when you decide to cover in real time - not a week or month after.     Did you cover already?    I can't wait to see how your recommendation works out.",

"Hey Austin, thank you for sharing your opinion but I would respectfully disagree with it :) ""The point is that AMD receives a substantial swath of its revenue from the GPU side of its business and that is about to be directly impacted with no obvious counter measure being publicly announced. Maybe a Polaris 3.0 refresh comes out with a 15% gain as rumored. While nice, this is still 2016 tech.""AMD Vega desktop cards do not sell due to their gaming capabilities and Turing cards will not displace them for that matter. Last time I checked, most of their GPU sales are in everything but desktop gaming rigs. Meanwhile, AMD will refresh their RX 580 with GDDR6 with 12nm process - just like Pascal refresh aka Turing. It will still be able to compete on price with GTX 1160 (the largest market segment) so I expect no market share changes there. Also, as you have demonstrated yourself, the new cards will be more expensive and will compete with themselves - not AMD. This is NVIDIA giving gamers a chance to spend more if they want the latest, and that is where they have no competition at the moment. Lastly, I expect NVIDIA to announce poor earnings results due to a serious of screw ups. First of all, they overestimated the crypto demand and were left with large invetory of old gen cards. Since NVIDIA fans want the best, they would rather wait out for new cards to land. In the end, NVIDIA is stuck with many cards this quarter that no one wants to buy. Making the announcement would help the public finally pull the trigger and buy up some old gen cards - realizing that the new cards are more expensive for equivalent performance (1160 = 1070 in performance). IMO buying up some call options after NVIDIA Q2 ER sounds like a play I would make.",
"John Gulu,I doubt very much NVDA Turing will not be 7nm , and all indications point to it being 7nm, or, if not, will be quickly changed to 7nm.  NVDA is always on top on GPU's; that is their wheelhouse and that is why they have risen like a FANG stock, as they are the top of the heap.Yes, AMD has gone after the server market, but do you really think NVDA is not pushing their wares to the server market as well?",
"Sold @19.2. I think amd is great company and i have built 3 amd systems so far. But, it is not necessarily a great stock because of its size and gen lag. If intel or nvda wants its market share back, it simply have to lower its price and puff amd market is gone. In other words, amd is only gaining mkt share by offering lower prices, and not even winning on the performance per dollar basis (vs. intel on mainstream cpus). Lower price results in less profit, and lower profit is there to stay.",
"There is a lot of speculation on the technology used for the upcoming Nvidia Turing chips. Are these 7nm or 12nm chips. If they are releasing these chips in August, it would be very difficult to make it 7nm. AMD is focused on the bigger fish - data center. Vega 20 and Epyc2 at 7nm could not come out early enough to dip into the biggest TAM with the largest scoop while Intel still has trouble producing 10nm. I don't think the loss to AMD in gaming would be significant compared to gains in data center if Nvidia is neglecting its data center and going with 12nm chips.",

"How can someone short AMD when EPYC is ramping up in Q3 2018 and new  Mega Datacenter customer can be announced anytime! Both for Q3 and Q4 2018 I am expecting revenue and earnings surprise to the upside.""I had the chance to talk with AMD CEO Lisa Su after earnings and she was very bullish about Epyc’s future more now than ever. She is happy to see cloud deployments accelerating this quarter and is expecting the cloud giants to increase their Epyc compute instances over the coming quarters. While Su is happy with the progress with Baidu, Azure, and Tencent, she feels “great” about getting a few more in the second half.  Su told me that the competitive situation is helping, specifically, Intel’s 10nm datacenter push to 2020. She says she has had many more strategy conversations with customers over the last 60 days, not just about what AMD can do in the next year, but what it can do over the next three years.Su is happy with progress in the public cloud datacenter, but is pragmatic on the enterprise datacenter as customers take longer to do just about everything. “The sales cycle takes a while and we are building out our GTM (go-to-market) with our OEMs. We’re hiring BDEs (business development executives) like crazy.” What AMD needs to watch is creating enough demand quickly enough. Based on my experience, OEMs better fulfill demand versus create it. This area is where Intel has a distinct advantage, with thousands of BDEs globally, who have been in enterprise accounts for decades, not to mention the mountain of cash to market its wares.  AMD is intelligently focusing its GTM resources on verticals and workloads where it performs well, namely the HPC (high-performance computing) market, tier 2 CSPs and big data/analytics workloads, and workloads where VM per dollar matter. AMD has some advantages here with its high-performance FPU and its high-bandwidth, single socket design.Su highlighted a large, multinational auto manufacturer that first evaluated Epyc given their strong needs around memory bandwidth.  She said that the enterprise’s benchmarking showed that at scale, two servers of EPYC outperformed three Skylake servers for crash test simulations.  Su continued, explaining, that evaluation clusters were then turned over to their corporate IT teams and there was a significant performance per dollar value shown and AMD won the deployment. Su ended by saying her teams have many of these examples.""www.forbes.com/...",

Its happening as we speak...where this bottoms out before we see an uptick back into earnings again is anyones guess...I am hoping its going to set a new floor in the $16 ish range...We can all agree that AMD did what we hoped it would do, beat earnings both top line and bottom line handedly, reaffirm guidance, show ""less CRYPTO dependency"" to those want to use that as a reason to be LT short AMD, not that it ever really did depend on CRYPTO to drive financial performance.  I sold my $16 and $17 call options at around the $19.50 stock price and made a very nice gain.

Before the earnings we had Authors like @Akram who where concentrating on Crypto and saying its not a buy. @Austin sold majority of his holdings before the earnings because of Crypto Fear and missed the upside and now he wants recover his ,would be, profit by shorting.The problem with all these Authors is that they are not able to piece together different pieces of information and bring out a holistic picture. They either look only at technical, Crypto, Q3 2018 Guidance, Sharp upward price movement or Trade Wars. Many of them have lost the up move because either they were sidelined during Q2 earnings or sold their holding immediately after the earnings.Do you want to take advise from people who have their own personal agenda or dont have good handle on AMD growth story?AMD is now the darling of Wall Street. Lisa Su mentioned large market share for EPYC in Q4 2018. In second half of 2019 AMD will be selling ROME with 64cores 128 thread. Very soon after this we will have Ryzen on 7nm. Vega 7nm is already sampling and will be ready by end of this year. AMD is hiring Business Development Executives like Crazy (Lisa Su words). Market Penetration of AMD products will increase manifolds between second half of 2019 and second half of 2020. By 2021 AMD will be fully ramped up.If you can figure out what the Revenues / Earnings will be by end of 2018 and in 2021 you will understand how much potential is still in front of you. By EOY in 2018 AMD stock price will be ~25 and by 2021 it will be ~150. So why give away many folds of returns by exiting now because of consolidation (which is normal as AMD stock has gone up more than 20% in 3 days).

Vega did appear to be a flop for the reasons you stated ( and preformance-wise it never dethroaned the top tier ), and I think that's reflected somewhat in the Steam metrics where it appears Vega was only able to claw back about 5% of the gamer market, where over the course of it's life, I think Pascal took a wholloping huge chunk.  I've been disappointed NVDA has been holding it's fire this long on dropping Turing.

"Vega undervolted slightly and overclocked by 5% is holding up great in newer games with DX12. Did you see the performance hit HDR put on NVIDIA Gpus vs Vega maintaining higher min and avg FPS? You are spewing the same rhetoric touted upon Vegas initial release: power hungry, hot, barely matches 1070/1080. Well updated reviews show that gap closing, and as usual AMD cards age well with driver updates and Nvidia begins its EOL process so you're forced into next gen.Not saying Polaris isn't outdated nor that vega is stellar. But it's certainly not a failure.Unfortunately $AMD will have to settle for a 12nm+ Polaris ""30"" to maintain midrange gpu sales.Have you read the leaks of AMDs 28cu, 1200mhz clocked ""Fuenhaung"" APU which showed up on 3dmark benchmark suite and blew away the Intel+Vega collab?

"@Austin Craig ,AMD is volatile, so maybe you get lucky. But I have trouble seeing AMD enough under 17 for those puts to be useful. I don't think it matters too much what GPUs NVDA releases in the near term. AMD can trade some of that low margin revenue for the large gains in higher revenue products they will be making. AMD is right to focus on datacenter first for the new 7nm GPUs. Again, high margin products are where it makes sense for AMD to grow.",

And this just might backfire on you! Look what happen when Intel reported it launched AMD even more! When NVDA reports and they mention that they’re still not launching until next year that will launch AMD even further! Apple in a few minutes can make AMD go even higher with iMac sales!

AMD by my estimate will need another 1.4 to 1.6 billion for R&D and production capital needs to be invested this year.

I mean, GLNG is poised to have a ramp-up in cash flows, I think, over next 12 months, starting quite soon (like, already). That could blead to a very huge, justified and sensible run-up.I have not seen updated research on GLNG (except latest super-bullish GLNG presentation) so my timing may be a bit off or rusty.I am little under-water on GLNG (about -2.5%).I am back in GMLP at 16.19. Probably a trade but, depending on how things go, could be a bit of yield-driven adventure (hopefully not mis-adventure).",
"I'm confused... so is Julie's payout coverage math in the very first comments post accurate, or is it not accurate due to a GNL/GLNG/GMLP mix up?  I have a big GMLP position, half with cost basis of around $8, half around $14-and-change... and with the recent (last 4-5 days) move up I wonder if I should sell all...Thx",
This is clearly about gmlp’s parent glng.,
The company named was GMLP.  Which was it Julie Lowe???Thanks,
Thanks Tomtom.,
"I believe he's talking GNL, not GMLP.",
"GMLP has distribution coverage of .32x and even after the drop down of the two Hilli trains, the coverage is still only about .7x.  A couple ships are coming off charter and will be added to the spot fleet. Maybe those ships find good work, maybe not. There are a couple of re-gas/gas projects on the boards.  But even assuming that those opportunities come to fruition, they wouldn't contribute to cash for a couple years.  The current distribution appears at risk.  Management has cash on hand and from an un-drawn revolver to maintain the distribution. That is different than cash from operations. Payouts funded from debt or working capital will ultimately reveal themselves on the balance sheet. If things go very well for GMLP, they will avoid a cut and maintain the +/-8.5% payout. If things go less than very well, then there will be a cut and a corresponding fall in the unit price. There is no apparent catalyst to propel the unit price higher, and there is substantial downside risk.",Financial Exchange Stock Talk: J Mintzmyer On Teekay LNG Partners And Golar LNG
"To write an article about how the implosion of value that is occuring in the Star Wars portion of the Disney empire by citing how things overall are doing well is wrong headed.  Just because Marvel, Pixar and other Disney brands are doing well doesnt mean that Lucas Films hasnt veered off the tracks.  Kathleen Keendy's use of Star Wars for her social justice point of view is alienating Star Wars core audience and box office results are telling.  Does this mean Disney studios cant compensate?  No, but is does mean that we are witnessing value destruction and Executive incompetence on a mindboggling scale.  Prediction:  next Star Wars film fails, Kathleen Kennedy is shown the door, they reboot the franchise.",
"I think the issue is less ""Disney has killed the golden goose by having it lay too many eggs"", but rather having the goose lay a couple of rotten eggs.  The Last Jedi and Solo were bad movies with rather poor audience scores. The fear (for me at least) is that the franchise can't sustain too many more bad movies before fans lose interest and the value of the franchise tanks.",
Disney is going to crush-buy now for the long run-think 10-15 yrs,
"No, Disney hasn't killed the ""golden goose by having it lay too many eggs"". They're killing it by hiring sub-par writer/directors who can't come up with original ideas and who put their own social ideology ahead of the traditional characters and themes.  This really isn't the place for it but if you want to see what real fans feel about the new movies do as one poster above suggested and watch some reviews of TLJ on youtube.There is a tremendous appetite for quality content.  They could do a movie every six months and if the quality is there people will see it.  They don't even have to spend $300 million or whatever on the production--TLJ as an example was chock full of space battles that felt forced and uninspired.  What they do need is a strong VISIONARY CREATIVE TALENT (of which Abrams and Johnson are clearly not) and to surround them with a TEAM of skilled and experienced writers (just like Lucas was smart enough to do).  When you entrust everything to just one regular guy like they did for  TFA & TLJ then you get a status quo action movie and its no surprise when people get bored and tune you out",

"TLD felt forced. The attempt to be progressive was overdone and obvious, the humor often cheapened the characters in serious moments, and the whole scene with the casino felt like a forced addition to pander to someone's own agenda. Yes war profiteering and sometimes animal racing are morally  reprehensible, but a SW movie ie not the time or place to make those points, it's like a sorority girl took over the movie in a brief but epic struggle over whether the director was going to get his late.

Solo was good but I’m a Star Wars fan that likes getting new Star Wars. It should have been a December release at minimum. Long DIS,
Part of the controversy around the new Star Wars is in the PR disaster of Lucasfilm executives and creative attacking Star Wars fans in interviews and on Social Media.

"I doubt that IBM is about to pummel anyone but we may be getting a glimpse of better times. I would not take a full position but a nibble might be worthwhile, given the dividend. A 4.35% qualified dividend taxed at 15% has some allure. IBM is performing in the Cloud business but a) is overshadowed by AWS and MSFT, and b) the legacy business remains a drag. They seem to be near the bottom as to share price although the PE ratio remains fairly high at 23 times. They appear to be selling a growth story.",

And with super high valuation growth blowing off (NFLX, FB, etc.), IBM may start to look more attractive if money flows to value vs. growth.The technical picture is still not that clear, in my view at least. The stock popped off earnings but lost those gains immediately. i would like to see the July 17th low hold, and the stock start to build a base before I would get too excited. I kicked out my long after the last earnings report and did buy stock today at 144.50, and shorted some Dec 140 puts.

You mentioned that you’ll sell if it goes below your purchase price, but at what percentage loss?

"Hello Sir Fun Trading,Again you write a very complete article about Yamana Gold. Thanks!There is not much to add in my opinion.Maybe this:The USD-dollar will come down significantly: Gold and specifically SILVER will benefit from the USD-dollar inflation. (Think trade-tarrifs, think rate-hikes that cause inflation and Trump is usingthe dollar as a weapon... )The nr. 1 reason for me to invest in AUY is the significant growth in silver production. That caughtmy eye. There are NO other miners who will show such a huge growth in real silver production (also percentage wise)than Yamana.Cerro Moro reported to have better grade than expected...hencethe 3-rd quarter results should beat prior guidance.Will Yamana Gold be able to sell Gualcamayo in Q3? That's a big question: I think yes. Yamana Gold was alsoable to sell Brio Gold to Leagold. Leagold might be interested in Gualcamayo? (I don't know: I am guessing here)Another positive fact is that Yamana Gold apparently is in talks with a copperminer about Agua Rica...that could be good news. My wet thumb (I don't know)...is it BHP Billeton? or Goldcorp?The weak USD-dollar will be a big factor for the miningsector. Silver will rocket up.

This is a good piece for BP. US shale is much easier to produce returns than many other places in the world. Getting it to market is so much easier and into distribution channels.It was a good deal for BHP they got the cash on a project that would not be able to profit from without massive capex.,
Great acquisition for BP. Lack of investment has created strong oil prices will help future earnings.Any chance that China becomes an investor in Venezuela and Nigeria and turns around the production declines enough to impact oil prices?,
"Long on BP.  The Permian Basin is going through its third rebirth.  Eagle Ford is okay and Haynesville should hold its own.  With the increase in exporting of LNG, Haynesville should grow in importance.  BHP made a stab at Louisiana Austin Chalk but failed to follow through and decided to bail out of the oil patch entirely.   Surprised that XOM did not buy in, but I would not be surprised if BP sells some of its acquisition to other majors like XOM.  Things are beginning to boom in the oil patch.",
Probably a good deal for both companies.  The market prefers pure plays and this is a way for BHP to exit its hydrocarbon investments so that it can focus on its core competency - being the world's biggest mining company.,
"Good article and I share your conclusions.  BP appears to be the guy that fell in the outhouse and came out smelling like a rose.  Due to the gulf oil spill BP needed cash and quickly.  One of the steps they took was to sell their shale holdings.  No one knew at that time that in a few years OPEC would target fracking by glutting the market with oil.  BP escaped the meltdown in shale asset value.  While they were out of that market those that stayed and others bought up assets of those that failed.  Those companies and BP also improved fracking technology to drastically reduce the price of extraction.  Once those new efficiencies were achieved BP ends up with great cash flow and reenters the US shale market.  BP has applied big data analytics to fracking along with a new operational model that will reduce the cost of extraction, driving more cash flow.  Now the big challenge is can the pipeline companies expand capacity fast enough to get this oil and gas to market.  When you couple this with Portugal building import facilities and pipelines to France this is an excellent time to acquire more BP, LNG, KMI and others.",

It is just the opposite: NXP is grossly overvalued as a standalone company.,

"Sorry, perhaps not completely clear. Market cap should increase when excess cash is returned to shareholders as debt is cheaper than equity.",
"Thank you for your article with some good perspectives. I don’t follow that market cap remains the same. The market cap (or market equity value) is simply equal to market enterprise value (EV) minus NET debt (so debt minus cash). Excess cash will go to shareholders anyhow they wisely promised. Actually EV has to be recalculated as 2 years of progress and share price reaction is missing. So interesting share and I am long. EV is equal to net present value of future cash flows and buying your own shares won’t change that number. Less cash will change that number so market cap will decrease and I suspect all analysts will understand that and include that in their DCF calculations. There is excess borrowing capacity so no doubt that also EV can increase some because of reaching optimal debt capacity whatever that % will be. Both CEO and CFO keep on stressing that they have excess cash and that will distribute this ASAP to shareholders. So good news and the 2 billion USD is also extra in the pocket. My analysis:Top line growth is not okay. Margins are okay. Market is very okay. And market position is very very okay. That alone should deserve a higher P/E than they have now.So execution is key now and Mr Market needs to see top-line growth in core segments while keeping their margins because that is what dominant players should do.I see more positives than negatives so I am in. And yes, analyst show and execution will be key triggers. If they keep their leadership position in automotive they deserve a much higher p/e multiple.",
"In the tech field, I wouldn't understate the importance of a company knowing how to sell its vision to Wall Street and how to generate shareholder value beyond just plugging away at operations. Maybe its a cultural thing but NXPI doesn't seem to have a shareholder value culture in their higher ranks. They also strike me as a company that's lucked its way into producing the right products at the right time rather than having a specific vision about the future of tech that they are pursuing. That said, the company represents growth at a reasonable price which is a hard characteristic to find in any stock these days. Most people should have space for a GARP stock or two in their portfolio. I'm long NXP but have a much bigger position in QCOM. I can see QCOM accelerating their pace of innovation a lot more over the next five years than NXP which at best may grow at a modestly faster pace than present. QCOM has rested on its laurels for much too long but the company is still capable of awesome things.",

MU announced buyback did not have yet a good impact on the share.,
"IMHO, there are two reasons for holding the price down. The first issue is management. They were ready to cash out and expected to be retired a year ago. It is unlikely that they have been preparing for the near/mid/long-term as a stand-alone company. The CEO, on CNBC, seemed very tired to me.  The second issue applies to NXPI and lots of other companies - takeovers are on hold.  Is China simply going to squash all M&A as a tool in its trade war with USA? This will eventually get solved, but I don't think anything solves the management issue (other than new management).",

Apple needs to buy NXP and add to there autonomous vehicle program. Just saying :),
"Thaks for the article, but regarding the buyback, you can't assume that the valuation should remain completely unchanged after spending a large amount of cash to buy back shares.  In the end a dollar is a dollar.  Any inherent valuation calculation should at least assume that after spending $5b of cash to buy back and retire shares, the valuation should somehow reflect $5b less in assets on their balance sheet.  Just subtracting $5b from market cap might be too simplistic, but still it'd be more accurate IMO than no change at all.",
Definitely something to consider.,
For those NXP stock owners that thought $127/share wasn't enough - your not going to see that price again anytime soon.  But I agree with the general premise that this stock should go up from where it is currently.  They still have a great business model and in good financial shape.  The buyback will help the stock price too.  I just bought some shares as well.,
Excellent review and breakdown. Much thanks!,
"I think one added risk always has to be accounted for (by a discount to the perceived fair value of the company) when the acquisition of a company fails, particularly if it's not due to fault of the buyer... whether it's due to the target company or to government forces: The company cannot be bought or is more difficult to buy, and therefore is not as liquid an asset, as was originally thought.Compared to peers where this risk has not (yet) been exposed, the danger is emphasized, hence the exaggerated-appearing discount to fair value you see today.",
"For this reason I am Long NXPI. However, I am too exposed in the stock, as are probably a lot of investors, since they knew this prior to the failed buyout. That being said, I'll be up on this position by year end",
"So why does NXPI not jump in Right Now and spend their Buyback Funds and buy at $95? Is it because they think they will be able to buy shares lower than $95 or they do not want to drive up the share price? At this point nobody I know wants to own NXPI (and I am a NXPI Shareholder). This 2 year wait has exhausted investor patience and NXPI should jump in and be buying, but the share Volume (Mon. July 30 and Tues. July 31) does not reflect a major share repurchase program underway. In fact NXPI is showing a tendency to stall at $95. Look at QCOM shares this morning and the Volume. QCOM is Up $2.50 to $64.50 on almost 9 million shares in the first 90 minutes and the QCOM Daily Average is 9.7 million shares. Clearly somebody QCOM maybe, is buying above normal numbers of QCOM shares. NXPI is not displaying that, in fact it is displaying pitiful volume for a Management that has the ability to Buyback 15% of the Company on a moment’s notice. I am starting to think NXPI Management has “a deer in the headlights” mentality at this moment and is shell shocked and afraid to do anything. They need to jump into the fight and do something rather than to appear impotent. JMHO and I am an NXPI Shareholder.",
"Revenues not growing, no killer ip, failed deal , whats to buy ?",
"""Whatever you believe the proper market cap is for NXPI, the share price should increase by about 17% if the company buys back 14.5% of its shares at $100""That is incorrect because they will have less cash/more debt on the balance sheet in order to execute that buyback. By the exact amount they buyback.While the math is not that simple, remaining owners will enjoy a ~15% increase in percentage ownership of the company. So if future results are good, they can benefit.",
Don't you have to reduce the market cap by the amount of cash spent on the buyback?,
"@Vas Research Thanks for the time you put in writing this up. Unfortunately, this seems like it's mostly a review of where things stand at this point, as opposed to a projection of where they're headed. I realize I'm saying something like, ""Unfortunately you wrote this article, when I'd have liked to see THAT article"". Not particularly constructive feedback, I know. And I can always go write my own damn article, I guess.NXPI has historically traded at a discount to its semiconductor peers. I believe the reason for this discount is that NXP has grown more slowly than its peers. The key question, to me, is a) should there be a discount? and b) if so, what is the correct discount? I think we need to hear from someone with a bearish perspective on NXPI to get the answer to that.The gap in valuation between NXP and it's peers has widened since October 2016. But maybe it was valued too high two years ago, and now it's being valued correctly. I doubt it, but I am uncertain.It looks to me like NXPI has the highest free cash flow per share among it's peer group. It's operating margin appears to be in line with that of other analog semiconductor manufacturers. If it can demonstrate earnings growth, or even present a plan for earnings growth at the upcoming Analyst Day, it could make an argument to present and potential shareholders that it should be valued more closely to its peers.Buying back shares will increase earnings per share, but won't impact actual earnings or free cash flow. To do that, they're going to have to reduce costs or grow the top line. Now that ZTE is purchasing components again, maybe NXP will have an opportunity to show an increase in revenues when it reports Q3 earnings in late October.",

"CDR’s (Chinese Depository Receipts) took a bad turn when China (Gov’t) tried to lower the offering price of Xiaomi just before they went public.  What was to be the first CDR with a dual listing in Hong Kong ended up going to Hong Kong only.  The Chinese have warned against a market bubble especially for tech stocks whether that’s actually the fact.  The Chinese are looking to lower the price of the initial offering of CDR’s so that Chinese investors can invest at a discount to what a CDR trades for on the US markets or other markets.  What seemed like a great way to offer the big Chinese tech titans to the Chinese investor now looks like a play by the Chinese Gov’t to control the price of these Chinese tech titans if and/or when they list in China as a CDR.  It’s not a free market in China and if you invest in Chinese stocks thinking it is a free market then be careful.  It now appears that the Chinese Gov’t is looking to control CDR’s and to slowly squeeze the listings on the International exchanges so that eventually all Chinese companies are listed and controlled by the Chinese.  Allowing the big IPO’s to list internationally allows the Chinese companies to raise capital from the international markets, but eventually they want to bring them home to reap the long term rewards for the Chinese people.  That’s why the requirements to list a CDR only allow a handful of Chinese companies to qualify.  Think Baba, JD, Baidu, Tencent etc.  The Chinese Gov’t doesn’t want the riskier Chinese listings.  Genius!  Float the IPO’s to ignorant Westerners and bring them home once they are established and consistently profitable Chinese companies.  I don’t have the answers on how to invest in Chinese stocks but beware of companies who offer CDR’s.  At least initially it appears a CDR listing may put downward pressure on a Chinese stock.  It’s just a way for the big tech titans to become State owned.  The biggest buyer of CDR’s will be the Chinese Gov’t.",
"The author clearly knows what he is talking about. He deserves much more follower.Just want to clarify one point :The purpose of CDR is to direct huge amount of private capital to China’s high tech firms.China’s national goal is to replace US as number one in the world, in technology, in economy, and in military.Step #1 is to conquer the high tech area, thus “2025 Smart Manufacturing”. This is the war Trump is fighting, our own survival.CDR is coming, because it’s national policy.",

Maybe waiting one quarter or two to see how numbers play out will give us a better idea of how the company is doing. On a different note, I do not want to underestimate the purchasing power of tier 3 or 4 cities. China is expanding with the pace which has never been seen before.

"Form 4 info reported by MintBroker International contained an interesting typo on it- go back to July 27th (Friday) and you will see that they reported that they BOUGHT 192,340 shares at a weighted average price of $15.50.  Then today, five days later, they disclosed that these shares were SOLD at that price, not bought.Keep in mind that Friday's regular session high was only $11.21 a share, so much if not all of the sale had to occur during Friday's after hours session.Was the disclosure of the sale that was reported initially as a buy done so intentionally?  I'll leave that for others to decide.  I feel sorry for anyone who thought MintBroker was really buying more shares at $15+ and jumped in at/near the top as a result.It would be very interesting to know how MintBroker ended up doing on this trade. The knee-jerk response is to assume that they made a killing, and the shares sold at $15+ seem to suggest that.  But that was only about 10% of their position.  Assuming they were fairly aggressive buyers Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (when there was lots of volume being reported and the stock was going up sharply), it is possible that they didn't really make nearly as much as many would think.",

"Hey Kevin, hey guys,I've got a theory I'd like to shoot around.  With so many macro catalysts happening in the cannabis space,  you'd think these stocks would be flying upward.  But with market softness they are not.  If the Farm Bill, Sessions stepping down, added licenses being granted in the U.S. by additional States, or any other catalyst happened before Oct. 17th we'd see these stocks soaring.  But instead we are not.My theory is, hold tight.  Don't sell if you've invested in best of breed Cannabis companies.  Wait for an even bigger bottom before buying back in again... and don't invest too much as another bottom can approach.Come Q2/Q3 numbers of 2019, I believe this whole sector will be rebounding at least 50% from today's levels.  Analysts, institutional money and a large portion of big money investors are going to want to see solid numbers before buying in.  They've said this all along.  As the earnings reports continue to show substantial growth, more and more money will be coming into the sector.  If  you think we've seen FOMO in the past, we may see it just the same if not higher.These are not broken companies just broken stocks.  I'm riding it out cause I'm going to ride it right back up the ladder as well.  Even if it's a small gain in one year's time or four years time, it's still a gain.  And if you're not in a ROTH, after a year you save on capital gain taxes when you sell the gains.  This is my plan as I know if you've invested wisely in best of breed companies, you're going to be fine in the long run.My best in breed holdings largest holdings are ACB, ITHUF, LHSIF, SNNVF, and ORHOF.

They will each push their brand through their own dispensary, but it is unclear how they will get non-affiliated dispensaries to sell them effectively.  I think OH has a very good strategy for building a brand.  They try to distribute as many products as possible.  They see the differentiated products that are selling well.  They invest in them and help them to be strong brands in California.  That makes total sense.  I am not sure how easy it will be translate that into a different state, but hopefully they will figure that out by then.

The website doesn't show any plants inside the facility yet.  They have a deal with Canopy to supply them with product starting in Q1 but I don't think that will be the case.  I'm thinking this is why we've seen a decline in stock price on top of other technical factors.Kevin, you dipping back in?  I see them like Aurora in the parallel that I loaded up on Aurora as they dipped into August.  Sunniva seems to be playing the same cards as I'd say they are greatly oversold right now. **Providing their Cathedral City plan continues and their vertical integration remains on path.",

"Is it too late to get into cannaroyalty ? Looking to purchase 3,000 shares ?",
@Jonathan5922 Interrested in why you say that.  Care to share your thoughts?M (always looking to learn),
I can see Namaste's earnings going up in the short term for Province's that have less physical stores and rely more on online sales but in the longterm I think Andrew Left may have a winner in shorting N.,
"Thanks, and interesting article from Ben Smith for sure.  Per your comment up above, there will be lots of land mines to avoid as well as good performers to jump on, once legalization hits, but it sure looks like a slow moving train and thus, we may have time to act intelligently.  After considering the 3 scenarios Ben painted, buying at the dips and selling at the highs looks justified, but no radical movements.  After legalization I expect more of the same except for what I believe for sure will happen and that's another announcement coming from Diageo or Coca Cola or Pepsi, or a big pharma or big tobacco....I believe we can count on one or more of those positive catalysts going forward from Oct 17th and I sure want to be in full play during the ensuing bump up.Per the below comment from that article, seems like Namaste may get a boost here with their ""Pineapple Express"" capabilities:""There’s also the possibility that online systems could operate sub-optimally due to consumer demand. There’s a looming Canada Post strike, which has been averted for now. But the postal union is obviously going to play hardball with cannabis legalization as its primary bargaining chip. Private sector distribution will not be able to substitute for Canada Post’s absence should they walk out.""",
"@Kevin Jackson I really like your thinking since it frequently jives with mine but here I have a question.Of course there will be a pullback after Oct 17th, if nothing else but a relief pause but to me the quesiton is HOW MUCH of a pullback.  I expect a small one whereas you seem to think it may be more serious. But I do have a bias which I list below:Pot stocks have moved me into a higher tax bracket this year and I am trying to wait until 2019 before I sell more.  WIth that bias of mine in mind, what do you think of the Xmas rally and the January Effect re: pot stocks.  Have you considered if those two historical rising periods for equities will perform well enough to make back what was sold off after legalization day (if indeed there is a BIG selloff since a small one would mean nothing)?  My guess is many that have been in the Pot sector have had big gains and hence, are buying before January and selling in the new year.  So I expect the stocks to rise (with minor blips) to January and my plan is to sell in early January, during any heavy buying pressure.Any comments to help me think this through?M",

"Looks like a good buying opp now for SNNVF.  I previously sold a position far above these levels.  Wash, rinse, repeat.Btw, anyone invest in ADVT, Advantis Corp.  Good U.S. company with steady revenue increasing year over year and with their packaging technology it passes most States' regulations.

Good update Kevin.This aligns with my plan to consolidate to a few big names as we get past Oct 17th.,

I use to buy in at $1.35 and sell at $1.60, then my level of support was $1.55, then $1.60...it's just been slowly going up and while the highs have been going up.  It's a wave and you have to buy the dips and sell the highs.  Right now, I'm buying in anytime it drops below $1.80...I'll shot for low $1.70s.",

I have as you know an allocation and other than Sunniva , LXRP and LHSIF, I have to let Canada play out for some cash. Yes I do believe we will have a party and I will probably go home early and see the New Year come in in a different perspective. I realize by the time of my exit around the middle of December will have lost me some valuable early investments, I believe it may take that long or longer for the US to be real. With gains on the books I will have options to wait for Canada to refill the cookie jar and watch the US. Not the worst spot I have ever been in. PS. You old Cafe Bohemian, you ain't getting rid of me that easy. lee",
"Great new thoughts here, thank you Kevin.  The good news is, the big money is pouring into the Canadian majors and the American cannabis sector has taken a back seat.  This will allow for more DD and more patience in buy-ins in the American cannabis space.  My buy-ins to CannaRoyalty and Sunniva paid off very well three week ago as they were both oversold.Kevin, I agree that Liberty, Ianthus, Acreage (when they IPO) and the others you mentioned are ripe for now.  Especially Liberty IMO as I believe they're vastly oversold and possibly one of the more oversold Americans on the board with their east coast presence. Personally, I'm waiting for the Diageo deal to go through and then hit the chosen Canadian hard.  Profits can be used to buy into the Americans which should be simmering for a while and still have major upside, while the Canadians are booming.  I feel the ebb and flow of the Canadians and the American stocks should see-saw and allow for well timed plays on both sides.As long as there's no Fed intervening any time soon, i.e., Sessions making cannabis legal, we should be able to play both the Canadians and Americans at the same time with preference on the Canadians while building positions on the Americans.  Once the Americans become legal, we should see the same effect we're seeing on Canada right now.  There's a lot of road ahead to work with and patience coupled with well researched aggressiveness should pay off handsomely.  Thank you Kevin for keeping this thread going and your insight.",
"@Kevin Jackson I too would like to add to CannaRoyalty and CannaTrust.  You think the runup will lose some steam in late September?  Maybe a dip but really, to me that is the take off time, when earth stops slowing us down.  Dip time should be in mid to late January.  Just my opinion of course and interested in why you think there won't be heavy running after all the fanfare is published about the legalization date.",

"Well, KEVIN, a long way from the small Bohemian  Cafes of Budapest!!!! Well done article , I would congratulate  your coming out party but actually SA acknowledged you as a contributor some time ago. We have always been on the same page. I dumped my Arphia a few weeks before I put $9,000 into canopy before the Constellation deal. No crystal ball just trying to optimize my meager positions . I am holding enough Canada plays that I feel secure for the next year when I believe we will have to do some real revision. I maintain my 5,000 shares of Sunniva and will probably keep all in US once the split comes. Your article mimics mine and others that California is in still running around in circles and mebarret 2 pointed out all the big US grows but as another poster suggested, what does that really mean. They are fragmented and ineffective. This falls right in line with your optimisms for CannaRoyalty ( they do need a name change). You and I both know branding is coming and with it the need for expertise in many areas. As soon as I can skim a little here and there I will by into Canna?. As for Sunniva, I can't but believe they will be  one of the biggest winners in California and I also believe as I have said before they are kissing cousins with Canopy and I believe Dr. Holler is taking a page from Linton's play book and not telling everybody everything for a reason. Remember also, there are very few laws from cousins marrying. Thanks Kevin......",
"Nice bump today on Sunniva.  My position I opened last week is up 25%.  Kevin, have you looked into Alcanna stock?  I started coverage on them and Micron Waste which will be taking care of all the compostable waste from Aurora and might expand to more companies.  Alcanna I like because of their partnership with Aurora and their presence in the North American liquor store market.  They'll be expanding to the sale of cannabis and obtaining licenses to open stores.  Plus they pay a dividend.  I go back to the example of the gold rush where you can be a miner or sell the tools like Levi Strauss did.",

I think TGOD falls into this category also but there's a whole lot more positive speculation on their side.  However, with the Canopy agreement starting in Q1 and the facilities Sunniva is building coupled with them in the American market; I can see it being a great longterm play.  Thank you again.I'm about settled in for the ride with all my Canadian cannabis stocks.  I have enough positions that it's time to just buckle up and ride-it-out with maybe another buy-in when the turn takes place.  However, I've been upping my American buys.   I feel Liberty is also a great play right now and at a very low price that will surely bounce.Appreciate the insight.  Looking forward to opening a Sunniva position very soon.  And liked the Buffett be greedy when others are fearful rule...which I believe is the one you're referring to.",
"Agree with Alan, very good summary - thanks Kevin.",
"Nice assessment, Kevin. To use a simple analogy, Sunniva is a very strong minor-leaguer waiting to get called up to the majors. Very frustrating to see these delays, but if they deliver on the financing that they have indicated, they have a great shot of recovering a lot of the losses.",
Nice article Kevin.  I'm expecting CannaRoyalty to post excellent Q3 and Q4 results with the July 1st date aftereffects in effect.  They seem poised to get a lead during this time because of the new rules.  Imagine if Sessions changes his stance.

If your scenario occurs and I am in stocks I will lose at least that much and not be getting any returnI guess the answer is diversity.

So here is my take.  You need to know where you are standing.  As a trader I agree these have downside risk.  However if you are retired and are happy with a 7% + yield and the worse that happens is it gets called in 5 years or readjusts to a higher yield how do I get hurt or disappointed?I believe the chance of company stopping all dividends from common to preferred is almost zero. Take the 7% and party like you were 25 again!  New to this and open to suggestions,

Thanks for all the insightful comments here. Please leave notes about stones we've left unturned -- we can turn those into specific questions for experts on follow-up podcasts. I'll also reiterate that we'll give big respect to anyone who comments with a concise SOTP valuation for BABA. We'd be only too glad to go beyond a sales multiple here.,
"Light on substance.  Would like to see more depth and research.Some known short sellers have shorted baba, like many other companies.  Joe Tsai invited Chanos to the Baba offices and he declined the invite, later capitulating on his short.Jay Clayton, now head of SEC, was an advisor on the Alibaba IPO.  Isn’t PwC still the lead auditor?  Seems legit.The story CEO is an interesting point.  However, look at Joe Tsai and the rest of the executive team.Valuing this company is also tough because of the many VC investments and behemoths (ANT) that Baba has an ownership stake in.  I hope the accounting is solid.  No reliable reason to think the accounting is wrong though.  “It is a Chinese company” is not adequate.Separately, I’ve always wondered if ANT financial generates credit risk that could somehow cause a meltdown.  I have no idea because I don’t know much about ANT.Baba is opening up a market of 1.4 billion people to the rest of the world.  Also, BABA had a 5-10 year head start on most competitors in Asia with cloud, fintech, AI, payments, etc.  Thanks for the write up and podcast.LONG BABA.",
"Sorry to say this.  Unless the discussion involves questioning/confronting the original author, podcasts like this provide little value.",
"The depth of the discussion on BABA leaves to be desired. As I listened to the podcast, I kept asking myself what message/thoughts were the two pod-casters attempting to convey? Was this a filler type of an episode? I really think you-guys can do better than this. Specially in light of the fact that you have a CFA holder on hand. Why can't he speak to the fundamentals/economics of the companies you-guys feature on your podcast? That may be more interesting than some of the rambling you-guys engaged in throughout the podcast. As it relates to Daniel's reservations about investing in companies operating in Asia in general and more particularly in China, I invite him to conduct more research on the current and future economic landscape of Asia. The fact is Asia in general is rising and there is no turning back. Accounting irregularities exist everywhere, heck former DOW stalwart GE had to restate its earnings how many times again over the past decade? While accounting is important, one should not lose of the fact that it is just a vehicle for capturing the economic events affecting a company. So if one spends a  little more time focusing on /understanding the economics of the business, the accounting will take care of itself specially if the external financial audit is performed by a  Big 10 audit shop.I will conclude by saying that I appreciate your efforts as it relates to hosting this podcast. I am sure that you-guys will keep iterating until you find the right formula.",

Angola will continue to decline until they attract new exploration investment and make new economic discoveries and these must compete for capital and foreign direct investment against US shale opportunities which are faster, cheaper, less risky with low government (plus private) take. I don't see a change in Angola mindset coming soon.  Totals investments buy a little time.",

"Also don't forget the enormous ecosystem of Solution Partners they built out. The largest IT integrator and consultancy companies are part of this, that large enterprises like to work with.

Cons was at like 84% for the next few years and they came out guiding 85-86% next year (which means 86%, at least). Personally, I’m worried they’ll need to build out a larger sales force to capture more enterprise business. The low-touch model has definitely worked better than I would have thought, and they’re the first to have ever done this and reach such a scale, but if they want to break into the IT area as their new(er) products would suggest, they will eventually need more “strategic reps”—TEAM’s fancy word for enterprise sales reps. When asked about the more IT-based products like Jira and Trello, the lack of strategic service & implementation experts (ie service revenue line for other typical software co’s) has been consistently pointed to as a deal-breaker from enterprise CTOs/CIOs who I have spoken with over the years.These (enterprise) customers will have a different sort of CAC dynamic than the current Atlassian customer base, and they will likely initially dilute the overall LTV/CAC economics of the overall company— which have historically made Atlassian so attractive. Management will have a difficult time disclosing enough in this regard to keep investors convinced underlying economics of the smaller-sized customer base are not eroding (because disclosing new enterprise business could be dangerous in terms of managing the Street). There’s also going to be execution risk as this company has never meaningfully had a sales rep-led business acquisition model, nor had to think about if a customer is or is not profitable to pursue.",Atlassian Is Priced For Perfection
woohooTeck announced another $1B cash tender offer for its debt; I'd perfer Teck knock out its 8.5% notes.,
Teck is a creme de la creme company and seriously balanced with a broad base of commodities.Another good  one is Lundin (mostly copper and zinc).,
"Let me help out your analysis. Up to 2011, TECK spent around $961M on the Fort Hills project. From 2011-2018 the cost of Fort Hills was around $3,963M. Total cost was approximately $4,924M for TECK's share of the Fort Hills Project. TECK expects their interest in Fort Hills to go up to around 21.3% depending on final capital costs etc. However with the much much much higher cost, the payback period is on the order of 20+ years. The investment was made when oil prices were much higher which also does not help. I do believe TECK is a good company, but Fort Hills was a poor investment with cost overruns. TECK also trades much cheaper than relative peers, and with Fort Hill finished the company is in a much stronger position financially, and makes for a good investment.",

Counting and exactly my 10th stock with in the last 1 year that went down after approval. I am not worried as I am still green and looking for high teens by end of the year. However a good lesson I learned about investing in biotech stocks that have good possibility of approval. NEVER BUY JUST BEFORE THE APPROVAL EVEN IF YOU FEEL THE CHANCES OF APPROVAL ARE VERY HIGH. BUY ON THE DAY OF APPROVAL. MAJORITY OF THE TIMES THE PPS TANKS ON THE DAY OF APPROVAL. My two cents. Good luck to all of us the longs.,
This stock is strong,
The catalyst was excellent but not announcing in the morning is always a red flag for killing any upward momentum. The trade halt end of day and announcement post market did the rest. Of course the long delay didn't help either as it alerted big short interest.,

They are already set up with the doctors who treat it. They have already hired 12 reps and will hire another 8 to get to 20 reps. So that is all the expense they will have. It's not like there is going to be some huge marketing campaign  or like it's going against stiff competition. Azedra should see sales right away. According the the conference call this morning they are expecting to launch in 8 weeks. It should bring money in right away because they already know who the patients are this year. They are literally waiting for the treatments.  Plus PGNX is on course to receive the $10M milestone payment from Bausch Health Sciences(Formerly VRX). They probably see that by the end of the year.  So if they do dilute, it would be for a very small amount. I just don't see them needing to dilute probably ever again.  I guess we see.",

Keep giving us your facts and conclusions, So Far, they have almost been universally wrong conclusions.

"GE Healthcare and Lantheus Announce Start of a Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Flurpiridaz, an Investigational Agent Being Evaluated for the Detection of Coronary Artery DiseaseTue July 31, 2018 8:00 AM Business Wire GE Healthcare (GHCI) and Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNTH), parent company of Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc. (collectively “Lantheus”), have started a second Phase 3 clinical trial of Flurpiridaz 18F (called the AURORA study), an investigational agent being evaluated for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common form of heart disease. CAD affects an estimated 15.5 million Americans 20 years of age or older and is the leading cause of death in the United States and in Europe, where CAD is responsible for 19% of all deaths among men and 20% of deaths among women each year. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: www.businesswire.com/... The AURORA study is an international, multicenter study to evaluate diagnostic efficacy of Flurpiridaz 18F Injection positron-emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in the detection of CAD. In this prospective, open-label, study, patients with suspected CAD, for whom an intracoronary angiography (ICA) has been indicated, will undergo a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) MPI and Flurpiridaz 18F Injection PET MPI prior to the performance of coronary angiography. The primary endpoint is the diagnostic efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of Flurpiridaz 18F Injection PET MPI for the detection of significant CAD. The first patient was enrolled in the study in June 2018. A total of 650 patients will be enrolled, with the last patient follow-up projected to occur in August 2020. Kevin O’Neill, General Manager of Core Imaging for GE Healthcare, said, “We are thrilled to see this critical stage of the study move forward. We are committed to the development of a potential new diagnostic option for clinicians and their CAD patients in the future.”",
"The stage is set for GE Power deploy technically competent and customer centric folks who can really roll up their sleeves at customer sites showing customers across the GIB ( global installed base) how collaborating with GE to leverage Predix with GE's ability to share worldwide best practices can put them in position to acquire future cost reducing opportunities. Resultant increased services revenue would be part of the win-win.  My bet is this concentration on more inclusive interaction with customers to exhibit, promote and book more services revenue will become one tenant coming out of the current campaign to fix GE Power...………….",
"C’mon Mike, if you want to be literal, you are correct. The lead director didn’t buy more for himself, he bought a much larger amount in his company’s name, The story I read also stated that Predix would be sold. It is relatively immaterial whether it’s accurate or not; what is the point is that the 12B independent sales goal for 2020 that Flannery restated last year is no longer discussed or referred to. I challenged the GE executive on GE’s ability to meet that goal when he told me that sales were 1B earlier this year. If the company spins out or sells more of its fielded base, achievement of that goal will be nearly impossible. Further, applying IofT software to the engine business is nonsense, since this has been their process long before Predix was created. Just more churn from a management which has no plan going forward except to cut costs and dispose of assets.",
"the question is, why should one buy a stock to see it shine in 12 months?  If GE finds a bottom in a couple of months --- say, at 11, twenty some percent lower than the current price --- should one not consider it then?  The author's argument --- that a stock will go up some time in the future -- is a week one because it ignores (i) the purchase price, the dominant determinant of the profitability of an investment,  and (ii) the foregone opportunities, profitable deployment of the capital tied down in the dead GE stock.  What we have here is a detailed and thoughtful answer to a wrong question.",
I continue to add,
That is no indicator of future value. We saw the lead director buy a much larger amount last year and the stock just kept going down.,
"Lead director, Larry Culp, bought 190k shares. He was former Danaher's CEO, and knows industrial and health industry inside out. Looks he agrees that GE is trading at an attractive level now.",
"Ge has put its software business including Predix on the market to be sold. This represents another change in direction by Flannery who adjusted the IofT software sales goal by 2020 to 12B. Neither the author, nor any other of the analysts can tell at this time whether spiinning out Healthcare will be better or worse for existing GE stockholders. I have outlined all the factors involved and their net could just as likely be negative as positive. After the spin out the aggregate dividend could easily be lower than it is now, the value of the Healthcare stock plus the value of the GE stick after the spin out could be less, the overhead of a Healthcare independent company with its own board higher than now and the spin out could be saddled with a disproportionate amount of debt. Further, the GE stockholders would only own 80% of the spun out company while the GE company would retain 20% which it intends to sell. How the independent stock will be affected, what are the terms of retention for existing stockholders, etc are not known at this time.",

Ok its a good company with a mine that has a low cost of production because they are staying small and heap leaching a open pit.They are doing just over 2000 oz of gold a month and 6000 oz of silver.So if everything is coming up roses why is the stock price dropping every day since it hit its high of 55 us cents at the beginning of the year? Perhaps the 200 plus million shares including options and warrants is the answer?? Maybe the company could make an announcement saying how undervalued the company is and buy back a bunch with the money they are making mining the cheap gold? Eric Sprott would not have offered them 100 mill if he did not think they could pay him back. Send out the drills and helicopters to find more places to dig holes and prove up more gold. In the old days it took at least 1 mill of proved gold in the ground before anyone took notice of your company. If they find more targets and then people might look into a take over situation.,

"They changed their deferred revenue amortization from 10 to 6.5 years that provided a big boost to sales and margins, and they never discussed that. How are you not concerned? The mix shift to iQ products should be DEFLATIONARY to pricing, yet pricing was up 20% YoY? How are you not concerned? Yes, maybe legacy warranty issues have improved some, but they are playing games with near term accounting expense (to below settlements) to improve financials. How are you not concerned?",

"[ Enphase is now three generations past the M175 with worldwide deployment of the IQ7.]  Actually 6 generations.  M175 never was sold in volume.  It was the 2nd gen M190/M210 that had mechanical issues, but that was resolved with the M215 (3rd gen) going forward... M250, S230/S270/S280, IQ6, IQ7....One of the key attributes of IQ8 is that storage is not needed for the microgrid to operate.  Yes, that may give you only a daytime microgrid, but it's better than nothing.  Enphase's microgrid is like no other out there, because it can actually curtail the solar PV power generation.  All the other microgrids are ""dumb"" on-off mechanisms; turning the solar on to charge the batteries, then turning it off, etc.   This is what cofounder Raghu Belur means when he says ""Enphase has cracked the code"", and by doing this, it will allow Enphase to offer the lowest entry point for a microgrid solution since expensive storage will be optional.  Sure, people will add storage, but they can wait for it to mature some more, and get to a lower kWh cost from the current ~$500/kWh price tag.  IQ8 will be a revolutionary microgrid solution, debuting in Q4-2018.",

Additional spot sales were reported in the mid to high $37s midweek, accounting for the current wide price range reported by Metal Bulletin. Higher numbers can still be achieved, especially where customers have tight specification, shape or brand requirements, leaving no need to “chase” the market down, sources said. Even so, the emergence of trader buying is a sign of some confidence that prices will recover after the summer. “Ultimately I’m still puzzled [by the cheap numbers],” the producer source added. “If [people are] taking a punt, arguably that’s a positive sign, and the signs are more positive now than they were a few weeks ago.”",

"""....an extremely low risk way to play the potential copper rebound.........""????????Absolutely NOTHING in the DRC is low risk. Most Western companies who have attempted operating there have lost a fortune, despite the country's obvious immense riches, because of the overpowering corruption and lack of infrastructure.Worse, listed Western companies are required to adhere over-strict Western listing compliance rules on governance and transparency while operating in this 5th world country. As I said on another thread, for companies operating in the DRC that equates to a participant in a bare-knuckle MMA fight being required to adhere to Queensbury boxing rules. Which is why the Chinese, who can prosper in such environments, are taking over almost all resources thereTBH, I would say any investment in the company is 70% politics (ie corruption and instability) and 30% economics. The last 50 years for the DRC (ie since independence in '65)  have been a total disaster - I don't see anything changing that.As an aside - the military conflicts have been in Goma on the Eastern part of the country and have little bearing on Katanga, which is 1,000's of kms away.Good luck.",

I thought so when it was trading at CAD1,40. Plus, their incestual ownership/debt relationship with Glencore... It seems to me Glencore would like to have all of Katanga to itself.

As a result, the conventional knowledge has been that flow batteries would only compete with Lithium Ion in large power grid deployments where scale could save money, and longevity was worth more. Redflow has shown that the size argument is no longer viable.Update: The manufacturer pointed out, as added in the story above, that a 20kWh storage + 5.2kW solar costs AU$56,000. The solar system will cost roughly AU$2.20/W – $11,400 (this is higher than an average install because off grid solar costs a bit more due to extra hardware). Meaning the 20kWh of energy storage costs about $44,600 – $2,230/kWh (which is actually about USD$1730). That’s a healthy $/W installed for energy storage – however – the manufacturer makes a fine point in the above video – if you consider the levelized cost of energy over the lifetime of the hardware, you’ll find the cost per kWh of electricity provided is actually lower than a lithium ion battery pack if you account for degradation over the long term. I’d have to see further math to give an educated opinion.The main benefit that flow batteries bring to the table is their longevity. Other than hardware pieces breaking – there is no natural degradation process. These units can run at 100%, every day, for as long as you’ll be alive. In fact, per some technical reading, its actually required for best performance that the units run to 0% every few days to help manage the units over the long term. 100% after 20 years is impressive…however…if the lithium ion in Tesla’s units can get cars batteries to run for 500,000 miles, maybe the distance ahead in the longevity race is lesser than suspected.That the world’s largest under construction battery is a flow battery says that lithium ion has some competition.",

"Bloom has forever tried to market themselves as the only company that can do what they do.  They have tried to keep secret that there is another company out there that competes against them head to head.The reason I’m posting this message is to make the market aware that another company FuelCell Energy is doing the same thing but without the political backing of Gen Colin Powel, and Kleiner Perkins and selling at less than 1/10th the price of Bloom. Like Bloom, FuelCell Energy loses money but has recently stated that they have lowered their costs to the point where a run rate of 55MW – 60MW per yr would bring them to break even.In July FCEL announced that because of their expanding order pipeline, backlog of over $1.2 billion and new order wins, they are doubling their run rate from to 25MW to 55MW and adding 100 new manufacturing jobs.I admit that I am a large holder of FCEL and I’m frustrated that BLOOM is selling with a market cap of over $1.6 Billion while FCEL is selling under $130 million and winning contracts in head to head bids with Bloom.  FCEL is definitely worth more and worth a look.Two new articles this week. www.dolphin-news.com/...Second article is opening up their expanded Torrington, CT. plant giving them an expanded capacity of 100MW / yr.

Fuel cells are an energy conversion device, just like reciprocating engines or gas turbines, not a source of energy by themselves.  I can't tell you have often this error is made.The article essentially states only that subsidies via aggressive lobbying forms the basis of the Bloom Energy business model.  Not unlike many other green technologies.  But Bloom apparently elbowed other fuel cell or 'renewable' energy options out of the way.  Need to play nice with the other supplicants at the public trough.What is this company worth?  Some multiple of cash flows.

I guess my brokerage account can't do math either as they say the 88 and change I bought ABBV is up almost $10 per share now. And the puts I sold are all showing large gains as well. Yet ArnieW is buying puts and making money. I don't get it...this is a really bad stock and yet I'm still making money on long stock and short puts. I think I better listen closer to ArnieW because I'm sure I don't know what I'm doing....geez, I got a nice dividend to. I admit, I must be a moron to buy this ABBV stock.",
"Thanks for a most informative article; how about calculating an estimated present value per ABBV share for the Humira franchise? I would not be surprised if it works out to quite a tidy sum which would further justify the current valuation, even if one requires a wide equity premium say of 5%, above the 10 year.. The current earnings yield is already over 9% resulting in a generous equity premium of over 6%.",
"Today, Friday, 8/3, ABBV closes at $96.53, thus closing above its 50 day average. To all of you who bought the $90 handle or thereabouts, good for you; looks like ABBV wants to go higher. Best of luck to all.",
"Actually, apologies, as my put arithmetic is off above. Arnie, if you traded the 9/21's I suspect you bought 3.40's, is this correct? If so, I presume you sold 3.60's? Well, a winner's a winner, I guess.",
"Hi, Arnie;I assume you mean the 9/21 Puts? So, you bought 4.15s, sold 3.60s, for a gross profit of $55 per contract, before commission and fees? That's not bad.

As someone who's long the stock, I was actually encouraged by today's price action. For those who took Doc's advice and bought a $90 handle, well, they're doing OK, too, as the shares closed at $93.91 today, Wednesday, 8/1.Tell you, I'm not much of a chart/technician guy. If anyone else out there is, I'd appreciate perspective. To me, the stock is in a tug-of-war between the bearish sentiment Citron inspired, vs an earnings report that was pretty good. I'd say this: per Schwab, $93.78 was the stock's 20 day average; it took that out today. $96.32 is the stock's 50 day, $100.22 the 200 day. Barring some sort of general market cataclysm, if the stock takes out its 50 day any time soon, this should mean it's shaking off the bear channel it seems to have been in since May, and Merrill/BofA's $105 target shouldn't seem like a stretch.Option QuoteLast	3.60Day's Change	-1.04 (22.41%)Open	3.87Bid / Size	3.50 / 101Ask / Size	3.65 / 96Day's Range	3.40 - 4.15Best of luck to all.",

"This is a very cloying piece you're written here, DoctoRx.  I avoid highly leveraged companies and high beta names.  ABBV manages to combine these two traits.  However, there's speculative box I invest in separate from established businesses - biotechs with good science and interesting narratives.  Maybe the way to view ABBV is as a hybrid.  ABBV has some excellent science as witnessed by their advancing new products and, apparently, they have excellent business savy.  With most other writers, I'd take a pass but what you lay out here is intriguing.  I don't think you use the term ""mega blockbuster potential"" lightly, so if I'm willing to speculate on companies with no sales, why not speculate on one with humongous existing sales that limits the downside somewhat?

Although most of my trading positions are option related, I will in the case of ABBV purchase stock and capture the dividend income as it accrues.After a close examination of the chart time periods I follow from the 1 minute time period all the way to the Weekly chart, I have found ABBV to be a good candidate to enter a position at the present time. My analysis is based upon ""progression of price"", and recognizing price moves directionally from the small time frame charts in progression to the larger time frame charts. All of my chart indicators are signaling a recovery is underway in the stock price, with a volatility Squeeze well established on the Weekly chart, which will potentially provide a significant momentum in price activity to the upside once this indicator fires sometime in the future. When this takes place, then price will move directionally with greater than normal momentum for a period of approximately 7 - 8 weeks. My plan is to add to my position with aggressive call options once the Squeeze has fired, as this then will be a very low risk trade.",
Great company great article great author. Thx for the effort and honesty,
"DoctoRx, I am not going to be a ""chump"" for ABBV, that you are getting praise for from the honest retirees who make up a large percentage of these threads.I do see the soft peddling of ABBV's problems.The market will sift through the problems. like the tender offer lawsuit finance.yahoo.com/...",
"I learned about the company from a co-worker who""s wife is employed by ABT.  I started managing my portfolio recently and have been watching ABT/ABBV for a while on a few blogs.  I finally initiated a position today for about 5 % of the total.  I felt your article  it was an excellent read, and confirmed at least for me, I bought in at a good time.Thanks",
"Thank you for your article, Doc. Management is going to have to be very upfront and transparent about Humira’s lifecycle with analysts and shareholders.  Otherwise, the weak hands are going to sell with abandon at the first whiff, and subsequent dire forecasts, of decelerating sales.I’m long ABBV, but may trade around my position.  I don’t like to do that, but it may be prudent to protect my profits.  We’ll see how the conferences and earnings calls are handled.",
"To DoctoRx (and others providing commentary), I'm just curious ... we're very suddenly buying with vigor, buying aggressively, accumulating seriously ... but I don't find any context given as to what proportion of  total holdings you are expending, or targeting, and perhaps to the exclusion of what other choices.  it's not like we're all sitting around with piles of loose cash, waiting to to throw it at spontaneous Alpha recommendations.I'm still working on the diversification of my retirement portfolio, and it happens to include 3.6% ABBV at today's $91.45 close, but I'd like to hear how much ""risk"" you intend to allocate to this single holding.  If it was present the article, and I missed it, I do apologize.  Thanks in advance.",
"Thanks for the article, I appreciate the point of view.ABBV was one of the first stocks I invested in post retirement, some number of years ago. As it went up, I sold off shares at ~$91 and then at ~$121 - which I looked at as a gift; a moon shot that ought to have been faded; so, I did. My remaining ABBV position is largely 'house money'. I am content to let it ride.You know, as I have come to learn, biotechs are wonky beasts. I've shared my opinion re CELG before. After having got clocked, I recently re-established exposure near lows, and sold it for a decent gain. But, prior to that? Ouch! My point in raising CELG; I thought that company had it all; a diversified pipeline in promising fields, a good approach to partnerships and risk sharing. Then, the problems began, culminating with an FDA 'refusal to file'; if CELG hasn't become the  latest poster child for the gang that couldn't shoot straight, I don't know what.So, I use my CELG experience in how I view ABBV. Any stock has its share of risks; the inverse of risk is opportunity. As far as I recollect, ABBV was 'born' in its ABT spin-off as a one trick Humira pony. Ever since, ABBV's management has pursued two strategic goals, as far as I can see; protect the Humira franchise/IP in order to extend and preserve the earnings power of the franchise, and then to diversify into other drugs.Along the way, ABBV has had a few challenges; what name hasn't? My take is that most of the bad news is 'known'. Therefore, the risk in ABBV translates to monetizing its pipeline. In a fundamental sense, ABBV seems to have done a very credible job defending Humira. As to the diversification goal, it's hard for me, as a layman, to confidently assess their prospects. My impression is that they've been doing OK. Put it this way, the last earnings call seemed positive, and reading the earnings call transcript, while it's hard to get a feel for 'tone', I saw nothing that left me with the impression ABBV management is not confident in their approach.From a more near term, technical perspective, I can only say that the stock seems to be having a problem sustaining a rally. Ever since it made highs in May ~$105, it seems to be in a bear channel. Someone above - not even Arnie - noted the name should hold $90, or else, look out. Well, OK. I'm not so much of a technician, but respect technical views when it comes to assessing status.  Prior to Citron's note, I thought the low $90's was a good place for new money to establish exposure to ABBV. Now, I'm of the view that it'll pay to wait and see. Over the long term, though, I think the odds favor ABBV, so I'll stay long, and look to add opportunistically.Best of luck to all.",

"Another solid article by DocRx!  I've been slowly moving more of my positions into Pharma and Biotech, and I believe ABBV is a solid choice, with some real downstream possibilities.   So much razzle dazzle for the top tech names, later or sooner...we all need healthcare and the products that help make it possible.  At 4% divvie, we can afford to be patient and let events unfold over time.

Of course, it's all about the Benjamins, but every once in a while I just kinda shake my head...",

"Doc - thanks for the article. I still insist no one does it better than you in this sector. I sold two-thirds of my ABBV holdings at $121.50 when it was a little over a double for me. I will put it on my watch list again for adding to my smaller position based on your opinion/analysis. Best,Bob",
Doc -Thanks for sharing your thoughtswith us.Al,
Excellent article including a number of very salient points!,
I entered heavy at $88.70 prepared to defend below that level,
"Doc, thank you for (another) well written article. I'm your follower and always enjoy reading your articles (regardless if I follow your advise). As opposed to what you very kindly labeled  the (laughable)   ""Citron thesis"" , your article given us the DETAILED support for your  conclusion. Citron ""Research""  on the other hand conclude that ABBV is going to $60 in twelve month. Based on what? why not $30, $40... where are the NUMBERS to support the ""Thesis""?Unfortunately In the new world of algo trading  Citron can be  ""powerful and usually right"" (lol) , even a tweet pre-market  can wipe fortunes from investors,  people who will not bother reading (and understanding) ""long"" articles like yours or listen to management presentation!I hope you (or Andrew Left) will help us understand how he calculate the $60 so we can make our own conclusion! In the meantime, I took the (golden) opportunity to go long at ~$90",
"Thank you Doc. I struck ABBV on the 24th. Gobbled up some around the low of the day at $88.24. I've built up a nice position this year and will probably stand pat for awhile. It's like the Buffett saying, ""Be greedy when others are fearful.""",
"Hi DocAgree with you on ABBVTake a look at a spec,trading,or long term play with----------$TRXCThanks,Bob",
"Doc, I am with you, bought initial small position at $88.7. I wonder how ABBV stacks up against CELG today, in your (always very humble!) opinion? (CELG is still being my biggest position, my sentiment about it has soured recently...)",
I feel sorry for poor consumers who are forced to pay absurd retail prices to give the channel fat imaginary margins to justify the absurdly high drug coverage costs Americans have to pay insurance companies to afford medications they need to live on. This needs to be resolved preferably sooner than later. The drug makers and developers may not suffer because they aren't getting paid the current pricing for the drugs anyways. It is a health insurance game not a drug company game to make money.,
"Excellent article!I really enjoyed the commentary on ABBV. Wonder why I ever got away from it except that it was hard for me to understand future viability. This investor once again is looking at reducing the size of a JNJ position given legal issues on multiple fronts. Also I have sold much of an earlier REGN purchase with an 80 point per share gain, though I probably left points on the table.At 10x forward earnings ABBV reflects an amount of risk to its business in the valuation. A major research firm puts FMV at $97 so a slight discount. I will put ABBV on my watch list and thanks again for the operational assessment.",
"I would be seriously buying as well, if not for the enormous amount of net debt. If you pull out debt repayments from your projections, the potential returns do not look nearly as attractive.",
"DoctoRx:Thank you for another well-reasoned article. Always worthwhile to read your work. ""A pleasure doing business with you,"" as we used to say in the old neighborhood.My two cents: I'm adding to my long position. ABBV is a 1-to-3 year total-return play. If all goes well, your 15%-ish annual return notion looks reasonable; if not, sell it and move on to something else.Cheers,Capt. Spaulding",
"The stocks Citron targets can attract a tremendous amount of short-sellers in a concerted, protracted bear raid. Take a look at Mallinkrodt trading at sub 2 p/e as an example. ABBV is significantly larger than MNK ever was, I'm not sure how successful he'll be here. It might be prudent to wait until the dust settles before buying any stock in the short-term, though.",
Thank you for your well developed analysis of ABBV . Now I am more enthusiastic holding this healthcare stock for the longer term.,
I'm interested. Price better be staying over $90 line or it's a long way down.,
Thank you for another very excellent thoughtful article filled with facts.Amazing to get it under $90 and even up to $96 with 4% dividend yield that most likely will really only get BETTER !!!It is currently trading below that and I say a strong Buy !and I am. Long ABBV for at least 5 years steady and pleased.Best and Happy Investing :)) Rose,
"Thanks for your article and pov.  Long abt labs many, many years...would love to add more but maybe at a lower price.  Market still seems to want to reward tech at the expense of everything else.

This is a very nice well developed article (that covers all significant points) on ABBV.  I have owned ABBV for about 20 years (most of the time when it was part of ABT).  Since the spin off from ABT I have added modestly to my position in ABBV which I plan to continue in the future.  Its dividend has been quite high for a pharmaceutical. Thank you for this posting.,
Conformational bias for me. Thanks for the write-up. Adding on dips.,
"I appreciate the 'conclusion' at the end of the article.  Far too many articles just list a bunch of details without any summation at the end.  Well done, Doc.",
Thanks for the article. Two points. Ibrutinib appears somewhat vulnerable because of acalabrutinib's possible advantages though it is early. Patients who are doing well may be sticky to remain with Humira but insurance companies call the shots sticky or not.,
"Very nice, Doc. I agree with your thesis, and bought back into ABBV last week with a small no. of shares. I will probably double that soon. There is not use understanding Citron, I don't think, except 'we want to make a short-term killing.'I am generally under caution and holding off 'non-exceptional' purchases (ABBV qualifies as exceptional) in part because of presentations like Kirk Spano's latest podcast on factors leading to a possible correction later this year (or sooner). He makes some excellent points on buybacks, insider sales, and end to quantitative easing, etc. Still, ABBV is one stock that I will buy when/if selling others. Thanks again.",
"Thanks for the article. I like ABBV. Reckon it's good for about 10% growth a year for many years to come, plus the 4% divi yield, plus another (roughly) 2% net buyback yield.Obviously regulatory risk, but already baked into the low price in my view (and if it goes lower it would soon grow its way back out again).Only slight concern is the debt load, but again it's growing its way out of it.",

"GeorgeThank you for the amaizing hystory of First Solar, Abound and ColoradoI was not aware of any of the above.I am an old man. All I can say from the moral side, when my granchildrens health is threatened, I want to err way/way on the conservative side, when it comes to toxic materialsKeep up the good work Z",
"GeorgeI did not realize that First Solar does not sell into the distributed market. Near my place in the US, I know they have installed a small field for a hospital.I also note your confidence in the utilities with skepticism Of course your comments about real estate resale are most appropriate.Since you are a technical person, let me raise an other more subtle issue with CdTe. Since the material is strongly water-soluble, in case a panel cracks, the water penetrates the module and by capillary action, travels the whole area of the module, the dissolved CdTe can spill out of the panel, getting into the soil. Simiilar problem exist with the water-soluble toxic provskites also.I swear by a few principles in my continued renewable energy quest i) never use any toxic materials ii) for PV thin films avoid water-soluble materials iii) any product, (note batteries) must have over 10,000 deep discharge cycles, to be able to guarantee your system for Main streetat least 30 yearsBe well, Z",
"Zoltan,I do not think that there is any danger of FSLR CdTe panels dumped somewhere. It is because First Solar only sells to Power Plant developers not to residential custommers.So far there are no FSLR pannels installed on any residential roofs.I personally would have no fear of getting cancer from FSLR pannels installed on my roof.But I would never have FSLR panels installed on my roof in the first place, because I would surely have a problem reselling my house.My real estate broker would surely need to disclose in writing that the solar panels on my roof contain Cadmium declared to be a CARCINOGENIC in all 50 US states.Does anybody thinks that potential buyers of my house would start researching whether Cd is soluble in water or not?No, they would run away and buy another house.For that reason alone, FSLR CdTe panels will never be sold to residential markets.I also doubt that FSLR panels would ever be sold in the ""Distributed"" markets either, since these are the roofs of the Department Stores, Industrial and Office Parks etc. where people could be exposed.So there is no danger that FSLR panels will be dumped somewhere. Installations are only in the solar Power Plants and utilities would never do that.",
"1luckyschmuckyThank you for  your appropriate comment.I do hope that rules in place will prevent the First Solar CdTe modules ending up in the landfills and  in our fresh-water tablesThe world we live in is recinding even more important environmental protection, The best defence would be only to use non toxic PV materials. Lets start at Seeking Alpha the promotion of a socially responsible investment programs. It is possible to be profitable, while helping the common good",

"Mr Fthenakis arguments discounting the health effects of carcinogenic CdTe has been discarded when originally published. Here I just want to quote two issues of facts that any of you can check; 1) much of the Fthenakis arguments are based on the statements, that CdTe is not water-soluble. If in solution, the Cd and Te ions are separate not acting like CdTe solid. CdTe is highly water-soluble in both acidic and base water ( on either side of distilled water).2) much is made of First Solar recycling the CdTe modules. In their latest recycling statements, the cost of dismounting is left to the owners and they will only recycle modules brought to them. The dismounting of aging rusted modules costs more, then mounting of new modules, and the customers are unlikely to spend the funds to disassemble the aged modules and they will end up in landfills and entering the water-tables.We have to become socially concious investors, and value the generation following us more, than todays profit.The issue is not to compare use of CdTe to coal burning, but to select a PV material that does not polluteThe water solubility causes further problem, of letting in any crack in the glass the moisture to ge in and it travels within the two pieces of glass by capillary action until the module can fall apart",
Where is the proof?,
"Shareholders Unite; an other one of your well written pieces.But please do tell me, how can you write a full article, without calling to attention the carcinogenic, poisonous watersoluble nature of the CdTe material. First Solar already installed enough material, if distributed uniformly would be sufficient to poison the complete fresh water supply of the US. The CdTe technology can be substituted with lower cost, higher efficiency non toxic material. Why take the risk? Is this the world we live in? No global warming, no poisoning by Cd?God save us all",
"Meanwhile, battery prices keep falling every year, and not just a little bit.  We may be at or very near the inflection point when batteries+solar becomes competitive in many more locations.  Batteries will be dramatically cheaper in the years ahead.",

"""The company has debt of $456M.""  Which is all short term project related.  I believe their guidance on profits for 2018 is a bit pessimistic. Many questions that arose during the past couple of quarters were answered with positives.  Certification was one, production expansion progress was another, and the effect of the China policy was the biggie. If both operational Series 6 plants can get close to nameplate capacity, and Vietnam has a successful rollout before the end of the year, they could easily beat on the earnings for the year.  Next year should be a blockbuster year with close to or over 5G online and much of their cap ex in the rearview mirror.  By this time next year they will easily be sold out into 2021 with production levels much, much higher.  Meanwhile, their competition is struggling to break even with highly leveraged balance sheets, trying to dump excess production into protected markets.  It will be ugly in the solar sector, for everyone else but FSLR.",

The only thing I would like to hear more news about is the effifiency ratings of Series 6 and the forecast. Can they get to like 20% efficiency soon to better fight the mono perc panels?

"from G&M:What’s next for Aimia after Aeroplan sale?SUSAN KRASHINSKY ROBERTSON MEDIA AND MARKETING REPORTERINCLUDES CLARIFICATIONPUBLISHED AUGUST 21, 2018UPDATED 5 HOURS AGOFOR SUBSCRIBERSAimia Inc. exists because of Aeroplan – which was spun off from Air Canada in 2005 as Groupe Aeroplan Inc., and renamed Aimia in 2011. Despite the company’s efforts over the years to expand beyond that frequent-flier program, today Aeroplan still represents the bulk of its business. Now, with a $450-million deal in place to sell the program to a consortium led by Air Canada, what becomes of Aimia?Should the deal go through, Aimia will offload the driving force of its largest division. The Coalitions segment of the business, of which Aeroplan is the biggest part, accounted for $712.6-million, or 91 per cent of Aimia’s revenues, in the first half of this year. In the second quarter alone, Aeroplan represented 85 per cent of the company’s revenue.Aimia, which was created within Air Canada in 1984, has scaled down its current structure compared to just a few years ago. In 2011, when it rebranded as Aimia, then-chief executive Rupert Duchesne said in a statement that the new name reflected the company’s global identity: ""As competitors try to position themselves to take advantage of the burgeoning international market for loyalty management services, we are already well positioned as the established experts,” the statement said. “A single, explicit global brand clearly reaffirms this privileged position.”By late 2015, Aimia was pulling back on its global expansion, shedding “non-core” businesses and vowing to refocus. It announced the closure of the Nectar loyalty program in Italy that year, and in 2017 it sold businesses in New Zealand and the United States. Earlier this year, it sold the U.K. Nectar business to British retail operator J Sainsbury PLC, which had been Aimia’s partner in the program, for $105-million; significantly less than the roughly $755-million Aimia paid for Nectar’s parent company in 2007.Aside from Aeroplan, the Coalition segment also includes a 48.9-per-cent interest in PLM Premier S.A.P.I. de C.V. (which operates Mexico’s leading frequent-flier program, Club Premier, jointly owned and operated with Grupo Aeromexico S.A.B. de C.V.) and a 20-per-cent equity stake in Think Big Digital Sdn Bhd (which owns and operates the Big loyalty program for Philippines AirAsia Inc. and its parent company, Tune Group Sdn Bhd). In July, Aimia rejected a $180-million offer from Aeromexico to buy out its stake in PLM. This segment is also the only part of Aimia that made money in the first half of 2018, with $28.9-million in operating income.The other major part of Aimia is its Insights & Loyalty Solutions segment, which provides loyalty services for other companies. It designs and implements loyalty programs for clients, provides strategy for those programs, conducts campaigns, and provides data analytics, among other services. This segment also includes the Air Miles Middle East program. It reported $69.3-million in revenue in the six months ended June 30, and an operating loss of $32.7-million, a loss that widened from $19.5-million in the same period the previous year.“We continue to transition clients onto more platform-based solutions and we remain focused on reducing operating costs in this business to better align the cost base to the changing shape of the business,” Aeroplan spokesperson Christa Poole said in an e-mail when asked for context on the segment’s losses.Finally, the ""Other Businesses” segment includes a number of businesses that Aimia has sold recently. Remaining in this segment are a roughly 20-per-cent stake in Cardlytics Inc. and roughly 5 per cent in Fractal Analytics Inc. – both are marketing analytics companies.As of the second quarter, Aimia had $329.8-million in long-term debt on its books; some of the proceeds from the sale of Aeroplan would likely be directed there. Once Aeroplan is gone, what would be the fate of the rest of the company?On Aimia’s second-quarter earnings call earlier this month, chief executive Jeremy Rabe said that the company would have ""a number of options” if a transaction with Air Canada occurred. In response to a question, he acknowledged that a wind-up of the company was one option.""Should a definitive agreement be reached, we will articulate our plans for the remaining business and the assets we will retain,” Ms. Poole said in an e-mail. ""In the meantime, the business continues to operate as normal.”",
Any thoughts on the stock price today?Given Mittlemen common share NAV of $7.50 it seems like there is a disconnect between the prefs and Mittlemen valuation of the common shares.Anyone that wants to over allocate to Aimia common stock in their portfolio could short the prefs as the upside is pretty much capped.,
Does anyone know Rabe's pay structure as far as options go? Im unable to locate it.Mittleman did a fantastic job with this situation overall and I don't think he's going to wind things down the way the PR was worded yesterday.  Perhaps his standstill agreement forced him to agree with the board on the $450 buyout.  Or perhaps he wants to use Aimia as a tax advantaged investing vehicle ala Blue Chips stamps.  Or perhaps shareholders vote this down....  Every time we get some answers it brings on more questions!:)  But overall this continue to look like a promising situation.,
"Another interesting scenario to contemplate is what happens if shareholders vote no to this deal? Would Air Canada walk or pay more? My bet is they'd pay more, especially when Air Canada stock is up 7.5% on this news. They could issue shares to buy Aeroplan and get it for free.",
"In no way do I dispute that Mittleman was directionally correct in his letter/analysis and that he was correct in asserting that Aeroplan had real value to AC.  All good.But if you compare these comments (see below) provided on Aug. 6 (just two weeks ago) to the outcome announced today -- there is a GIANT disconnect...far more than just concessions to an initial negotiating position.  Either he learned something new (which would be important to know) or he is a hype machine and his analysis should be discounted accordingly, including his most recent sum of the parts analysis.  Full disclosure -- I still hold my position with no immediate intention to sell as of today.Here is the ""best of"" from Mittleman.  So confident, so aggressive...what happened?""I can find no example of a major coalition loyalty program changing hands for less than 10x EBITDA in the past 20 years; why should Aeroplan be the first?In writing to my clients about Aimia, I have used a very conservative value of C$1B for Aeroplan, which was quoted in the press recently.  But that valuation is based on my most conservative estimate of C$100M in EBITDA post-2020 on a standalone basis, and not reflective of any control premium.  The strategic value of Aeroplan is clearly much greater than its stand-alone value to Aimia.If Aimia cannot obtain at least the stand-alone value of Aeroplan, C$1B, plus a modest control premium of 20%, then I'd prefer Aimia not sell it.  Air Canada cannot on one hand claim that its non-existent loyalty program will have an NPV of C$2B, but then on the other hand claim that Aeroplan's well-established, FCF-generating, 5M member giant is worth less than C$1B.Aeroplan likely has strategic value well above our C$1B minimum estimate in that its 5M+ members and its key commercial contracts occupy a critical role at the nexus of a very valuable economic ecosystem involving TD Bank, CIBC, Visa, Amex Canada, and Air Canada, which have hundreds of millions of annual profits at stake in preserving it.I can only advise the Board, not dictate to it, but I hope I've shown here that it is obvious that Aimia should not accept less than C$1B net for its core asset, especially not with a gun held to its head by its key commercial partners, for whom Aeroplan has been such a tremendously productive partner for so many years.  Gerry Schwartz of Onex was clearly right to describe Aeroplan as ""the gem within Air Canada""Since Aeroplan is clearly a superior business, it cannot be worth less than the valuation at which Air Canada itself trades today in the open market, which at C$23.73, is an EV/EBITDA of 5x (adding pension liability), and market cap. to FCF of 11x.  Aeroplan at those multiples would be about C$1.2B.""",
"New to this story -- have been doing research over the past week.  So I'm far from a expert on Aimia.Bought shares yesterday (not many) based on the implied discount to IV, the likelihood of AC coming back to the table, and the presence of a large shareholder to protect shareholder interests.  -Got lucky re the timing but expected AC would have to pay a higher price based on the analysis provided by large shareholders (e.g., Mittleman) and others on Seeking Alpha.Here is my question:I reread the Mittleman letter and the updated Mittleman statement today.MIttleman's updated IV estimate of $5.75 seems about right -- seemingly no big/unrealistic assumptions to get to that number.WIth that said -- it IMPOSSIBLE to reconcile Mittleman's original letter with his updated comments today.  What could have he learned between the writing of that letter and the deal today?  Or is he just full of it -- hyping his position?",

"We can convincingly answer the title of this article: Aimia.When I first started considering buying shares I quickly saw that Aeroplan could survive and do well without the same type of special arrangement they have always had with AC. The credit cards are the major driver, and buying flights at a discount is not that hard. It even improves the value as Rabe has said. I didn't expect much beyond that.This has been a threat to AC since it could send a lot of cashflow and customers to their competitors. Now it just got a lot worse. Aeroplan is on the way to building close partnerships with every airline in Canada other than AC/WJ that effectively makes it a combined official frequent flyer program for all of them. It will also send significant numbers of customers to every other airline that operates internationally.The fact that someone can earn Aeroplan points on Porter flights and use them for a vacation with Air Transat turns up the heat on AC. They even got a discount airline (Flair) which I was expecting to operate without any form of rewards program. The total revenue may be relatively small for the airlines but the added profit could be significant. The added traffic and profits could easily allow these airlines to expand on routes AC relies on.I have a feeling that the next time Air Canada comes calling, Aimia will answer ""Oh, that $450 million price? That was before we signed all of those deals"".",

"Mittleman speaks publicly for first time about Aeroplan takeover attempt:SUBSCRIBELOG INADCHOICESAimia’s largest shareholder calls Air Canada’s bid for Aeroplan a ‘shock and awe’ tacticTIM KILADZEPUBLISHED 2 HOURS AGOUPDATED AUGUST 6, 2018The largest shareholder of Aimia Inc. has fired back at Air Canada and its three financial partners, calling their recent takeover bid for the Aeroplan loyalty program “blatantly inadequate” and arguing that the business is worth between $1-billion and $2-billion.“I applaud the board for not acquiescing and continuing negotiations,” Christopher Mittleman, the chief investment officer of New York-based Mittleman Brothers LLC, wrote in a five-page letter after Aimia rejected the consortium’s bid late last week. The investment firm called the takeover strategy a “’shock and awe’ tactic designed to incite panic and anchor expectations to an absurd level.”The letter is the first public statement from Mittleman Brothers, which is Aimia’s largest investor with a 17.6-per-cent stake, since Air Canada teamed up with Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Visa Canada Corp. on an offer for Aeroplan on July 25. The opposition of such a large shareholder to the sale of Aimia’s most important asset will make it more difficult for the consortium to complete a deal at a price similar to what it has offered, although Aimia said last week it will keep the door open to offers.STORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENTThe Air Canada-led group originally bid $250-million in cash for Aeroplan, whose members collect points and redeem them for flights and other rewards. After a week of negotiations, the group raised its offer to $325-million, but late on Thursday, hours before the bid was set to expire, Aimia walked away, later disclosing that it wanted $450-million and a different set of conditions.Mittleman Brothers, which has two seats on Aimia’s board and helped install Jeremy Rabe as Aimia’s chief executive officer in May, is now publicly demanding at least double Aimia’s counteroffer.“The strategic value of Aeroplan [to the bidding partners] is clearly much greater than its stand-alone value to Aimia,” Mr. Mittleman wrote. “Thus, a compromise between what it’s worth to Aimia, at certainly no less than $1-billion, and what it’s worth to the consortium, at $2-billion-plus, seems reasonable.”If no such offer is forthcoming, he wrote, Aimia should carry on with its new strategy.That strategy includes pivoting away from Air Canada and allowing Aeroplan members to redeem their miles for seats on any airline. Aeroplan is also in the process of signing on new preferred partners. The company announced a deal on Friday with Toronto-based Porter Airlines that takes effect in 2020, when Aeroplan’s contract with Air Canada ends. Last week, Aeroplan also touted the potential for an arrangement with the Oneworld airline alliance, whose members include British Airways, American Airlines and Cathay Pacific.In the letter, Mr. Mittleman took issue with the way the bidders used Aimia’s $2-billion redemption liability – the estimated future cost of flights and other rewards for the billions of Aeroplan points that exist – as a negotiating tactic. The bidders tried to add this amount to the offer price, claiming their original bid was worth $2.25-billion.“I can find no precedent where it was treated as a charge to enterprise value in similar M&A transactions,” Mr. Mittleman wrote. He noted that when Air Canada purchased Canadian Airlines in 1999, the points liability for Canadian’s loyalty program was not factored into the price.STORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENTThe bidders, it seems, have seized on the fear that Aeroplan members will rush to redeem their miles before Air Canada’s contract with Aeroplan expires in 2020, thus creating a rush of cash out the door for Aimia. MR. Mittleman, however, argued that “even during the 2003 bankruptcy [court filing] of Air Canada, there was no run on the bank.”Aimia currently has about $530-million in cash to cover the liability. Mr. Mittleman argues that over the next two years, internal cash flow plus a potential sale of Aimia’s 49-per-cent stake in Mexico’s leading loyalty program would more than double the reserve ratio to 66 per cent. (Aeromexico recently offered to buy Aimia’s stake, but was turned down.)As for Aeroplan’s value, Mr. Mittleman said that when Air Canada announced in May, 2017, that it would not renew its Aeroplan contract in 2020, the airline said it would build an in-house loyalty program that would create a value of $2-billion to the company − many times what the consortium offered for Aeroplan.One analyst recently estimated TD and CIBC now make more than $400-million combined annually from the Aeroplan program, through issuing Aeroplan credit cards.“Aeroplan is the lynchpin in the nexus of this powerful network, where TD, CIBC, Visa, Amex, and Air Canada generate hundreds of millions in net profits annually from their Aeroplan card holders,” Mr. Mittleman argued. He compared the group to “school yard bullies, trying to force a smaller kid to give them his bicycle.”Mr. Mittleman wrote that he recently received calls from other shareholders who collectively own an estimated 20 per cent of Aimia and noted these investors “largely concur with my own views.”STORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENTIf true, it has implications for the bidding consortium’s next move. One option is for Air Canada and its partners to launch a hostile takeover bid for all of Aimia. Should that happen, they would likely need to win approval from two-thirds of all shareholders to proceed.Air Canada did not respond to a request for comment.",
"On the Porter Airlines deal, I can see AC being very upset with this deal. It seems like the history between Porter and AC is already very strained, as described in this article: business.financialpost.com/...Having flown the Montreal-Toronto suttle route several times on Porter and AC, I can attest that the experience on both airlines is exactly the same (same planes, same terminal). The last few times have all been on AC simply because Aeroplan points were available to redeem for those flights. I imagine that this is a very predictable part of AC's domestic business (same number of daily flights, same number expected passengers since most are business passengers). Also, my experience is that the flights are rarely full, which would suggest that there is spare capacity for Aeroplan members and that Porter would be happy to sell seats at a deep discount (if only so that those passengers don't fly on AC). I cannot imagine that AC would be happy at all to have that part of the business potentially upended some more by Porter.",
"Mittleman's open letter to the Aimia Board, www.mittlemanbrothers.com/...""In my opinion, the offer for Aeroplan from the Air Canada-TD-CIBC-Visa consortium was misleading, coercive, and blatantly inadequate...""How about this pearl:""Air Canada cannot on one hand claim that its non-existent loyalty program will have an NPV of C$2B, but then on the other hand claim that Aeroplan’s well-established, FCF-generating, 5M member giant is worth less than C$1B. And for Air Canada to claim their offer was “generous” at a premium to the recent trading price, after they were much to blame for the recent low trading price given their May 11, 2017 announcement saw Aimia’s share price drop 63% that day, is absurd, and the short fuse expiration of the offer, clearly coercive. Also, TD was called out by Aimia CFO Grafton on the Q1 2018 results conference call for significantly reducing promotional spending on the card since June 2017, apparently, as we now see, in advance of trying to buy Aeroplan on the cheap. While I’m not qualified to opine on questions of legality, the pattern of behaviors here is disconcerting to say the least. I hope that will change now.""",
“the new CEO was just starting to turn the loyalty program away from Air Canada when the bid was made public.”Cause and effect,
"How Air Canada’s approach failed to land AeroplanTIM KILADZEPUBLISHED AUGUST 3, 2018UPDATED AUGUST 3, 2018FOR SUBSCRIBERSAfter a week spent swapping counteroffers, it came down to an ultimatum.When the markets closed on Thursday afternoon, officials at Aimia Inc. were nowhere close to accepting an offer for their Aeroplan loyalty program from a group that included Air Canada, two major banks and one credit-card firm.The group, which launched a $250-million bid for the Aeroplan business on July 25, had agreed to increase the price to $325-million and change some other terms. At a meeting late Thursday in a Bay Street office tower, Air Canada and its partners decided to turn up the pressure, according to a source familiar with the talks. You’ve got 32 minutes to give us a ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ the group said to Aimia representatives – and no more negotiating fine details.A half-hour later, Aimia walked away, leaving the fate of one of Canada’s most popular loyalty plans up in the air.Air Canada and its partners – Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Visa Canada Corp. – have not indicated what their next move will be. Aimia took the highly unusual step of disclosing that it had asked for $450-million during the negotiations.In the meantime, it is pressing forward with its own restructuring plan, which includes trying to find new partners. Earlier in the week, the company confirmed that it is in talks with the Oneworld airline alliance, whose members include British Airways, American Airlines and Cathay Pacific, and on Friday it announced a deal with Porter Airlines Inc. The arrangement will allow those flying Porter to collect Aeroplan points and Aeroplan members to use their points to book tickets on the airline, beginning in July, 2020.While Porter is small relative to Air Canada, it flies on crucial routes along the eastern corridor – particularly between Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal – that are attractive to business travelers and are dominated by Air Canada flights.Aimia shares jumped another 8 per cent on Friday, bringing their total rise to 50 per cent since the Air Canada group’s bid.In its battle against the unsolicited offer, Aimia is fighting against a rich history. Air Canada built Aeroplan as its in-house loyalty program in 1984, then spun it out in a 2005 initial public offering.Aimia grew as an independent company – but then suffered a devastating blow last year when Air Canada said it would pull out of the companies’ partnership in 2020. For Aeroplan members, the ability to redeem points for Air Canada flights is by far the most important reason to belong to the loyalty program.The playing field in this takeover battle appears lopsided. Air Canada has teamed up with two of Canada’s largest lenders and also brought along the country’s largest credit card company. The four titans hold immense power, and they have huge balance sheets, which they argued could easily absorb Aimia’s $2-billion redemption liability – the estimated future cost of flights and other rewards for the billions of Aeroplan points that exist.Aimia, meanwhile, had been struggling to figure out its future. The Aeroplan business has always been heavily dependent on Air Canada, and the relationship matters so much to Aimia that when the airline announced that it would let their contract expire, Aimia’s stock fell 63 per cent in a single day.Amid the resulting turmoil, Aimia is on its third chief executive in 13 months. While it now has stable leadership in Jeremy Rabe, who started in May, the new CEO was just starting to turn the loyalty program away from Air Canada when the bid was made public.To win investors over, Aimia has used the consortium’s hardball tactics against it. By revealing that it brought its asking price for Aeroplan to $450-million, it made it clear that Aimia really was trying to make a deal happen.“We have a number of shareholders who are frankly upset that we offered a number that low,” Mr. Rabe said on a conference call Friday morning. “We think that was a very reasonable number – perhaps too reasonable.”Meanwhile, an Aimia shareholder expressed exasperation at Air Canada’s final bid. “We’re scratching our heads as to why the offer is so low.""With the Porter announcement, Aimia has also demonstrated that it is not necessarily doomed without its current Air Canada contract. The company also confirmed that the revamped Aeroplan will allow members to book seats on any airline, which some members prefer, and is dangling the potential for still more new partnerships.Those developments put the $2-billion redemption liability in a new light. While Air Canada and its partners want investors to believe it will sink Aimia, which currently has about $530-million in cash to cover it, the liability is troubling only if Aeroplan members rush to cash in their miles before the Air Canada contract expires.After Aimia reported quarterly earnings Friday morning, RBC Dominion Securities analyst Drew McReynolds noted the latest numbers suggest there are “no signs of meaningful changes to member behaviour at Aeroplan.”Now Air Canada must play defence. On Bay Street, there are questions swirling as to why the airline apparently reversed course on building its own in-house loyalty program and sought to reacquire Aeroplan instead.It is possible that building from scratch is harder than Air Canada anticipated. Banking sources have noted that most potential financial partners are already tied to an existing travel rewards plan, which could affect a potential credit card deal for Air Canada.In an e-mailed statement, Air Canada rejected these theories. “The reality is that Aimia’s business plans are precarious at best, given their liquidity outlook,” said a spokesperson for the airline, adding that “there remains significant interest from numerous [credit card] partners.”TD and CIBC declined to comment for this story. Visa could not be reached for comment.While talks have broken off, Aimia’s CEO stressed on Friday that it would come back to the table and have a “constructive dialogue.”Whether that ever happens remains to be seen. If it doesn’t, everyone involved will have to find a way to get along: Air Canada remains an Aeroplan partner for two more years, while TD and CIBC, which issue Aeroplan credit cards, are tied to the program until 2024.",
"I interpreted Rabe is comment as simply meaning when talks go south, it's possible to become frustrated and even bitter, and you can be tempted to lash back at the other party. But you have contractual obligations, so you have to put those feelings aside. I doubt it's TD who is holding back the deal. More likely Air Canada in my opinion.",
"Was pressure from TD the reason behind Aimia's low asking price of $450 million?I noticed a curious quote from Jeremy Rabe in Aimia's Thursday night update on the acquisition discussions.  ""It is business as usual for Aeroplan and we expect all of the companies in the Current Partner Consortium to honour their long standing contractual obligations including issuing and redeeming members' miles.""Why mention consortium contractual obligations?  Who would expect a major Canadian bank to renege on a long term contract?  Then, Friday, TD sent an email to its Aeroplan card holders. Here's a section of that email:""We have sought, but not received, assurances from Aimia that the Aeroplan Program will deliver the value that we and you, as a TD Aeroplan credit cardholder, would expect from Aimia in the long term. TD recently participated in a proposal by Air Canada, TD and other interested parties to buy the Aeroplan Program. After engaging in extensive discussions with Aimia, the proposal, enhanced from the original offer, would have provided the best outcome for all Aeroplan members. TD believed that the proposed transaction, if completed, would have provided value and continuity to TD Aeroplan credit cardholders. We're disappointed Aimia rejected this proposal and we're now evaluating next steps.""A quick comment on the assurances sought by TD.  It doesn't matter what they expect in terms of value;  Aimia is only required to abide by the terms and conditions of the signed agreement.  If there are loopholes large enough to drive a truck through, TD only have themselves to blame for signing the contract.",
SA has the transcript: seekingalpha.com/...Nice of them to post it so quickly!,
"If the stock had fallen dramatically today due to the earnings or AC + friends deal not happening it would have given AC a stronger negotiating position.  Given the strength of the stock and the Porter news I think that enhances Aimia's bargaining position which is great for shareholder and very surprised to be honest that AC + Friends have not accepted the $450M as that is a steal for them especially with all the synergies and very soon if a OneWorld agreement is announced that ship for AC will have sailed.   I am torn as part of me wants to see the deal would help the stock in the short term but the other part of me sees the value of Aimia closer in line to what Mittleman values it at which means it will take a few years but potentially a higher valuation (with more risk of course as well) but obvious the new management team is FINALLY totally aligned with shareholders and has the ""smarts"" to execute on a plan if they move in that direction.",
"Any one listen to the CC? What is it Chris Mittleman who called in and voiced his displeasure at the 450 M number for Aeroplan, thinking that it was too low... And did you get the feeling that Rabe himself though the number was too low...he made the comment of the number being ""more than reasonable"". I wonder what the Board saw that made them take this number...",
"When you're long, you're strong.Disclosure: I am long GAPFF",
It is SO obvious to see the difference of extremely strong management and kudos to Rabe and Mittleman team to navigate the delicate situation of the hostile (low ball) offer from AC and they seemed two steps ahead the entire way from clearly communicating with the market (ahead of AC and their spin) and developing back up strategies (Porter/Charter/OneWorld) etc.No doubt Aimia is finally being run by adult supervision :-) and my take is AC and friends have a short window to agree to the $450M (which is still an extremely good deal as I believe 700-800M is fair value) and the fact that even with an average Q and not agreeing to AC terms the stock has opened strong today says alot.,

Long AIMIA.,
"As an Aeroplan customer I see things differently.A redemption run seems unlikely with flights, since the most popular ones are sold out just from regular activity. It's possible that members will choose really bad flights, pay much higher levels of points for good flights, choose non-flight redemptions, or abandon their points. But they know this is a bad deal. It increases Aimia's margins and as long as the activity is limited it is survivable.Aeroplan will have better value to customers in 2 years. I've compared options where I could get a direct flight that's less than 2 hours with RBC points, or a 14-hour journey with Aeroplan. This is not unusual. Aimia's commitment is that they will allow both options, and not just for a restricted number of seats. Customers will recognize how important this is. It's reasonable to question how much of a discount Aimia will get and this is important. If it's only 5% that will threaten Aimia's profits. However airlines will openly offer larger discounts to corporations buying flights for their employees. Aimia spends a lot more than that.I believe that a lot of Aeroplan redemptions are for international travel. That opens up a lot of options beyond Westjet. There are a lot of flights out of Canada on airlines like British Airways, KLM, and Delta that Air Canada can't offer. Take a look at the departure schedules for the major airports. That means more possibilities for better flights, and more potential partners willing to offer even bigger discounts (though there is a risk of Aeroplan being known for pushing the airlines no one wants which would be to their detriment).As for Air Canada, they don't necessarily need to sign up a wide network of partners. Look at Delta, United, etc. They offer bigger rewards to their core customer who actually fly a lot. They also have a single credit card partner as an add-on but their programs would work without this.When the best Air Canada customers choose not to use Aeroplan, it is in Air Canada's interests to let them transfer their points over. I can't see this happening without some financial benefit to Aimia. As Aimia has stated in the past, the vast majority of Aeroplan members are infrequent travellers. I expect that the number of customers switching outright will be relatively small and the majority of Aeroplan points earned will not be impacted since Air Canada flights represent less than 20% of the points earned.Aeroplan may have been built up on the back of high-value rewards created through a special relationship with Air Canada. Those have been increasingly hard to find over the last 10 years. Even for a prime business class flight to Asia last year it took me months of hunting just to find a redemption that was worth barely 1.5 cents per point.But Aeroplan has a lot of customers already and it's ready to step up the value. Members have continued using the points despite the increasingly bad options and value. If that gets opened up to let members book the flights they want and as many seats as they want it will be a big step forward. The current management clearly sees this and Air Canada has not offered enough.In the end this could give everyone a better deal on what they want. The end result could be like Uber -- it didn't just replace taxis, it got a lot of people to take a ride when they never would have used a taxi. Air Canada will offer better value to the heavy users who actually prefer them, and Aeroplan will offer better value to everyone else. Given the recent announcements, it is the status quo before last year that now looks unsustainable.",
"From the article, ""Assuming one quarter of members shift to Air Canada's potential new plan in 2019 and the rest some time in 2020 or 2021, it would create a baseline $0 FCF alongside additional $1 billion of liabilities redemptions (half of total point liabilities) over 3-4 years.""Huh?  Under terms of the current contract, Air Canada cannot start up their program until July 2020.  That means zero shift in 2019 and zero shift in the first half of 2020.  And Aeroplan members would have the option of choosing Wesjet or other flights in 2020.  So, points redemption flexibility will increase, which is a good thing.",
"'AIMIA will have big difficulties as $1 billion of point liability redemptions would cause Aeroplan insolvency.' That statement by the author is of course nonsense. Nothing like that will ever happen. It's a Chicken Licken type scenario forecast. 'the sky is falling, the sky is falling'.Aimia has a great future with the current team.",
"It's interesting to see the different interests at play here:www.bnnbloomberg.ca/...->Phillips, Hager & North has become the biggest holder of Aimia’s preferred shares, with 4.5 million of them, or about 35 per cent of the $322.5 million outstanding.  Mamdani said. “For the board of directors of a high profile Canadian enterprise like Aimia with an obligation to 5 million Canadian customers to bow to the pressures of one very optimistic shareholder is unlikely and would in my opinion be the height of poor judgment.”Of course the largest owner of the prefs wants the deal.  He doesn't need anymore money to cover the pref redemption!  This is why I hate journalists.  They always find someone to pain 1/4 of the story.  Why not get a perspective from someone who owns the common too?",
"There is a flaw in this bit of the analysis:""What we mean by that is if about half of members stay with AIMIA and the other half eventually move to Air Canada's new plan, both companies will take an extraordinary hit.AIMIA will have big difficulties as $1 billion of point liability redemptions would cause Aeroplan insolvency.""If the outstanding liability today is $2bn, and half of members leave Aeroplan for Air Canada's new program, that does not mean that the miles these members have accumulated will just disappear. They would still be redeemable, and very probably defecting members would try to use all their miles and clean out the accounts.If anything, this would accelerate redemptions by these members.",
I'm no longer a shareholder..but AC did say the NPV for their inhouse loyalty program is $2 - 2.5bn over 15 years.  It's hilarious that they think Aimia would accept this deal after AC's disclosure/forecast.,
"*The cost of signing up a client for an established loyalty program such as Aeroplan starts at around $200 a pop (the range usually is $200 to $400).Aeroplan has ~5mln users. $200 x 5mln = $1bln already.That is for an established and well-known loyalty program. Aeroplan users have been accumulating and exchanging points on an average of 10 yrs.*If a person were to sign up for AC's program, they would either have to start from scratch (which is not really pleasant for him/her since she is likely accumulating points for years), or AC has to dole out various bonuses for signing up which increases the cost of signing up people. Alone, for this reason, I think the $200/person is a bit low.*Another point has to do with people's habits. Usually, they don't like to change them too much. And Aeroplan is entrenched in peoples lives for years, even decades.*AC is in a business with high fix costs and a homogenous product. That means price competition is high and efficiency/low cost is king. To achieve a low cost per seat sold, AC needs high volume in seats sold. They cannot afford to leave a seat empty. Therefore the $700mln of Aeroplan purchasing power, compared to AC's $16bln in revenue for 2017 does matter quite a bit.Taking all this into consideration, the $250mln ($50/person) offered by AC was a joke, as far as I can see at the moment.I think that AC is in deep shit.EDIT: The comment by AC during its conference call is simply pressuring. During negotiations, one tries to give the perception of a very strong hand. The quote regarding AC starting its own program again, should AIMIA not accept the offer, sounds more like huffing and puffing to me. Besides, at one moment AC supports an internal program, the next moment they want to kill their own efforts and buy Aeroplan. Who in his right mind would want to be part of AC's internal efforts with such a fickle management?? I would not touch taht thing with a 10ft pole.",Aimia Vs. Air Canada: Who Has The Upper Hand?
"I think time, not quantity, is really more the issue.  On the 787 program, the extension to 1500 airplanes means that Boeing will be recognizing costs incurred over more than a 15 year period of time.  So, does it really make sense that costs incurred in 2008 are still being written down when Boeing delivers the 1500th airplane in maybe 2023?  No other established programs are close to that, usually accounting block extensions cover a 3 year time frame, or at most, a 5 year period.",
"Although I agree that block extensions increase profitability for the 1,500 airplanes, it remains a fact that the underlying motivation by Boeing to continue to increase block sizing is to avoid a write-down on the program. This is not Boeing bashing, just a simple truth that Boeing has had to increase the initial accounting block of 500 airplanes of ""low single digit margins"" to 1,500 airplanes of ""low single digit margins"".  I still think investors might be better off if Boeing jettisoned the boat anchor of early program losses, took the write-down, and then enjoyed recognizing margins of >10% on newly produced units.  The market has a short memory, and the boosted financials would soon really energize the stock price.",
"This is why I can't understand why Boeing would want to embark on an expensive programme to build a 265 (and 225) seat NMA, which will erode B787-8 sales.

"The two most hyped IPO's of late were TENB and OPRA. Both surged as one might expect on the open but then drifted down. There is no question of the quality of TENB from people I know in the cyber security field. still, like the author, I don't like chasing IPO's. There are a couple of things on IPO's in particular and a couple on OPRA specifically.First, never buy an IPO on opening day. IF you can get in on the IPO wonderful, but keep in mind that the underwriters (in most cases) have a commitment to support the prices in the initial two weeks to a month. Second, try selling the shares you got in the IPO during that period. If you do, you will NEVER get into another IPO from that dealer and note that your broker won't get paid his share and probably get severely reamed out! So there is the first problem, as selling will undoubtedly occur after that time frame. Add to that no further need for the underwriters to support the issue so it had better be good and live up to expectations.Second, what is the lockup period for insiders? Know this and realize it is likely a lot of shares will be sold after that period. In the case of TENB, three officers own 27mm shares each...and then there is the exemption from disclosure by the SEC of a contract expiring in 2023! Wouldn't you like to know what that is?In the case of OPRA, after the predictable surge on the opening, within one hour it traded down to within 29 cents of the offering price. This is the author's reasoning on why he might buy it. I can't argue with that but I can also say that it could just as easily bust and likely would have without support from the underwriters. Now consider volume on all these recent IPO's; after a week or so it plunges, call it high freak traders, whatever it isn't a good sign.The other negative not brought up in the article is that besides Twitter, its other main contract is with Google. I believe that contract is up on 2020 - check me on that.So how much risk is there to watching an waiting? In my opinion, little...but you make your own decision on this.

"In all of the above that FM chip is included just because they still include it.... A lot to read, thank you. . Ownership doesn't mean anything to me here. Am much more interested in the overall picture  than just one part of it. CarPlay has a chance to become more included in people's routines as connectivity technology allows the phone to be free, for many tasks, without consumers even thinking about it. So far the actual number of users is exactly the same as Google and is stuck. Going 'All In' with Google is a great experience, surrender to the technology and let it help drive your life. Maps and location are most crucial, Apple pulled Maps entirely to rebuild it, which is smart. I'm interested in what they might launch along with the newer Maps. It's fair to say they are looking at the world of tomorrow that will have less ownership and more sharing. That's good for subscription models. Advertising supports too much IMO, the value of appropriate targeting and understanding data. If Apple changes the game, in a car, it would be along the lines of an Amazon like utility for life, with their spin on content, design, and involve a subscription that copies Google 'All In' which beats the experience of iOS for a majority of the population, the spenders are on iOS though, until Google takes Android in house, a debate itself, as they support countless third parties allowing that revenue to leave their family of firms.Content is the same until the artists take more control of their own Branding and distribution, themselves. A trend that is not stopping. I recall the day in the late 90's when a buddy showed me the new stereo system in his beloved BMW. He built his own dash technology with a used hard drive and spare parts. It even worked with Napster, at the time. He built his own dash for about 200$ way back then, made it work with every possible technology at the time. That's still why 'Anything is possible' as youth will drive the business, and the community will police the youth, hands off but observing, and investing.  www.recode.net/...",
"No sure if I'm in an argument with someone on CarPlay and, if so, whose side am I on. Stick to my legal training, and use footnotes.Many people used to bring up CarPlay as the ""Sirius-killer."" I would be all over these people using basically the same argument that Sirius and CarPlay differed so much in content that would scarcely be competitors.About six months ago it occurred to me that, although CarPlay had been out there three or four years, you never read much about it and it certainly didn't appear to have hurt SiriusXM.So I did a little Googling and found that I was pretty much wrong about CarPlay. Those that had used it generally liked it very much.

Initially, major automakers were apprehensive about offering CarPlay or Android Auto on their vehicles but over the years, they have gone ahead to support both of them in their infotainment system.""www.iphonehacks.com/..._______________________________________________________""Car buyers are showing an increased preference for vehicles that have in-car human machine interfaces (HMI), with solutions offered by tech companies being more popular than the on-board systems installed at the factory, according to a study from researcher Strategy Analytics. Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Baidu CarLife are a ""must-have"" for prospective car buyers, the study found.""www.mobilemarketer.com/...______________________________________________________The principal reason that we have not hear more about CarPlay is the the automakers have been slow to support it.   A long article on the reasons that CarPlay and Android have taken so long to move into autos in force.Four reasons Apple's Carplay and Google's Android Auto Still aren't Ubiquitousventurebeat.com/...___________________________________________________________________Here is a tedious list of all 100 auto models supporting CarPlay as of 1 August 2018. A highlight is Toyota, which this model year is for the first time making Carplay available in some Toyota and Lexus models. They had previously complained that they were too distracting to install in the car. (I've seen a Lexus Ad pumping CarPlay as available.)www.autotrader.com/...""Apple CarPlay is one of the best Apple products to come along since the first iPhone was introduced a little over a decade ago. Essentially, it brings the iPhone's functionality into your vehicle, mirroring many of the iPhone's most frequently used features."" _______________________________________________________________Here is the current relationship between CarPlay and the auto dash. It's not elegant. See the negative at the end of this text. (""the entire in-dash screen is subsumed by the Apple interface. That means the display won't show you the radio station you may have tuned in or the car's other options."")""Does CarPlay take control of the dashboard?No — and yes.""""You will not be able to use the CarPlay app to select radio stations, turn on cruise control or adjust the A/C in the car, for example. So you can't ask Siri to make the driver's temperature 72 degrees. Those voice commands will still be managed, where available, by the car's own speech-recognition system.""""Nevertheless, like other apps, CarPlay works in concert with the car's other systems to reduce distractions and hopefully improve safety. For example, it will automatically mute for audible warnings like a cross-traffic bell or blind-spot alert chime.""""On the other hand, in some vehicles, when you engage CarPlay, the entire in-dash screen is subsumed by the Apple interface. That means the display won't show you the radio station you may have tuned in or the car's other options. Getting out of CarPlay to these other features can also be a bit confusing. In Hyundai vehicles, for example, a Hyundai icon appears next to Apple apps; tapping it takes you back to the car's main screen.""_____________________________________________________________A final long reference to CarPlay in general, should you need it.www.digitaltrends.com/...",

I would assume that smaller companies like Volvo, Mazda and Jaguar are also on board.

"Jonathan,Thank you for introducing this interesting company. I like the MoA, but am concerned about the product on the market that has the same molecule as DCCR. Soleno downplayed Proglycem suspension/capsule as two or three times a day and has a bitter taste, and claimed that Proglycem is not allowed to be used for PWS. But we all know, physicians treat patients with off-label all the time, especially if it is dirt cheap.If I were a PWS patient who know that Proglycem works for me, I may not care much taking it two or three times a day (small nuance, really). As for the taste (BTW, the suspension on the market has a chocolate-mint flavor), I am not sure if that is a big deal, either.Below is a brief description about Proglycem:Proglycem® (diazoxide) is a nondiuretic benzothiadiazine derivative taken orally for the management of symptomatic hypoglycemia. Proglycem®Capsules contain 50 mg diazoxide, USP. The Suspension contains 50 mg of diazoxide, USP in each milliliter and has a chocolate-mint flavor; alcohol content is approximately 7.25%.",

"This article provides a good overview of the lithium battery/EV market as a whole, but I do question many of the points made about HPJ.First of all, anyone observing the stock over the past few years would be able to tell you that the stock price does not move in correlation with HPJ's revenue growth. HPJ also cannot be compared to similar battery producers since the market simply does not assign a comparative earnings multiple to HPJ (whether this is fair or not does not matter - the market has persistently assigned HPJ an egregiously low multiple).Also, as Henrik pointed out above, while HPJ is a major player in the rechargeable battery space, they do not focus exclusively on electric vehicles and as such their business won't reap all of the growth from EV since they operate in other areas.Overall, I'm always glad to see an update about HPJ on Seeking Alpha as it is a lightly covered and underappreciated stock, but I do wonder how closely the author has followed HPJ over the past few years.",

That might be due to the fact that the company needs to invest heavily to keep track with competition.Another area for improvement is Investment Relations.

Efficient markets huh ?AMD the company now worth 30% of the value of MU whilst still generating negative free cash flow. And meanwhile MU,

"I see so much confusion on the announced buyback.  As the author writes...""Micron announced that it is prepared to return 50% of its free cash flow to stockholders and the company is set to buy back up to $10 billion of its stock. ""I personally interpreted the announcement as MU will be returning up to 50% of free cash flow by buying back up to $10 billion in stock.  Not buyback and return cash flow.  So many people expecting a $10 billion buyback as soon as Sept hits.  I was under the impression MU will start buying back in Sept using up to 50% of free cash flow which could carry on for several years.  Please correct me if I'm mistaken.",

Remember. 90% of the stuff you worry about never happens.  This holds true for DRAM pricing.,
"Only the paranoid survive, Intel needs to do the same.",
The risk with Micron is China.  They make such essential components and they are so profitable that they become a target for potential competition in the future and from government manipulation which is so typical in China.China is also one of their biggest markets.They need to diversify in higher end chips and devices and use the good times to solidify their finances and R&D.I am not sure buying up that many shares is in the best interest of shareholders.  Everything has to be done in a measured approach.,
Don’t understand why this stock is not moving up in the last few months inspite of so many bullish articles and ratings. There is something holding it which someone knows about MU. Why no company shows any interest in buying this company. Why W Buffet don’t see an opportunity. Time will give answers to my question perhaps.,
"The market is still expecting a price collapse. Once the collapse risk is removed, Micron is a 12-15% 10-year CAGR (peak-to-peak) proposition. This makes the PEG ratio less than 0.4     Earnings will drop once the datacenter supercycle slows down but I think we saw with LCRX what happens when management use words like “bottom.”The market doesn’t like being at the peak but it will love “seeing the bottom.”",
One thing holding back MU stock from increasing is that Sammy reported a drop in DRAM pricing last quarter.  The market place is still skeptical that MU can bucket this trend,

"Hi, everyone. Besides the negative sentiment on Ingenico and the recent news about short sellers (ca. 10% of free float), has anyone heard or seen anything? At current valuation there seems to be a huge price/value asymmetry. Ingenico would either have to grow sales only 1-2% pa. over the next 10 years or operating margins would have to collapse from ca. 15% to ca. 8%. Of course there are infinite combinations between these two scenarios. Either way, I don’t think any of them is realistic and, thus, the market is overreacting big time. In my assumptions (which I think are reasonable), I think Ingenico’s fair value is somewhere around EUR90-100. I assume: sales CAGR of 5-6% in the next 10 years, operating margins fairly flat at around 15%, EPS, CAGR of 6-7%, terminal growth of 2.5%, WACC around 6.5%.Any different views?",

"A single socket AMD 7nm Eypc 2 with 64C/128T server setup will need much cheaper and offer better performance than a dual socket Intel 28C/56T Xeon. 28 C is already push the limit for Intel's monolithic architecture design in term heat issues, power consumption and manufacturing efficiency. Intel needs to redesign the CPU completely or they'll loose market shares to AMD much faster when the Epyc 2 are out. And Intel need to start now or it'll be too late. What happened to Nokia, Blackberry, Kodak, all those once a too big to fail giant in their sector can all fade away when they stopped the to innovate.

"thanks for an impartial summary.  confirms my gut feeling that there’s a lot more to this than the over simplified and obsessive fixation on the  nanometer marketing label companies put on their chips.Sometimes i think Intel would probably spike upward if they just called their 10nm efforts 7 nm.i’m kidding, well a little bit - about 3nm :-)",
"Density of 7nm processes from TSMC (sampling already), Globalfoundries and Samsung (still in the making as far as i know) are very similar to Intel's 10nm process in most important process metrics. It seems that Intel can achieve slightly denser logic but the 7nm foundries have much denser SRAM cells. Taking into account that high performance CPUs these days have a lot of memory (SRAM) integrated, this is a crucial metric. I would say, most likely it is a wash, but we'll only know for sure once some designs have been analyzed in detail (there are 10nm chips available from Intel, but no 7nm ones from the foundries yet).There are other things, that are completely unknown yet, things like power and performance but also yield/cost. This may be more important. Intel will most likely not be able to compete in costs, since they have much lower volume than the fabs which increases costs per wafer/chip made (taking depreciation of equipment and R&D into account). Performance wise, Intel was ahead of the foundries in the past but it is a bit hard to compare, because the design is also crucial here. AMD still can't achieve the high clock rates Intel can, which helps Intel with single core/thread turbo performance. Power consumption is already pretty good with AMD's processors made on foundry 14nm processes. Those details may be critical for Intel If Intel can't sustain a performance and/or power lead, it will be very hard for them to compete at costs. This is the critical part which is not fully known yet.",
"there’s a lot of talk about 10 nm and who gets there first, last. But we rarely talk about what those 10 nm or 7nm terms really mean.  Here is a paragraph from Wiki“The naming of process nodes by different major manufacturers (TSMC, Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries) is partially marketing driven and not directly related to any measurable distance on a chip – for example TSMC's 7 nm node is similar in some key dimensions to Intel's 10 nm node. Nevertheless, as of 2017, the technological race to the greatest density was still competitive between the main players, with TSMC, Samsung, and Intel all holding leading positions between the years 2016 and 2017 when measured by the smallest feature size on chip.[14]” when I look at the specs for Intel’s 10 nm chip it looks a lot better (to this amature tecky)than the other companies.  it’s her like comparing car performance only on cubic inches of the engine. There’s a little bit more to it than just the label 10 mm.   I would appreciate someone with a deeper understanding of these things to comment and perhaps speculate on whether some companies are postponing purchases because the Intel 10 nm Chip will havegreater performance than the existing 10 nmor chips from Intels competitors",
"Good article.  I like articles that give details on the positives and negatives.  Intel is not IBM.  They are successfully getting significant growth outside their legacy products and surprisingly getting growth even there.  This is a company geared for 3-5 years out.  Capex and R&D are massive and they are in many of the cutting edge markets.  Concerns about high capex are not too relevant for a company with a rock solid balance sheet and huge cash flow. They can afford it and have alot left for more acquisitions.Where else do you get value and growth in the same stock?  There now, I think I just talked myself into this one.",

The stock buyback is actually a sign that it can't find suitable partners at an attractive price.  I own a competitor, UBSI, which is a smaller bank.   UBSI pays a nice dividend and has a 25 + year of dividend increases.  I took what for me is an outsized position in UBSI, and frankly, I haven't made a lot of money.

Still, I have a number of small cap banks, plus I own AFL, an insurance company, so I have to decide what percent of my portfolio should be financial related.  The nice thing about the smaller banks is that they are more acquisitive and an acquisition moves the needle in terms of income, i.e., they are more accretive.  Granted, they are more thinly traded.  I bought PFBI in March, and I am up 40% since then, plus my entry price was before a 25% dividend increase, so I am yielding over 4.0% dividend.  Some of that is just good luck in the timing though.  The smaller banks, i.e. 2b in assets don't apparently want to exceed $10b in assets as there is more regulation.  But there are more economies of scale between their present asset point and the $10b.

"I never fully understand hedging, if CHK hedge NG at $3 plus why not cash in some of the hedge since they have less NG production to protect?",
"The writer of this article and many posters missed the biggest element of this transaction.  The sale results in $2 billion of cash and the removal of future capex on the acreage of $2.5 billion.  In addition interest charges decrease by $100 million a year.  Over the next 5 years those numbers total to a $5 billion dollar swing in cash flow for CHK with no taxes on CHK.In addition the Saudi oil minister points out that oil production decreases by 5% per year on existing wells and needs replacement.  Saudi Arabia upped production in the last six months to hold the price from going up and hurting the world economy and is producing within 1/2 a million barrels a day of its maximum production and transportation infrastructure capabilities.  The U.S. is installing sanctions on Iran and anyone trading with Iran.  This  is going to remove Iran's production from the world market this Fall.  Venezuela, one of the larger producers has falling production due to failing to expend dollars on capex each year to keep production up so it falls 5% per year.Many are expecting oil prices in 2019 to be the highest in five years.  It's a perfect storm that is brewing.CHK is going to spend most of its capex in the next two years on oil drilling and has said they expect 30,000 more barrels a day in oil production and this will be coming in without hedges in 2019 and 2020.  Double your oil barrels without hedges at $55 a barrel and sell oil at $75-100 during the perfect storm and what does that get you? Also, no writers or pundits in recent Seeking Alpha articles have pointed out what is going to happen with natural gas exports from the U.S. growing by 100% per year over the next 5 years from export plants commencing their shipments or expanding export processing capacity.I was hoping to sell CHK within the next 5 years into a perfect storm for $25 a share.  My fear is that once debt reaches $7 billion, Exxon or Chevron issues shares of stock equal to 3-4-5% of their equity and takes out CHK for stock, not impacting their (Exxon or Chevron) balance sheet debt or liquidity.  Then I only receive $10-15 per share in Exxon or Chevron shares.  My ideal scenario is that CHK stays independent for the next 5 years.No article has mentioned what technology has done for CHK and other energy producers.  They expect CHK to remain frozen in time like the last quarterly or annual report.  Does every one really think that CHK is not going to improve drilling and recovery each year going forward, that technology is going to stop making improvements in the industry.  I think CHK makes improvements and gets more oil and more gas out of each reservoir with technological improvements.  CHK use to drill wells that took one month for each rig on each well.  During the last decade that dropped and dropped each couple of years and now takes half the time.  CHK was a financial mess when the current CEO took over.  He has cleaned up 90% of the mess.  CHK actually still owns a piece of a drilling/servicing company and could sell that company in 2019 in the strongest oil market in the last 4-5 years.  Proceeds could reach 1/2 a billion dollars or more and they could pay debt down to $6.5 billion by middle of 2019.  Add that to all new oil production selling at $75 or $80 or more in a 6 month oil spike and CHK can be down to $6 billion in total long term debt by end of 2019.  Does anyone other than shorts really think that CHK is going to sit still and their balance sheet stops improving.  This CEO has improved the amount of future commitments, the ever growing debt and while CHK's CFO  had to write down the balance sheet as oil and gas prices collapsed over the previous few years, he does not get to write them UP as energy prices rise.  The balance sheet is understated.  The value of the company is understated and attempting to value it based on the distressed sales of acreage and old wells is understating what wells and land bring in during their first 2-3 years of production at higher prices.  CHK had to sell land and wells where they received $2-3 per MCF or $30-40-50 oil per barrel.  The next cycle is coming and CHK will see $4-5 gas in the next five years and $65-95 oil.  Nothing stays low unless we over produce it.  Remember, the world sells 90 million new cars and trucks each 12 months and 99% of 2018 sales of cars and trucks do not run on lithium batteries.  The world population expands by 75 million people every 12 months. They consume energy.  The airline fleets and military planes around the world and cargo ships do not run on lithium batteries either and will not during any of our lifetimes.  They gobble jet fuel and diesel fuel. The CEO was dealt a mess, he has cleaned it up.  Brighter days are around the corner (2019).",

I’m also pleased that this is done at a fair market price, as compare to the $600 million they were offered two years ago. It takes a while to eliminate the negative sentiment in any stock. Those who bought the last rally off the bottom to $10 will need to sell out before this can truly run, just as those who bought the previous rally over $5 or this rally over $5 will need to sell out and let their negativity end.

"Hi George,while I believe hydrogen cells will be the main fuel for propulsion and other uses I would prefer it come from renewable sources. Microbial biomass conversion is very intriguing and can be produced from cow feces or algae among which are only a few of the sources. WHILE THESE MAY NOT BE THE MOST EFFICIENT SOURCES THEY ARE VERY ABUNDANT. I have worked in Nuclear power plants along the east coast during shut downs, refueling and emergency repairs. I am as against Nuclear as much as illegal immigration. While I may not be the sharpest crayon in the box my understanding of nuclear is like playing Russian roulette. that however can be a conversation for another day. For fuel cells to be the most earth friendly I feel hydrogen should be extracted as a byproduct of sources that are abundant and have the least negative effect on our planet. there are plenty of sources that  do not produce green house gases and by using that source can solve another problem. Such as extraction from landfills, algae, grass clippings, feces etc. By doing so it will virtually eliminate air pollution, green house gas issues and our dependency on oil. I strongly believe that electric propulsion is a joke and will go the same way as vhs  tapes and cd's. Electric vehicles will run it's course and then will be as forgotten as the horse and buggy. Ev's do not really solve our problems with the earth, it's atmosphere or with dependency for fossil fuels because it is those very things that are used to produce the electricity needed to charge batteries and it is those very same batteries that use vital metals and minerals that need to be extracted from the earth. What is the sense in that. Hydrogen cells are earth friendly and gas stations can easily be converted in to fuel cell exchange stations. Does anyone really want to drive 100 miles and then search for a charging station and then sit there for 70 minutes until your battery is charged. Not in this country. Fuel cell exchanges can be done in about the same time it takes to fuel up your car with gas. EV's are a false hope for people who want to be morally correct in saving our planet as is nuclear fusion. Nuclear waste is detrimental to the planet and the human race and without government subsidy's it would be totally cost INEFFECTIVE. Lastly, I believe the only thing holding us back from the fuel cell generation are the very very  rich and powerful oil companies. If fuel cell production was main stream the oil companies would be forced out of business.",
"FreakguyIt is an important ingredient to have diverse ideas and opinions on sites like this but what I find appalling is that when someone brings a difference of opinion that some of us need to counter with offensive language and name calling. It is really unappealing and says volumes about the offender. Anyway I am not ignorant of the position EV's hold in choices of vehicles available to the general public. Ev's still represent a very small volume of sales and are still only popular to a limited amount of buyers. The facts are still glaring that ev's have a limited range and while they are improving, without infrastructure in place such as ample public recharging stations the ev will not be serious competition to the traditional ic's. The US government has been responsible for artificially inflating the sales of ev's through fleet purchases and purchase reimbursement programs. I'm not bashing EV's I am just stating the obvious and that is that they will not eclipse the ic's for a very long time. Even if they do become more competitive electricity is not a reoccurring natural resource. Conversely, it needs to be  manufactured with resources and unfortunately the majority of that is fossil fuels. It is my opinion and the opinion of most that we are blindly lead to believe that ev's are good for the earth and save natural resources. We use several different metals that are short in supply just to make batteries for these cars. Are we not mining these metals? isn't mining also dangerous to our planet? won't we still need oil based products to produce tires and plastics to build these vehicles? I think we all know the answer. Now if your argument was in favor of fuel cell inspired vehicles I would agree with you whole heartedly. We don't hear much about fuel cells mostly because of greedy oil companies. Fuel cells should be the future because they provide zero  emissions and are manufactured with a reoccurring resource but sadly that design has largely been scraped so big oil can continue to profit. One more point. India 's electric grid is still basically prehistoric and while China has the ability and need to make these vehicles viable they to lack the infrastructure required for general use. Also the only other resource that Saudi Arabia can sell is sand and there is not a profitable market for that so they are not going to stop pushing fossil fuels until the faucet runs dry. I am 62 years old and have seen the rise and fall and rise again of all commodities not just oil. I am still part of the group that believes fossil fuels will continue to be King for at least a quarter of century before there is serious competition from any other source Oh and lets all try to lay off the insults even if we disagree. Thanks",
"""Unexpected Positive News In Chesapeake Energy""Sure hasn't helped the stock !",
While electric vehicles are increasing in popularity the infrastructure lacks investment. These vehicles as we know them are useless for long distance travel thus targeting a very small percentage of car buyers. Regardless of there popularity there is a greater need for electric power to operate these vehicles and anyone that does not live under a rock has to realize that we are moving away from nuclear power and replacing it with natural gas plants to produce our insatiable need for electricity. The argument that electric cars will reduce our need for fossil fuels is ridiculous and negligible at best.,

"Natural Gas has basically been held down by the over supply in the U.S.  Over the next five years the U.S. will ship 1% more each year of its production to overseas markets.  The lid on U.S. prices of $2.50-3.00 per MCF is going to change as new export facilities open up around the country.More importantly CHK said they would double production in oil in the PRB by the end of next year.  That 30,000 additional barrels of oil is production that will be production that could not have happened if CHK continued to pour cash into acreage just unloaded.Oil production is more valuable until all the U.S. natural gas export facilities open for business during the next five years and 5% of our production goes overseas, which should push prices of natural gas to $4-5 per MCF over the next five years.  As Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid A. Al-Falih recently told CNBC:    ""I believe if the investment flows that we have seen the last two or three years continue in the next two or three years, we will have a shortage of oil supply by 2020...between increase in demand and natural decline, we need millions of barrels every year to be brought to the market, which requires massive investment.""A major reason for this concern (that we might soon see much higher oil prices) is because global oil production declines by about 5% annually as wells become depleted, according to analyst firm McKinsey. In order to just maintain global oil supply at today’s levels, oil companies need to increase production by about 5 million bpd each year. Fans of CHK should understand that new production is not keeping up with supply as oil production decline in wells continues by 5% per year.  Many expect CHK to be hurt when oil prices decline.  We add 75 million people to the earth's population every year.  People consume energy and the more you have the more energy that is needed.  Wind and solar does not power most of the 90 million new vehicles: buses, trucks and cars sold each year.  Add that to the 75 million additonal people that turn 18 each year and that start driving cars for the next 50 years during their lifetimes.  That is a lot of oil needed for transportation.Planes do not operate on wind, solar or batteries.  Those fleets are growing with the world's population.CHK should be selling natural gas for $4-5 dollars, up from $2.50-3.00, oil that has been priced at $60-70 will probably be selling for $70-80-90 per barrel.  We just do not know when this becomes the new norm but wells are declining by 5% per year every year.  Drilling and infrastructure spending in the industry has not kept up.  Prices are not going down in the next 5 years.  CHK will have $3-5 billion less debt on the balance sheet in 5 years and will be one of least encumbered companies in the industry.I look at the equity prices of the companies with millions of acres in their portfolio and positive cash flow without under water hedges and these companies sell for 10x what CHK sells for.  Will CHK be at $50 per share in ten years?  Probably, but I probably am unloading in five years at $25.I hold a large position and added 2,000 shares this week.  Will probably add another 2,000 during August.  It has been a lot of hurt during the last 5 years so I will enjoy the next five years.Remember, oil sales by Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria and Iran will be less and less each year because of the declining investment in their well maintenance and infrastructure.",

The asset sale is a big win for the company. 17% loss of Q1 Revenue can quickly be made up through their other plays and they free themselves entirely of the Utica. The Utica will have it's time and place but that is not anytime soon. This frees up cash flow to be directed towards Powder River and other plays where the ROI's are much healthier.,
"Great article KCI, the PRB production in Converse County is exciting and it’s a smart move to ramp that asset up in order to offset the Utica production they just sold. Bought at $5, hoping for it to sell off more Monday so I can add more.

"Funny how once a narrative sets in, people seemed shackled to it regardless of what happens. The thinking was that CHK was overleveraged and should sell assets. So they did! And they will deleverage! Then a new complaint immediately surfaces to sustain the bearish narrative: they didn't sell it for more than fair value! So all they did was deleverage! But that's what I thought you wanted them to do!!! Now reading closer you see that they deleveraged without even impairing their production (if you give them a year's grace period on that claim). Wonder what the new beef will be! I see several are now mad that they hedged at $54/barrel, seemingly lost on them was the fact that NEXT year, they get a ~$16/bbl boost to selling prices worth $500MM in profit.As Roseann Rosannadanna used to say ""It's always something!""",
"What to think about the manipulation of prices in this stock. The share increase by roughly 15% after the news of Utica asset sale, and then return to 4,4$?? Clearly difficult to me to understand.

"Hi Matt,Thanks for the Informative article.I believe there is an obvious reason why Cobalt prices are down and continue to fall.While Trumps tariff threats have taken a toll on mining stocks, there is something more fundamental at the core of Cobalts problems. The fact that all the EV makers goal is to lower Cobalt use in their batteries. It’s success has led to its demise.We didn’t know if Elon Musks comments regarding eliminating Cobalt from their battery chemistry was a clever way to lower Cobalt prices or if if they really did lower it to near zero. An autopsy of the model 3 battery did reveal that there is very little cobalt. So instead of a 4:4:4 ratio of Nickel, Cobalt, Manganese found in the Model S most auto makers are working on battery chemistry closer to 6:2:2 or even 8:1:1So basically going from 30% to 10%, but as bad as that is, Tesla lowered their Cobalt dependency to 2% in their model 3.If Tesla can do it, the rest of the world will catch up soon enough.Perhaps the price of Cobalt will come down to more reasonable levels due to this and the cycle will start over again because Cobalt will be used if the price is attractive enough. So the million $ question is what price will that be?$25?$20?Either way, it will be too low for Ardea to turn a profit at those prices so I don’t think the mine will even get started.There is only one good news for Ardea to come away with from all this.The amount of Nickel used in the batteries will increase. If Nickel prices skyrocket, then there might be a chance Ardea can make back their investment back.",

"Gridbird, Thank You for your answer. I understand what you have said but the facts do not comply with your answer.I present to you the quote from the first quarter 2018 BAC report.As of March 31, 2018, Bank of America, all of its U.S. banking subsidiaries and other regulated subsidiaries were “well-capitalized” andexceeded all capital requirements to which each was subject, including applicable capital buffers. Bank of America’s capital conservationbuffer was 6.77 percent, in excess of its required capital conservation buffer (including the G-SIB surcharge) of 3.75 percent, and theleverage buffer was 3.76 percent. As a result, Bank of America is not subject to payout ratio limitations on distributions or discretionarybonus payments under Basel 3 requirements. The aggregate amount of surplus capital of subsidiaries engaged in the insurance businesswas $100 million. For additional information on regulatory capital and capital ratios for the Corporation, refer to Capital Managementwithin the MD&A section in the March 31, 2018 Form 10-Q and December 31, 2017 Form 10-K.For additional information on the capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers, refer to Capital Management within the MD&Asection in the March 31, 2018 Form 10-Q, Schedule A “Advanced Approaches Regulatory Capital” in Bank of America’s March 31, 2018Regulatory Capital Reporting for Institutions Subject to the Advanced Capital Adequacy Framework ― FFIEC 101 and Schedule HC-R“Regulatory Capital” in Bank of America’s March 31, 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies – FR Y-9C.

"Larry, the simple reason is they cant. Banks must meet certain financial requirements and ratios. This determines their financial health as needed by regulators. They simply cant just use customer deposits as Tier 1 capital. There are other tier layers of capital needed but non cummulative preferred fits regulation criteria to meet their needed ratios. Defining Tier 1 CapitalTier 1 capital is the core capital a bank holds in its reserves and exists as the primary source of funds. It's the assets a bank holds in order to continue providing for the business needs of its customers. Since banks typically provide capital for customers, this can include a substantial amount of risk. The capital held helps to ensure there is enough money to fulfill needs.Tier 1 capital includes common stock, retained earnings, and preferred stock. The amount of capital that is held shows the strength of that bank as a measure of financial preparedness in case of emergencies. Customer deposits is simply not the banks capital, its the people who deposit it. This stuff is very interesting, complicated, and details are way over my head as far as nuts and bolts go. It could be a semester college class taught in and of itself.",
Please help me understand why BAC would borrow money at 5.875%. They can get all the depositors money at least 2% less for five years. Why pay non tax deductible interest on the preferred when you could get a deduction on actual interest payments. What reason stock buy backs other than for financial engineering. I look forward to being educated by you. I know the simple answers I just want to see some knew ones explaining why.,
"Was able to do a pairs trade, took profits on the B and bought even more shares of the K.  Slightly better yield and much less premium to call.  The profit more than covered the call premium of the K.  If it drops below call will buy more instead of the 26 week T bills which I was going to buy this week, not anymore.",
"I find it comical how people are thumbing their noses at a 5.875% yield which is non-callable for five years (slightly lower YTC) for one of the largest banks in the world.  Yes an increase in rates would drive price down.  So take the divs and re-invest at lower levels and higher yields if that happens.  I owned numerous bank pfds through the '08-'09 debacle.  Prices got crushed, but they didn't miss one coupon and most of them have been called away.  Stick with quality issuers and you'll be fine.  I agree that buying below par is ideal, but a slight premium for a new issue makes a negligible difference in current yield.  Pay to attention to call dates as well, many issues north of par are currently callable.  That's where you can get hurt.",

Sticking with the L. Very happy I did. Won't get called anytime soon and dumping cash all over me.,
BAC is okay but not the preferred.  It is non cumulative.  That means if they miss a payment they do not have to make it up later.  Not that the issue is risky but it would seem the bank thinks it may hit a bad spot and does not want to cover it in the long haul.  Turns me off.

Much better off with a preferred “floater” with a fixed low rate.  Goldman Sach’s has one with a fixed 4% minimum and a floating to points  over libor.  It pays qualified dividends and is trading @ a $2 discount yielding about 4.8%.  When rates go up so will your yield.  If it gets called early you realize about 15% on your investment.,
Nice chart on MIC....80 down to 45....did they have a stock split or just a big haircut....,
"Most  preferreds including this one, are perpetual.  That means the buyer is the loser and the issue is the winner.  When inflation returns and 30 year treasuries again yield 7%, this perferred will be selling at $15 with no maturity to get par back.  In which case it will never be called.  These are only subject to the 15% rate if you are a corporation.  This is the worst time to buy preferreds.  You are much better off qualified dividends—they grow with inflation.  Try some MIC which yields 9% and has good upside.",
Don't own any preferred stock -  have never seen  an article on SA about preferred stocks that made me feel comfortable investing in one - mostly technical terms & charts i have little understanding of,
I'm sticking with Fixed to Floating preferred stocks for the time being.Dave,
Take a look at the BAC-L.  It is a convertible issue with a holders conversion election if the stock price trades in excess of something like $50 for 20 of 30 days.  I look at this as a hedge against price decay from rising rates as the common should rise in that environment providing support to the price of this preferred.  Seems a slight advantage in a potentially rising rate environment vs. the preferreds that lack this kind of provision.,
The L series appears to be non-cumulative.  www.quantumonline.com/...  Think your chart needs to be changed.,
"Another low ball Preferred that will get killed with any period of inflation.The Riley Preferreds were a great deal, as they mature in a reasonable period of time.

Also the yield is much better than long term treasuries although of course not as ""safe"" but I have made a lot of profit trading BAC preferreds so I have a soft spot for them.",
"Why do the dividends not count as qualified dividends for a lower tax rate? Either way, I know people love these for income, but these types of preferreds have always seemed like a lose-lose to me. If rates go up, you're stuck with a lower yielding security. If rates drop, I guess you get a good return for a couple years, but then they are called away. The L-series are the only ones I have ever purchased as they are not callable (great for if rates drop) and convertible to common (giving you an exit if inflation ramps up and rates go higher).Thanks for the info!",Bank Of America: This 5.875% Preferred Stock Has Begun Trading On The NYSE

Loaded up on long-term OTM calls after Thursday debacle. I agree to some extent with the author. FB has habit of talking down the stock on conference calls and they succeeded mightily. But the stock was absurdly cheap. Now it's even absurdly cheaper. I'm sorry. They beat profit expectations and grew over 40% y/y and are selling below 25x forward earnings. Most undervalued large stock around. And rock solid. Anyone who thinks management is not doing a good job should have their heads examined. From zero to 500+ billion in market cap in what? 12 years? 13 years? No one has ever done that. Not remotely close.  An ironclad worldwide monopoly with 2.5 BILLION users. No competition in sight. I believe they will continue to extract ever more $ from each of their users. Still a long growth path and really. If they grow 35% over the next 4 quarters and decelerate down to 10% growth over the next six or seven years they will be worth well north of a trillion dollars.They have no real reason to care much about the short term fluctuations of the stock price. They don't need to raise capital -- lol -- everyone in the room at the conference call is absurdly rich and doesn't need to sell any stock immediately. So they can think long term. Which is what real investors should want and should cheer. Government intervention? I don't think so. Imagine if Britain say fined FB 30billion dollars and FB refused to pay. What could Britain do? Shut them down? Take away the dope from their entire population? Riots and protests in the street. No. FB has reached the point where only the US govt could possibly do them harm and I sincerely doubt that the will could be mustered. Not to mention the fact that every single member of Congress. Every single member of the administration down to mail room clerks uses FB and has signed their licensing agreement.,

Thanks Warwick for your research and analysis!  Your knowledge and understanding in FB helps me know how to invest.  Gives me some peace after lasts weeks disaster!  :),
"Warwick, thanks for this excellent article!!!",
I do not think that FB is sandbagging here. They have been underinvesting for years in data protection which added to regulatory actions like European GDPR becoming commonplace has been a wake up call. But that is only part of the story as the company is also ramping up spending on innovation and new products to support future revenue growth and that is the majority of the reduced operating marginsThe 50% operating margins are only sustainable if the company accepts lower future growth. Compare the company to the far more mature Alphabet (Google) which has around 35% operating margins because they spend so much on maintaining 20% + growth.Margins might eventually expand a bit but won’t ever be above 40% again because of the necessity to drive continuous high growth The Google comparison is valid as these two companies dominate online advertising In the long run this share price drop will be a blip and there is not one high growth company I know that hasn’t suffered 20% or more share price drops along the wayI own shares of Alphabet and Facebook,

If one thing will destroy this company it will be its lefty politics. They risk alienating at least half of USA population. I am a shareholder but deleted my account.,
Zuckerberg should not mix his leftist political beliefs with business. He is the right leader for the company but he should put his CEO hat on during earning calls/meetings. People have invested their hard earned money trusting this company. He still has that awkwardness during interviews and mass audience addresses which do not reflect confidence.,

I see total $350M in Q3 2108 Truvada (+150 in USA only) Truvada will lose in EU because of generic in some EU states, but it only made up $86M of Truvada sales in Q2 2018 Yescarta (+27M from $40M) in Q1 2018. Over $100M in Q3 2018 (+$60M increase) is possible for this early ramp-up. Add it all up, and we could see conservative increase in revenues of $400M to $6.065B in Q3 2018.GILD/KITE is a genuine growth stock now and for the rest of in 2018 - and Q4 2018 revs should see revenues from TAF drugs alone increasing to $600 (conservatively).

All these projects will raise the demand for steel and I'm not sure that China will like to be dependent on steel production from other countries. P.S. I'm long PKX and I'll add on my position if the price goes below 65$",

"Thanks for your article. May I ask for a clarification? In the 'Valuation' section, second table, you have a 'ttm CFFO' figure of $ 2'400m. Can you specify what this refers to? Does 'ttm' mean the next 12 months?Because looking at the latest 6K filing, I see that they generated CFFO of about $ 400m last quarter and $ 1'000 in the first 6 months of 2018. Cheers",
"In Bloomberg interview with NXPI CEO Clemmer (which I thought was more in depth than David Faber’s interview w/Clemmer), one of the key things Clemmer said was that demand for automotive chip technology will increase 3x within next 6-7 years!That is phenomenal growth. True that NXP mgmt needs to refocus, make their sales to ZTE again and give is a more detailed gameplan on Analyst Day Sept 11.But several analysts have stepped up with Buy recommendations and price targets in $115-120 range (Including Stacy Rasgon at Bernstein with $115, and Jefferies with $120 PTs).",
"@Brad Kenagy Thanks for the updated piece.Pre-deal, in October 2016, NXPI was valued at a discount to its peers. It's uncertain whether that discount was either warranted or sufficient (maybe it should have had an even bigger discount -- unlikely but unknown). Current valuation shows an even bigger discount than 2 years ago, and the question remains  -- is it justified?NXPI throws off the largest amount of free cash flow per share among analog semiconductor manufacturers ($0.52 slightly above that of ADI and SWKS).Based on the most recent earnings call, I believe NXPI's forward guidance for earnings growth is between 5 and 7% per year. That's lower than its peer analog semiconductor manufacturers (ranging from 8% for XLNX to 12% for ST, and probably the best justification for a discounted value.I believe the best upcoming opportunity for an increase in NXP's share price will be the Analyst Day on September 11t. If NXP can present a convincing plan at for improving earnings growth to be in line with its analog semiconductor peers, it may be able to change some minds. In the meantime, the $5 billion buyback should help to create a floor under the stock.",

A really compelling article. Thanks for the read.,
"Yahoo Finance puts NXP's 5 year expected PEG ratio at 0.5. That makes this stock quite inexpensive, at least statistically. Consensus / mean EPS is pegged at 6.8 on Reuters for NXP. That puts the likely PE for 2018 at 14, not expensive by this measure either. NXP is not debt-burdened either (Q2 results release). Net debt to EBITDA is 0.75, healthy ratio.Seems like a stock worth entering in with a long term buy and hold view. But have to read up a bit more about this sector and its key players. I don't know much about this sector but I was following the Q-comm / NXP drama, more in its political flavour. Nvidia has scary valuation, NXP seems cheap. Any counsel would be welcome.",
"I also don't really agree with this analysis to any great degree. The problems are fundamentals. The company joining with qcom added diversity to qcoms revenue stream. The problems with NXPI are now somewhat serious. Firstly the Automotive sector has become highly crowded. Sure its a big sector but NXPI has essentially become a pure play microcontroller company with 2 big divisions, industrial microcontrollers and automotive microcontrollers. To a lesser degree they make applications specific chips for entertainment. So now we are in a position where the P/E is 34 and growth in the Automotive division (about half the company) is 7%, down several points from last year. This is telling me that some of their lunch is getting eaten, and makes me concerned that it may still decline further. I just can't believe this company hopped on the Auto bandwagon to this degree and divested divisions to become far less diversified. I expect the company to continue to be a rough ride - I don't think it is necessarily undervalued as nothing from the CEO suggests there is a plan to bring revenues back through organic growth. And that concerns me because this CEO doesn't have a track record in organic growth which is something you are going to need in a post M&amp;A world. The bottom line with this company has been debt and private equity and as a result the board has been out to sell this company to retrieve investments made. It makes it very difficult to change strategy to a traditional growth strategy. Without a better organic strategy a PE of 34 is too rich for me.",
"NXPI management team was prepared to cash-out and go to the beach. Combined with the distraction of this long/exhausting sale process, I doubt NXPI is prepared for the near future.  Management took their eyes off the ball, and are not excited about continuing to work...but M&A is dead until the trade battles with China are resolved. I expect some missed earnings and reduction in revenue projections.",
I for one am happy the deal fell through. And if NXP is looking for an acquisition target I wonder if maybe SLAB is on their radar?,
"You got to look at margins as well as price to sales . Nxp margins are quite low compared to the rest , especially Nvda and Txn Txn is closer to nxp an yet it's margins are much higher ...Also memory chips and non memory chips usually do not merge so putting the, together as a potential merger is very very unlikely My opnion is Qualcomm or Broadcom are the only fit for nxp",
"China has their own agenda and it is laid out in their “2025 Initiative”. They plan on dominating the tech sector by 2025 and have said so publicly. They will not approve ANY Tech mergers or buyouts unless they somehow strengthen their 2025 Plan which means no foreign companies will be merging because that would make them stronger or more competitive to the Chinese Homegrown. They will continue to steal Intellectual Property (MICRON) and force Tech companies that sell or make products in China to partner and share their IP and Research and Development with Chinese counterparts. What the Chinese can’t steal, they will “strong arm” from existing foreign companies doing business in China. Tech M & A is dead from this point forward if it requires China approval. Folks should go read their 2025 Initiative and draw their own conclusions.Disclosure: NXPI Shareholder",
Thanks for the article. What are your feelings about QCOM post NXPI?,
"I’m not a trade expert but nobody thought the EU would deal and yet they are. This will force/scare China to deal and then they won’t play politics with deals like this .  The other good news is , 8 regulators clears the path for another suitor to go after NXP .",
"very nice comparative analysis. also should consider that post-deal failure NXPI is instantly worth $2B more, so all their value stats get way better, and any future buyouts are at least $2B more costly.",
"We can agree on something finally, and that is nxpi is undervalued. I've been long qcom for a year and a half but only long nxpi since Wednesday 10 minutes before close. Either I make a quick $30 a share or I hold an undervalued company for awhile. Only had a small position and wanted to double it yesterday at 90 but I was busy the time it was around 91 and got flustered, not buying higher. Enjoyed the article but including the m&a is quite a bit preemptive. Also, including the moving average after, like you've said, they've been linked to the qcom buyout, adds no value. Hope to get some updates from you along the way!",
how to tell when stock buyback kicks in,
Great article. Definitely agree with your analysis. Any particular options you would suggest.,
Company is udervalued. Should avoid merger trap till things with China are settled and just grow stock value,
"Things may very well have fundamentally changed for M&A in the tech space.  It's possible that China's ""non-decision"" non-approval might be an indication that if a tech merger would be disadvantageous to China's tech sector, it now ain't gettin' approved.  It will be interesting to see if tech M&A grinds to a halt here or not.  But, in any case, I think NXP is not going to have the stomach to go through another acquisition any time soon.  I do agree that NXP is at least a bit undervalued here.  I hope management is wasting no time in buying back stock here at these levels.",
"Don't think NXP will even think about accepting another offer, they lost a lot of time.",
"Thanks for the article on other possible suitors for NXP.  Question, does anyone know if NVDA or TXN would need Chinese approval .  I think we agree until the trade war with China is over nobody wants to get clipped like QCOM.",
"If only AVGO hadn’t made the offer on CA, then NXP would make a perfect candidate for absorption into their model of semi development and growth.",

reading this feels like its BIG sell,
"Management wholly incompetent. I've never seen a series of disastrous capital raises and reverse splits in a company with such ""good data"". Incredible that Maslowski allowed the company to become so leveraged, and destroy trust with long term holders and institutions who all sold in droves. The data and market may be real, but the management have demonstrated zero competence in being able to solidly execute. The other event missing from this article is the ""Review of Strategic Alternatives"" - which was timed weirdly just after the data read out. It killed any momentum from the stock, or investor view that the management even believed they could execute. IMO-  you will get burned by being long, unless they get bought - in which case, enjoy the ~+20% premium on the massive loss you might incur till then. As a possible remedy, the board should vote to remove and replace the management, or be acquired by a competent biotech.There are also no major catalysts until 2019, and the share price may drift down",
"Very well written. Market understandably or giving it any credit given the past dilution. Ultimately, biotech’s are driven by drugs with meaningful benefit in unmet need. FCX-007 appears to be doing that. While this is ultra rare, there may be room for multiple players. $FCSC could get 20-30% of market. Will somewhat depend on $KRYS safety profile (risk of anti bodies). If $FCSC continues to deliver on clinical data, the market will start looking “forward”",
"FCSC history includes trying to address wrinkles, then restrictive burn scarring, then vocal cord scarring and now, RDEB. Just the latest in a long line of shiny ideas they wave in front of investors faces. They even got orphan drug for status for one of these designations. There was also a 25-1 reverse split in the 2015/2014 time frame. So, yes, investors have been burned many times by FCSC, and the management has thankfully changed since David Pernock's time, but just because the sum total of reverse splits is 25 X 5 X 3 = 375:1, and they have a minuscule market cap doesn't mean that they are any closer to solving the RDEB problem.

Looks like folks at Sun Trust called the bottom. Market is wrong about BPL,
"Running with an investment premise that if BPL cuts their distribution the share price has to go down was always flawed logic IMO.Why?  Because it totally dismisses any input of value.That's pretty dumb.  The idea of whether the share price is 72 or 32 does not matter, all that matters is it has to go lower....regardless of it's current trading price. And at that point it will be a good buy.....which to me is just doubling down on dumb again since there is zero input of value.The reason management is looking at all options to change their business model is based on the simple premise they can't figure out why the market is valuing their profits/assets so poorly in the first place.  They just said ''we are not going to cut...period'' and then market moved lower.  They said ''we are going to return to a 1X distribution number by Q4 and then grow dramatically in the 2019-20 period'' and the market still moved them lower.So why is their share price soooo important to them?  It's because that is their main source of future funding capital  If they have to pay a 15% yield on every future share they sell that puts a serious limit on their growth prospects.  Over the last 8 years they've been able to get a spectacular 16% annual return on their ''opportunities/capital invested''.  Well, if you are paying 15% for that money those so called ''golden opportunities'' you see don't look so golden anymore.  They can't just run solely with debt...because they can't go above the 5X EBITA number without driving up those costs, too (their investments are always back loaded also....first they spend the money and then two years or so later increased earnings show up).So....they need to get their price higher.   If they do.....everyone wins.But my thinking is the fix is VERY simple....just give the market what it wants and it will respond.  BPL makes a ton of cash, has super stable and valuable assets and very reasonable debt right now at 4.3X EBITA. Their EBITDA will also probably bump up another 200M or so over next two years (new projects coming on line and backwardation going away).So they don't need to reinvent the wheel or create new value with accounting tricks.  They just need to remodel their growth funding mechanism (like the market wants to see).My guess is in the end, 90 days from now, the market is very happy.  Why?  Because the entire purpose of this review is to make the market happy (increased share price). You can bet right now they are looking at other companies to see how they are being valued.  My thinking is just pick one with the model the market gives the greatest value to (I'm thinking 4X EBITA and 1.2X distribution coverage...and never go below that).Do that and the yield goes to 5 or 6% going forward (and the share price goes back to where it was 18 months ago).....like MMP.",
"Read the whole article and all comments. Not a mention of K1, so do they issue that, or is it a simple distribution 1099 thing?",

Thank heavens BPL is run by well-educated operating professionals and not by MBAs and number jocks who would have to sniff through a lacy hanky before they'd mince their way from the car to the business end of a terminal or switching point.

"IMHO, the commentary here is about secondary matters.  Primary: Value derives from capability and reputation. As somebody who worked in the business, I can state that you could calibrate a Swiss watch with one of BPL's pipeline movements. Precision counts in this business: you don't waste interface. You can run your infrastructure at full bore when needed.  BPL is about the precision required to run a geographically distributed, heavily regulated business that conveys volatile substances.  Where you can be eviscerated if you don't keep your eye on the ball; on the timer; on the valves; on your relationships with your regulators, customers and competitors; and on potential waste.",

The critics try to apply their so-called conventional wisdom (and cookie-cutter analysis) to every MLP insisting in the end that every high-yielder must cut its distributions as its only viable option, as if they possess the same detailed knowledge of the company as its management, and assume that all management teams are the same... An MLPs corporate culture and the experience of its management team are major determinants in its ability to formulate a viable strategy and execute. The critics are just wrong here on BPL...",
"I think is a cut is coming, but I think it’s more than priced in.  They could cut to $3.4 annualized (>10% yield) and still have 1.3-1.4 coverage with 4.3x leverage.  Hard to imagine unit price dropping on that announcement imo.",
"Truthfully, an individuals yield never changes. If you paid $60 then your yield is 8.4% not 15%. If BPL payed folks 15% on your purchased price that would be sweet. I like to figure yield on my holdings by dividing total shares (DRIP) by total original purchase price. Then you have a yield that goes up. My neighbor bought 900 shares F in 2010 and reinvested every last penny. Now he has 1558.xxx shares. It worked out to $6.10/share. Regular F div. at that share price is about 9.6%. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work the other way.",
"The so-called ""smart money"" has been selling BPL all year, my man. The stock is down 45% for the year. And if the current management had any brains they would have cut the distribution months ago.

"FWIW Last year I updated my stock price prediction program based on the Value Line rating sheets for 1263 stocks/year for the years 1991-1992 through 2016-2017.  (The rating sheets run from approximately May - August.)   The model involved 44 predictor variables and had a multiple correlation with the actual stock's growth index (P1/P0 / M1/M0) where P1 and P0 are the stock's opening and closing price and M1 and M0 are the value line geometric index ratings.  On 12 June, I was surprised to find my program screen included BPL in the top 25 stocks selected for the next year's growth and I bought in at $37.44 and again at $35.50.  No other MLP has made the list.  As current quotations show, my program is so-far wrong.   (Perhaps, as traders like to say, I'm not wrong --- just ""EARLY"".)   As of Friday, the program still likes BPL;  Maybe it's keying off the low price VL 11.1 P/E and 15% yield which is suspiciously generous.Time will tell.  My program has been known to be wrong 30% of the time although last year's study had the model portfolio growing at a 39% CAGR compared with a 7.98 CAGR for the  Value Line 1 ranked stocks.",
I've been adding to my position while the market continues to discount this gem... The naysayers continue to compare BPL to div cutters and ignore the company's history and culture of providing stability to its unit-holders as a core value.,
"I’m very familiar with all these companies that claim their dividend or distribution is sanctified and will ‘not cut it’, yet as history shows, one or 2 quarters after they still do. I mean look at KMI, GE, ETP, NS, WPZ, PAA (twice), and so many others. At times management is too arrogant to accept what really needs to be done for a company reset. BPL is in that boat right now, whether a cut is in store, which personally I hope there will be, as I can see the price stabilizing after that happens, and in perhaps 6 months we may see it reversing towards the upside, as history shows the same pattern with every single MLP that has done that. Until then, I do not see a clear bottom, as this remains a very high yield screaming high risk stock; and there are much better safer options out there. Time will tell.",

"Bonaire - IMO they are blind batch building.  There is a lot of sophistication required in supply chain / component inventory control needed for build to order.  Doing it in lower volumes is one thing, production hell is another.   Build to order is a natural constraint to abandon.

Since they are not doing that, we can logically assume that those lots are not normal and Tesla is hurting. Opening up the orders was a sign that Tesla is running out of high option customers on their waiting list. That can explain lots of the cars on the lots.

"One simple question.How many cars were built in June and July without a named-customer tag on them?  If blind batch building, I don't think they are ready for that.

If the first year isn't all named-customers, something is heroically wrong.Is the need to make cars to print a production number that important?  Looks like it is.  Make quality or you will lose quantity as the customers turn away.  Especially at this ""critical time"" to keep showing the growth.

"Anton:Your analysis of the worst case scenario makes sense within the assumption set you provided. It may not be reasonable to ask given that you or your firm/sponsor are short Tesla, but would you consider running your analysis under the more optimistic assumption set including the assumption that the completed units, or at least 90% of them, are in fact already spoken for? In High School, this would have been called a compare and contrast paper, under 5,000 words, and I would have been given 4 days to complete it, thus ruining my weekend. I’m new to SA, so I’m not sure if this request is appropriate - sorry for any inadvertent rudeness.Also, although you start out your article by qualifying it as merely one way to interperet a known fact pattern, you conclude it by saying what your audience should expect as if your assumption set were in fact....um...fact.  Perhaps qualifying your conclusory statement might lend it more weight/credibility? “So now you know what to expect on the August 1 quarterly financial results conference call.” is quite definitive and kind of looks like a blurb seeking quotation. Again, you are short, and I’m more inclined to go long (with a sub 1% portfolio purchase) on the next dip below 280, and I’m considering purchasing one of a model S,X, or M3P for my upcoming 50th birthday, so perhaps my request is unreasonable.

"Most new car buyers do not order a custom car. Instead they view what is available on the lot at several dealers. Ultimately the car they purchase will be a mixture of perhaps holding line on the color choice, but forego certain options and perhaps taking some options they did not want.

Rather than configure an order, let the buyers see what’s available, let them pick one and deliver within 2 days. Why make it any more mysterious than that. Also, let the buyers make an offer on existing inventory, not just pay pure sticker price, which also a fact of life in the car biz. Is Tesla accepting trade ins on Model 3?  If so there is wiggle room there. The fact there is no lease program is a really big negative as well. Particularly since real lease companies can get the FIT rebate and pass it on to a buyer now. They will get the entire $7,500 even if the leasor doesn’t owe that much in Federal Tax.",

"Not a bad analysis, but I might offer a couple of other items to consider...-A lot of people with Model 3 reservations had initially received an expected delivery date that is, in many cases, still months away, so the sudden availability (of the more expensive versions) make a quick decision more difficult;-It does make business sense for Tesla to make the most profitable versions available first in order to bring in much-needed cash, and, as you stated, these may not hold the broader appeal of the cheaper version. Tesla may also want the “sexier” versions out there to stir up interest in buyers that are on the fence",

(That's a joke... sort of) This is turning into a plain old CAR COMPANY. And, it needs fresh capital to keep operating. Even if margins on the M3 miraculously jump to 25% in Q3, it still may not be enough to offset the losses incurred selling 25k model S&X plus all their substantial SG&A overhead. Warranty losses could be higher than expected on the first 50k M3's delivered (Yet another item to consume what little cash they have left) And, they will have to juggle the logistics of end of year deliveries so people get the full FIT. And that's where a lack of order lead times muddies the picture. If I order this one, will I get it by the end of the year? What if I order that one? ... In Blue? Assuming the current 2 - 4 month lead times hold steady, I expect orders will drop measurably around mid-September. That means increasing potential for rising inventory, which again, consumes what little cash they have left. Their biggest capital raise so far has been $2B. I've heard that they need that much just to keep going. Of course, the situation at Tesla may be much more robust than the bears expect and the Bulls will enjoy the day. Then again, INTC beat and guided higher, and got crushed because of another delay.",

Management's track record so far seems to be mixed at best.  I give them credit for not raising their NEOS Pharmaceuticals offer (look where NEOS is now!).

Management appears far too comfortable living off the cash buildup from Queen et al royalties to be meaningfully and hungrily engaged in the intense and demanding PE work which they claim to be undertaking on behalf of shareholders.I hope Seven Seas & others are increasing pressure - perhaps rallying a proxy challenge to Management compensation structure would be a good next step.However, if Management was truly aligned with shareholders, they could squeeze the large and sustained over 10% short float position with a meaningfully large buyback and then pursue deals using PDLI stock as currency.

"One thing nobody is thinking of. This could possibly be the best short squeeze of all time. Everyone sees the 5m loan as the end for HMNY and hence the 70% decline today to a market cap of 2m.  Every single share right now is short, posts above saying they couldnt get shares even at 20. Those shorts at 20 made their money and want to exit this 2m market cap due to lack of liquidity. Stock is up 15% ah at the time of writing this. Should they file for bankruptcy before shorts could exit what would happen? Would the stock still trade when they filed? My point is if 95% of the float is short, and all shorts want to end their position immediately after bk is filed which wouldn't be possible, creating the best short squeeze of all time. Or would this all be wrong and they simply halt trading?",
"The loan by Hudson Bay smells really fishy. Here is why. Ted and the boys at Hmny know that 6 million will last only about a week at most, so the purpose of this loan was not meant  to further the long term future of the company.When this money runs out in about  a week , bankruptcy is inevitable.The creditors of HMNY will consist of those who are owed money because of goods and services that they sold to HMNY, its pension obligations and now one debtor,Hudson Bay.And the primary asset of HMNY ,its % 92 ( or maybe even higher ownership of MP)will be divided among these creditors, with current shareholders getting ZERO,NADA.After paying off the other creditors Hudson Bay will own HMNYs share of MP for a little more than 6 m. This is much less than investors would have paid for any ATM secondary stock offering  and will result in Hudson Bay owning all of HMNY Hudson Bay will quickly raise prices  for MP subscribers and institute more surcharges for heavy users and for popular movies. Although this will result in a substantial decline in the number of MP subscribers, the company will be close to break even.After the dust settles MP will either be sold or will IPOED in Canada.Basically Ted and Hudson Bay will have stolen MP from current shareholders of HMNY",

"The main questions to answer:1) What is actual cash today following the ATM issuances which have been running daily at ever decreasing prices. A: no one knows until they report earnings, which is why it sells off every day2) But... what if the company shows it now has +$80mm cash raised after all the dilution, And has brought its monthly burn rate below $20mm with new anti-fraud procedures?3) then the company possibly sets up for a M-Cap of $10mm, admittedly <1yr runway to start monetizing its >3mm userbase (or perhaps one of its next movies won’t be as bad as Gotti4) .... yes the comparisons to DRYS are painfully obvious, and correct... but don’t be surprised if at some point this company has a +200% day (whether or not you’re up on when you purchased is a different matter).

They're screwed. New terminals are for 4-9% of current production capacity.  All volumes switching to brown. CRR confirmed that E+P doesn't care at all what they are pumping into new wells. E+P is pumping mud and dirt as ROI is huge. Zero need for NW anymore. They are now totally disregarding NW ""efficiency""/cost saving studies.  WTI/Brent and gasoline are rolling over after shooting star monthly candles. Despite all the middle East rhetoric from SA newbies, oil is unfortunately headed to the $40's. This will have a HUGE demand on sand demand. Sand demand and ""take or pay"" contracts will be caught in a free fall. Unfortunately, this is the biggest value trap that I've seen in years. It hurts to see that kids were heavily promoting these stocks via articles on Seeking Alpha a day or two ahead of earnings :(  EMES:  ""We experienced a minor slowdown to finish the second quarter, and the softness has partially continued into early third quarter. ....we acknowledge that the frac sand industry faces a state of transition with the utilization of new in-basin plants increasing throughout the year.""FYI- EMES is in the process of laying off workers at 2 of its NW plants....",
"Today's disappointing earnings report forced me to re-evaluate my position in EMES..... but using management's guidance of $1.66 earnings this year and street estimates of $1.90 next year, and a current price of $6.56, you're looking at 4 times earnings for this year and even lower for next. So I'll grit my teeth and hang on. I think the next 12 months are going to play out a little better than management's conservative earnings report indicates.",

the legend as usual... spot on,
Significant revenue miss by SLCA.  Way too much enthusiasm in the sector currently. The sector is a very clear value trap. New lows in the months ahead are in the cards.  Analyst upgrades or wildly bullish SA articles the days leading into earnings are the kiss of death.,

Railroad conference calls confirming a significant fall in sand rail demand for H2. CRR confirming the same in their call.

"@Holmes Osborne , I didn't find anything about their competitors in the Barron's article. I know one which is superior to Boskalis, it is Ackermans & Van Haren. This Belgian corporation (close to the Netherlands), is less cyclical, because 17% of its revenue is coming from recurrent businesses (commercial real estate, and private banking). Also, they aren't involved in the oil & gas offshore activity. I think the latter is the biggest drag (no pun intended) on Boskalis. So I think, it is not such a good pick, as it implies a bet on this industry recovery.The competing dredging corporations are either not public, or part of civil engineering/builders groups. It isn't easy to find a ""pure"" stock in this domain. GLDD is quite small, and therefore can't be considered for international projects (Great Lakes mostly).",

Somebody is going to have to navigate a fine line between what's acceptable and what amounts to censorship, which may vary from country to country. The China situation will be interesting here.

I have never owned FB because I don’t feel that it provides any significant value. If they start paying dividends I’ll rethink but right now I put it in the same category as bitcoin. I’m not a dividend investor either. I just like to be able to look at a company and understand the value proposition of their products and services. The bottom line is that Facebook is annoying.",

I had reduced a large position prior to the news that hit the stock, based on a theory that I had too much and the future of FB had become somewhat less certain. I sold the remaining shares on the theory that it is impossible to calculate how deep a spike down will be since it is partially irrational. The cash was reinvested in other high growth stocks. There is more than one fish in the sea. When a company pays zero dividend it had better have very high odds on future growth. I agree with the author that there is no hurry to get back in. FB will probably trade sideways until it shows something positive. In the meantime we can take our time and research the stock, picking some indicators to keep an eye on for any future buy.",

There is no way to get away from Facebook - it is everywhere.  I also think Facebook management used the 2nd quarter financials as an opportunity to 'kitchen sink' a whole bunch of negative financial issues - and management also 'guided down' to make it far easier to 'beat' in the 3rd quarter.  (sandbagging).  I have been in and out out FB stock several times.  I wanna get back in around $170 because I see a nice beat and price pop ahead for the 3rd quarter.,

FB is not ""undervalued to the point of irrationality.""There has been legitimately bad news and guidance that casts doubts on the long term growth potential of the company.Since it is priced for growth (although not as much as Netflix and AMZN), it is far from certain that FB longs will enjoy above-average returns at current prices.I believe that it is most likely SLIGHTLY undervalued at this point, and a buy.It is a wide-moat company with a great balance sheet and business model.But understand that it has already undergone great price appreciation the last few years and is not so undervalued as the author contends.",

The expected 5 year PEG ratio of Facebook is only 1.10.To me that means that Facebook is attractively priced.,
"Incisive as always, thank you. Present developments are typical of maturing businesses. And the fact that Mark Zuckerberg and his team are dedicated to the idea the social utility will be good business looking past a single quarter is a benefit, not a detriment, to long term value.

"Please look at the forward numbers - FB FCF per share is likely to be flat for the next 18-24 months. So why bother holding it? And who knows what happens with their top-line in 2 years?Revenue is decelrating to maybe 25% y-o-y and opex is accelerating with 50% pace! There are still good growers to stick around like V, MA, PayPal to name a few. Amazon for brave. Some smaller software companies (however valuations are elevated there).",

"I sat down all Wednesday morning thinking to sell ahead of earnings in case of a dip and buy back. I got in April at 170. Granted no one in their wildest dreams would've seen a 20-25% decline. I held on mostly for tax reasons and a potentially mediocre return if I sold and re bought in case  of 5-10% down at worst case scenario. Even with the 20% decline I don't regret my decision anymore (I did for 24 hours or so) :). A-I never entered the stock market to day trade, even if it would've worked out for me this time massively it's a slippery slope on the long term. B- I didn't buy in fb for a couple of months return no matter how big, I genuinely believe this company invented social media and targeted advertising, 2 enormous ground breaking life changing concepts and I want to be part of it 5-10 years from now. There's a lot of good stocks to own for the next 2-5 years but FB in my humble opinion is the only one out there now with 10-20 year potential.",

FB will continue to makes lots of $$ it may just start coming more from Instagram and other areas. I still maintain it can be around $220 by year end .,
It's not FB the company that concerns me.  The market hates predicted decelerating revenue growth and operating margins in any industry.  Hats off to Zuck for trying to tell what he thinks will be the truth when I'm sure he was well aware the market would hate it.,
"As a investor in FB, I personally think that FB given the scrutiny it is under in the public eye at this moment, it almost feels like the CFO deliberately made the share price tank, paint the picture worrisome. Now is not the time to show off huge profits, imagine the outcry if they knocked out the park, especially with mid-terms round the corner. The company is taking a long term approach, understanding now is not the time to have record quarters, but focus on future, investing in innovation, a better product, and lets not forget they have over $40b in cash to spur more growth.",

"I disagree with the premise of this article and I hate that because I own the stock. It appears to me there will be a rather long horizon of ""buying opportunity"" ahead. Keeping my powder dry, though I do have limit orders currently in at 160, just in case. I would not mind adding some to my position at that point but in a projected slower growth environment, price is everything. If I am wrong, I keep my cash and risk none. I'm good with that, too.FB is still fundamentally a good company but facing headwinds. Whether that makes it attractive from a price perspective remains to be seen - and it'll be awhile. My own rating is hold.. Personally, I see no signs of accumulation right now. Selling FB as a prospective dividend stock to me is difficult, because I already own stocks like F (6% yield) and AGNC (11.15%) in the dividend sector of my portfolio. FB has to return to being a growth stock to sustain interest. Gonna take time. Your mileage may vary. :-)",
I’m no fb fan but as a business owner they have such a big advantage over their competition. I begrudgingly advertise on fb because it’s so much more effective than anywhere else. Fb has no incentive to have knock out profit reports and I think is intentionally spending. Hell they are donating $5 for everyone’s birthday if they want. At any point they could cut spending and increase profit but right now due to regulatory issues there’s no motivation to do that. That’s why I really think the important metric is revenue growth and knowing that anytime they want they can increase margins,

"As many have stated, part of SWIR's challenge is based upon the market.  The biggest driver of the market is yet to fully mature.  That driver is big data analytics.  The news seems t be scope locked on connected cars which is nothing more than a drop in the bucket compared to the real market potential.  I watch companies like HDP and CLDR to understand the demand for big data analytics capabilities.  This is where the data acquired through connected things provide savings, and income to change existing businesses and give birth to new ones.  Recently BP purchased $10 Billion in US share reserves from BHP.  BHP a mining company, not an oil or natural gas company lost money since the day they acquired those assets.  What drove BP to invest in this when BHP could not make a profit?  The linked article shows how IoT including big data analytics moved BP to a path of profitability.  finance.yahoo.com/...  This is just one example out of hundreds of thousands of IoT applications we will see making these huge transformations.  Will the new Sierra CEO be able to capitalize on these?  I'm optimistic.",

You got to be concerned. 2% in OEM is bad with all the iot hype. Ok let’s say it’s not caught fire yet. Organic growth of 28.8% on cloud? If you move from percentages that’s 2 million and they’ve claimed currency Xchange to be a part of that. That brings us to NMRX. Everyone knows nmrx was free falling.

It’s been 7 months and sierra website still shows the old nmrx products with outdated technology.Enterprise: while it has been good mgmt themselves say the growth will not be same as the regulatory items are met.

"This story sounded good four years ago when I first bought SWIR. Unfortunately, the story is still the same except they never delivered on it. Even then they were claiming to be market leader of whatever they define as their niche. 4 years later they still claim the same (I think even the market share is eternally nailed to about 33%), yet growth is anemic. So it appears SWIR managed to identify the only apart of the ostensibly exploding IOT market that is stagnating. No wonder investors are losing patience with them. IOT definitely is an interesting market, I just don't see how that will translate into success for SWIR if they haven't figured out how to make it one in the last 4 years.",

That removes a lot of naive and/or nervous shareholders.2) Tax laws (like it or not) imply imply EPS and continued share repurchase. Luca was clear that they will buy back a lot more than ""just"" $100B. Perhaps another 30% of the shares over 5 years.One more: Apple raised dividends by 16% or $.40 per year. They will sustain one of those, 16% or $.40. At a 25% payout ratio (without factoring in future buybacks), dividend growth is safe.",
Apples purchasing power is one big exciting element for me. I’ve owned Apple for almost seven years now and while they haven’t made big splashes with buys they have the ability to do so. One morning you could wake up to game changing news. They are producing a lot of content for their streaming launch. Disney is making waves and they are very friendly with Apple.

Apple has share to get but the market growth won't drive the Apple they way it used to. MY strong belief is they need another big growth engine. They ought to be Netflix/Disney and they can drive scale that few others can in users who crave top entertainment. I recommended Apple buy Disney ten years ago.

It's human nature to want to tear down things that threaten one's self worth, meaning Apple being so strong in so many ways provokes a sort of sibling rivalry response and the result it a disproportionate amount of negativity.

Silver will move higher since it is used in many products. Thanks for the commentary and data.,
"I posted this on the forum  “5 reasons to avoid Silver - a devils advocate”Folks. The price of silver is not determined by actual demand. It matters not a bit how many solar panels need it. The price is determined by the Comex and how many paper shorts are thrown at it when needed. Since the Comex allows unlimited shorting actual supplies of silver mean nothing. The smart money uses this fact to drive down the price with paper and then buy long and take delivery of hard silver. Follow the smart money and buy when they are long, which happens to be the case right now. That’s the easy part. The hard part is when to sell. Will the next rally be capped again at $1 or $2 gain or not? Make a small gain or wait for the real rally? My advice: Take a bit of the table when it rises and use the profits to buy low again. If it continues to rise you still make money with the portion you didn’t sell.This program takes patience which is lacking nowadays- mostly with speculators, but also investors. For long term investors another story. I still have some silver that I bought between $6 and $12 dollars. I sold some (but not enough it seems) at $40 and $30. I also have $25 dollar silver because I didn’t understand how manipulated the market was back then.For hard silver I like the 1kg Australien coins. For ETF I use PSLV instead of SLV. PSLV is currently selling at a discount. SLV allows shorting and may not have the real goods on hand. The price tracks the silver price using paper derivatives. It is abused by the same smart money mentioned above. I do own SILJ and dollar cost average on it using the same strategy mentioned above.Follow the money don’t fight it. Do what JPMorgan does. They have never lost in silver.",
"Imo it is much better to buy the best value stocks within SILJ individually rather than buying SILJ. Currently AG, CDE, TAHO, and HL, are great values. So is ASM, although  ASM is missing from SILJ. SILJ is rather illiquid, and the SILJ management fee is best avoided.I don't see such great upside potential for PAAS at its current price, however if it declines enough I might want to buy some PAAS shares.

And if they do a surprise big spot devaluation (like back in Summer 2015), gold/silver may crash for the short term.",

"A brief update for the casual follower/investor in PCOM -- the company posted an excellent quarter on Wed 8/8.Most impressive, Loyalty Currency Retailing (i.e., BGT) delivered $6.7 million in adjusted EBITDA 2Q18, up 34% year over year.  For the first 6 months of 2018, BGT EBITDA increased 35.3% to $13.2 million – very impressive given that management has previously targeted full year BGT EBITDA of $20 million!  On a trailing 12 month basis, BGT EBITDA totaled approximately $24.2 million – 20% higher than the company’s $20 million annual target.  Given the strong BGT results, PCOM raised the midpoint of full year adjusted EBITDA guidance  -- expected annual growth improves to 30-40% from 20-40%.The two newer initiatives (Platform and Travel) continue to move in the right direction as they progress through the build out phase that every start up business goes through.  For almost every business, the build out phase requires a period of investment (i.e., negative cash flow) in order to produce/realize future profits/cash flow…business 101.  I have no idea if Platform and Travel will achieve the company’s goals but each business continues to add credible partners and grow revenues.  I fully support the company’s efforts to build out these businesses and short term negative cash flow related to these initiatives is insignificant to the long-term investment outlook for PCOM.  Worst case – Platform and Travel both get shut down at some point in the future and we are left with a highly profitable and growing Loyalty Currency Retailing business..",
"Priceline?  What does that have to do with anything?  Another announcement, like the MasterCard announcement, that was meaningless.

So the stock may be a steal at 12 or so.  Points Travel? Another pie-in the-sky boondogle.  Margins moving down over the years.  A tough slog for sure. Cut the head count, stop thinking you are the next Grubhub and run the business like it should be run.  I wonder who paid 18 a share?  I'm grateful.",
Texas Investor - The problem is while we agree that the BGT  is a decent business the issue is as an investor in the stock you dont get much benefit from it as they have been spending much of those cash flows into other areas that have yet to bear fruit.   At some point they need to make a decision as to which area to focus on if points travel and platform dont take off .  Just think about how much more valuable your shares would be if they only focussed on BGT that past 5 years. It would be much higher.,
I agree w/  Texas Investor on BGT the business is a nice cash flow business which has low capex. Quite attractive as long as the market for that product continues.  I simply think some of the pie in the sky dream scenarios for this stock to rapidly go up many multiples quickly surely will need something major to start working outside of BGT.  So far there is no evidence of it which is a shame because the network they have is very unique and they should have figured it out by now.   I am very curious to watch over next 24 quarters if maybe they can gain traction in some of these new business lines.,
"The million dollar question with this company is and has always been the same.  On the surface what they offer as it relates to a plug and play access to all their loyalty partners networks is very very interesting. But why after 20 years of trying have they not been able to make anything of it.  No matter how many new things they try, no matter how much money and resources they throw at it, why are they not yet able to crate and meaningful economics form anything outside of BGT ?   They have been at this a very very long time this is not a recent start up.   Even a few years ago they were wildly bullish on their new platform and points travel initiatives but the platform actually appears to be shrinking from a very low leave as it never took off and points travel continues to be slow to turn into anything of substance.  There must be a reason why nothing ever sticks as it always seems on the surface like these offering make sense for other businesses to use.   Also it seems like they have tried to sell this thing a few times and never found any buyers that also makes one wonder.  Unfortunately we will never really know all the answers here as mgmt is not transparent on these issues.Looks to me like the Chairman left the company likely so he could freely sell off his stake.

There was an indication from the last earnings release and subsequent call that management was going to focus on increasing profits more.

"I agree with Florida's comments regarding the analysis and choice of valuation metrics. Nevertheless, and despite the recent run, the model is intriguing and potential returns here are substantial as this sector undergoes transformation. It is not a travel play. It is a brand loyalty and customer rewards management platform. A number of applications are evolving to serve customer rewards and fan engagement space driven by behavioral economics and tokenized currencies. Along with fintech, customer loyalty and engagement is a big area of focus for blockchain technology and in some cases incentives can be tokenized as well. PCOM, by design or not, effectively does just this as an airline service bureau and will be a big beneficiary of the expansion into other industries and potentially other tokens as awareness builds and more non-airline mile tokens are created. It trades at attractive multiples of EBITDA and EPS relative to growth expectations but, most importantly, as a special situation is subject to a substantial re-rating as this space transforms.",
You clearly have zero understanding of this business.  You somehow think company makes their money as an OTA and are trying to value it that way. Points makes over 100% of its profits (and the vast majority of its revenue) from reselling airline miles.  This is called their BGT business (buy gift transfer) I say they make over 100% of profits from this part of the business because they still loose money and have negligible revenues in the other parts of the business like points travel which is what you are talking about.   Also using a price to sales valuation is absurd because of how they account for revenue in BGT.  If they sell $100 million of miles in BGT they count that as $100 mln in revenue but it is a reseller business so they are buying those miles form the issuer from about $93 mln or sale.  If you want to use a price to sales multiple you would need to do it on true sales which is less than 10% of what they call revenue.  This is why nobody that understands this business would ever consider using a price to sales multiple.  Not a very well researched article.,Points International: A Solid Long-Term Bet

It is also important to note that the Utica play is 7000 to 3000 feet below the Marcellus, therefore it is far more expensive to tap the Utica, compared to the Marcellus.  So CHK has offloaded all of those expenses in favor of the more efficient, less costly, more abundant play in the Marcellus.  And they will use the nearly $2B to pay down debt to further reduce expenses, etc.CHK will be returning all of the ng production offset, and then some, in a short period of time, while they continue to increase oil production in Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk, and Powder River as well.This was a smart move.I added more on Friday, and will continue adding throughout 2H18.",

The enphase automatic transfer switch is where the public grid & the enphase micro grid are either tied together or segregated.That is where the physical connection takes place.,
@rickjansen link did not work but you did point me in the right direction. thanks.enphase.com/...see the drawing on page 2 of the link.A typical grid tied system is depicted by enphase.The micro inverters are responsible for disconnecting the panels from the utility AC power during an outage.The ac loads (the power outlets in your house) are also going to be dead for the duration of the outage in that drawing.Rewiring that to allow stand alone micro grid functionality during an outage will be an additional expense. Maybe a prohibitive expense in my case.We shall see.,
"Here is a description on how Enphase microinverters limit production to achieve zero-feedback to the grid: enphase.com/...–-hei-self-supply-compliance?destination=%2Fen-us%2Fsupport%2Fsolar-professionals%2Fdownloads%3Ffield_type%3D219 (pdf)""An Enphase system can support Customer Self Supply by using a special CSS profile and an IQ Envoy with consumption CTs installed at/near the utility service location. When configured for CSS, the Enphase system still automatically limits the PV generation so that no energy is exported to grid.""""The Enphase Energy Management System uses data collected by the or IQ Envoy consumption and production meters and automatically adjusts the output of the microinverters anytime that the output of the PV system is capable of exceeding the sites consumption needs. This power curtailment functionality is essential to maximize the system output while limiting the export of power to the grid. These adjustments to microinverter power output are sent from the Envoy over the powerline, meaning there is no need for external communications to be installed. Pulling data from the consumption meter every 500ms and making adjustments to microinverter output at 1.5 second intervals, an IQ Envoy with self-consumption enabled will consistently react to inadvertent export events in two to four seconds, well within the 30 seconds allotted by the utility.""All this does not need an IQ8. I'm sure there is a physical disconnect the moment the grid fails.",

"Several points stand out about the Prescience piece:P.8.  ""In Q3 2017, ENPH’s warranty expenses totaled just $0.2m or 0.3% of sales. This was almost 90% lower than its average quarterly warranty expenses from FY 2014 to Q2 2017 of $2.1m or 2.5% of sales [...]""    Enphase has introduced several product families since 2014: M250, M215-IG, IQ6, and currently is transitioning to IQ7.  Each new family has brought with it significant improvements in reliability.   The authors of the piece seem to either not understand (or believe) these facts, and instead would have ENPH accrue warranty expenses at rates which would be more adequate for the M190 family -- a product known to have had reliability issues.P.9.  ""ENPH’s gross margin in Q4 2017 was even more inflated than it was in Q3 2017 [and the whole section that follows]"".   Here again, the piece repeats the assumption that GM was inflated due to warranty under accrual and a questionable decision to accelerate amortization of deferred revenue.   While I can't comment on the details or rationale for the deferred revenue amortization, 4Q17 coincides with the company fully transitioning to the IQ6 platform -- a much lower cost product -- while refraining from chasing its competitors down in price.  It's easy to see how holding prices up, while fully realizing the benefits of selling a lower-cost product would drive margins up.P.12. ""On the surface, the massive increase in gross margin ENPH reported in Q1 2018 simply did not add up. Consider that from Q2 2017 to Q1 2018,ENPH’s revenue declined by 6.3% from $74.7m to $70.0m, while during that same timeframe its inverter volume also declined by 21.2% from775K to 611K"".   This one may be a little trickier to explain. How can revenues (volume) decline alongside with cost? (lower volume, lower economies of scale, etc.).  Recall two points: 1)  the IQ6 product was designed almost single-mindedly to decrease BOM cost: fewer parts, simpler manufacturing process, polymeric enclosure, a two-conductor cable (this is nearly 50% savings in the cable, down from the 4-conductor cable in the M2XX product); and 2) that ENPH does not own its manufacturing, but instead it manufactures its products at a variety of contract manufacturers.  Therefore, the cost of its BOM is related to, yes, its volume, but also its ability to negotiate effectively with its CMs (CMs have nearly infinite volume of almost anything in a a given product's BOM) -- Is it possible that ENPH new management was able to strike better deals with its CMs?... From here on, the authors of the piece continue to harp on more or less similar themes and rationale (the insistence on the application of historical accruals, skepticism over the value of supply-chain optimizations) and assumptions of wrong-doing as management apparently changed policy for how to accrue for software revenue. ... P.27. ""When An Acquisition Is Not Really An Acquisition: ENPH Is Paying SPWR To Be Its Customer"" On its face, it would appear as if ENPH over-paid for the SPWR deal.  However, what the authors don't seem to appreciate (not sure many analysts do, actually), is that ENPH will  introduce its grid-agnostic product (IQ8) in 2019, and with it, storage.  IQ8 and its successors should pull with them additional storage revenue from SPWR's customers (a grid-agnostic/grid-independent inverter is not very useful without storage -- as it would only produce grid-independent energy during the daytime).Frankly, after looking at the points highlighted above and a few others, I lost interest and stopped reading.  40+ pages of the type of analysis gets to be a little much.  I found the piece repetitive, very biased, and overall lacked credibility for the reasons above.  It seems like a ""hit piece"" aimed at benefiting from shorting ENPH.",
"This is the first time I have looked at Enphase.  The article and the comments are fascinating and enlightening.  I wish I had looked at it a year or more ago.  I like growth stocks with technical advantages in a growth industry, especially if the financials have a chance to bend and grow from where they are.  In the end the battle of words is won with the best products.Thanks to all who commented from a technical perspective and a financial perspective.  I am definitely going to put it on a watch list and do some more research.  Good luck to all.",
"By picking this article, does the editor means to ensure its credibility?",
Tuesday will be enlightening....,
The problem with ENPH is that they tend to over promise and under deliver. I found the pp article thorough and believable. I am not ignoring possibility of IQ8     for ENPH future. But I do not want to cope with uncertainties.,
Driving using only the rear view mirror is not advised...... Feel sorry for those that believe this tripe,
PP thanks for the articleLong ENPH and looking to accumulate,
"Can someone point me to the page in enphase 2017Q3 10-k where the warranty obligations were 0.2MM? As accused by PP? I read in 2017Q4 this: In 2017, primarily in the fourth quarter, the Company recorded the impact of further product-cost reduction initiatives for its sixth generation microinverters, which are backwards compatible with previous microinverter generations and will be used to fulfill future warranty obligations for all microinverter generations in the field. This resulted in a $2.2 million decrease to warranty expense related to estimated future replacement costs. The Company also recorded, primarily in the third quarter, a decrease to warranty expense of $1.9 million for labor reimbursement costs expected to be paid to third party installers performing replacement services for its second generation product as a result of a change in its reimbursement policy. In addition, the Company recorded additional warranty expense of $3.9 million based on continuing analysis of field performance data and diagnostic root-cause failure analysis primarily relating to its second generation product.",
All this is not correct in our financial system for an article like this to be published and effect all the weak players.I have never been a  person to sue a company or individual however now may be the time is it worth it?The author of the article has really set himself up for this all involved in the solar business know the history of Enphase from the shaky start with a capacitor in the initalize design was their Achilles heal that solved years ago.I suspect Thurman Rodgers will see this guy face to face in the court room and the outcome of a financial decision will not be in favor of the author of the inital report.I see Jim Jenal and the owner of Solar kings in Florida also posting guys that built companies with their on sweat on rooftops commenting ok PP enjoy yourself before you go to bed tonight look in the mirror are you really pleased at what is looking back at you?,
"Darn-I got swayed by their IQ8 product to come. Bought at 7+ and unloaded today based on the PP news. Better a small loss than when it goes back to $1. ENPH is a dangerous stock-equity is negative. That means, if the Co goes bankrupt-the stock holders will recoup big O. Zilch!!!",
"Thanks, interesting read. The future will show if you were right.",
"LOVING this hit-piece by @Prescience Point !  I was far too conservative when I invested 300k at $.95. It’s a decision that’s haunted me as I’ve watched the steady climb to $7, so quite naturally, I’ve been scanning the horizon for an anomalous event that would create a significant pullback. If we could get the share price close to your $1 PT, I’ll be able to purchase an additional half million worth of shares. This would be FANTASTIC.  Please DM if you need help or just want to brainstorm additional ways we can get low-info investors to sell, I’ve got a few ideas...Cheers!P.S.Your persuasion tactics 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 round of applause.- The “shock and awe” of such a long-winded article:  I’m not sure I’ve ever seen such a lengthy SA article in all my years as a reader. The sheer volume of words will go a long way to convince casual investors that you are in possession of an undiscovered accounting cheat and that your research is exhaustive and legitimate. 👍🏽- Also, linking Chatila and the $SUNE BK saga with Enphase—- breathtaking piece of theatre.  Uninformed, weak hands are surely in freakout mode as we speak. This will go a long way to help our cause of driving the stock down. 👌🏽Thanks for your help!",
OP probably wants to buy more at a lower price.  bet they shorted it.,
"So what is next?  Legal investigations? Is there a  financial / stock trading watchdog keeping an eye on this? The allegations in this article cannot go unanswered, can they? And if the article itself is a scam that is very bad too.",
A view on the product: Enphase makes the best solar cells and equipment in the US at the current point in time and works with the Tesla II battery. I have this system installed in my house and love it. The micro inverters and inverter etc. work very smooth. I sold enphase shares a while ago realizing a superb gain. If this blows up because of such reports I will happily rebuy but at current price ENPH is possibly richly priced.,
"Ok, so why is this article wrong in soooo many ways?''In Q1 2018, ENPH's revenue per inverter increased by a mind-boggling 19.9% YoY. This amounts to proof, in our view, that ENPH's Q1 2018 results were significantly overstated, as this anomalous increase is far out of line with historical trends and does not reconcile with management's projection of a 2% ASP decline per quarter in FY'18.''Let's start here, good as place as any.So why is this wrong in sooooo many ways and what could possibly be going on rather than three Billionaire backers risking their reputation to make a few bucks by cheating?Ok....first off, everyone expected ASP's to decline 7 to 10% per year last year because historically that is what they've done.  SEDG's Sella said the same thing.  Yet what happened?  They didn't...they were flat.  Why?  Because new rules required basic string to add on features (increasing prices) while SEDG, already compliant, just took the extra margin money and ran with it (their margins have moved up over the last year).  Meanwhile, ENPH (already compliant with new rules) and losing money, had no intention of starting a price war with anyone.  The bottom line is ASP's were flat...something no one predicted.Second,  ENPH's prior CEO dropped prices like a rock in 2016 (twice the rate of the market) to try and drum up sales.  He succeeded, but drove margins and earnings into the gutter by doing it.  Margins dropped from the 30% range to 18% range.  All this changed when he was replaced with their new CEO.  He beleives, like I do, that ENPH has a vastly surperior product and should not have been cutting prices.  He stopped this practice.  In C.C's he called this ''chopping off the low hanging fruit''.  What he did was stop the prior CEO's practice of cutting prices to take any deal on the table.  He standardized prices, and stopped giving away their product.   As a result ENPH's revenue per inverter increased, not decreased.Third, revenue by inverter increased dramatically last quarter because something else just changed...by a lot.   It was not the Envoy's or the cables that drove that drove the rest of that growth.  So what was it?Their AC battery sales are starting to warm up.   One battery sells for the price of about 17 inverters.   By my guess their battery sales accounted for over 10% of their total revenue last quarter.  ENPH does not break this out....they just say accessories.  So when P.P. was asking Garcia to spill the beans he passed on explaining why.  P.P. being new and not doing their homework....not knowing ENPH had never broke out their battery sales number.....assumed this was a cover up by Garcia/rather than a company practice.As for their warranty expense arguments.....all nonsense.  ENPH's microinverers simply do not break anymore.  Here is a site that tracks 1000's of them.  The M190 are the pre 2013 models...the M250's the 4th generation.   The other fact is almost 90% of ENPH's warranty expenses are to this day going to deal with problems relating to those models.  docs.google.com/...The Enovoy revenue recognition was required to stay current with GAAP.  If you know they are being used for 6.5 years on average then that's what you use.  If it's required that you average software over that lifetime that is what you do.  To not do that would be cheating.  As for the bottom line...read the 10Q.  The end result was revenue was up something like 400K.Then there is this...''ENPH's solution is inherently disadvantaged to SEDG's solution: From an architectural standpoint, microinverters are inherently disadvantaged to DC optimizers. Only one inverter is required per DC optimizer solar system.'''First off, when this was first written it stated ''Only one Optimizer is required per...''Which is really dumb....clearly they figured that one out after they first printed the article.  My question would be how could you do all this research and be that ignorant to think only one Optimizer (rather than the word ''inverter''/which was changed today)  was required?The bottom line is P.P. is making the same arguments as other SA authors that have previously taken pot shots at ENPH.  They are looking at financials and financials alone.  To be truthful, ENPH's current financials are easy to poke fun at it....it's a target you can't miss.But the future of ENPH is not to be found in their prior financials...it's in their product line up.To not understand why the IQ7 and IQ8 are game changers is to totally miss the boat on why to invest in ENPH.  It's why previous SA authors who recommended shorting ENPH when it was under one dollar a share ended up having their shirts handed to them.  Remember Enter Tution's article when he said ENPH was worth 2 cents and recommended shorting it?  Well, at least this guy thinks it's worth 50X that amount.",
"I think the only thing I want to comment on is the acquisition of the Sunpower business.  There are two things that you should think about as an investor:  How does this impact earnings? & How does this impact future valuation?  These are both relevant because this is a stock + cash deal.  If this was a cash-only deal, we would analyze whether this was a good way to spend cash (what is the ROI?).This deal will have a positive impact on Revenue, Gross Margin $, and EBITDA.  To get a gain of $14M - $21M in EBITDA, Enphase is only expending $25M in cash.  Within 2 years, the company will be in the black on the cash directly in the deal.For shareholders, the company will have 2 impacts today.  The Balance Sheet will be lighter by $25M and the Stock is diluted by about 7.5%.  That means that the additional earnings get divided by about 105M shares outstanding instead of about 96M shares outstanding.  This is significant because EPS and EPS growth is the core of the business. The caution I would give you is that the deal price is not a fixed number.  Let us say that Enphase gets to $10/share at that 5-year mark and that the EBITDA is somewhere in the middle (call it $17.5M/year).  For a price of $100M, the company will have gained $87.5M in profit.This is a very good deal for Enphase Mangement because it improves the operating business (the Income Statement).  It is a good deal for Sunpower, because they can benefit from the potential upside in the stock and they got to get some upfront cash and they got to eliminate a number of employees.  It is unclear whether it is a good deal for Enphase shareholders as we don't know the opportunity cost of the deal.  They have landed a new customer exclusively, but could they have spent the money better other ways?  Not sure.",
"As a homeowner, I selected Enphase two years ago for a small 1 kw research project. After a year, I expanded to 6 kw. This year I have purchased the equipment to almost triple the size of my system. As I've done all of the work myself, I became very familiar with the equipment.I was impressed enough with the hardware quality and performance, that while I am an unsophisticated investor, I have purchased Enphase stock. I find this very negative article troubling, but it was the hardware which sold me on the company. I'm not budging.",
I LOVE FINDING HOLES IN SHORT ARTICLES.THEY CAN BE SO DESPERATE.GOOD LUCK TO ALL. LONG ENPH!!!,
"Great summary PP. You beat me too it. Hopefully SeekingAlpha publishes my article as I believe it is a simpler and easier to digest version of the comprehensive work you've provided. Anyone that's long this stock based on the next ""product cycle"" is missing the forest for the trees if they think accounting shenanigans don't matter. ENPH financial benefit was supposed to be in conjunction with the iQ adoption. Yes the iQ device has been adopted, and the financials have improved, but they've cheated with their reported financials. That's a huge deal.",
"I’ve expressed my surprise before in this forum on the figures they report on sales and growth in Europe, while that can only stem from M250 and M210, as later inverter models  are not available here (in Europe).  It’s now Q3, but I don’t see IQ7 available anywhere here, yet.I sincerely hope it’s not a scam, as I am looking forward to installing a system. I cannot use M250, as I need a zero feed grid setup, and that can only be done with S- and IQ-series.",
It seems quite obvious to me that this article was paid for by the short side of the trade.  With a huge short interest in the stock and Tute ownership on the rise the shorts have no way to cover before this gets away from them.  Many are well under water at this point. Tuesday's earnings call may put the final nail in the shorts coffin.,
Good job. Quite a convincing bear case.,
"I am a solar installer, not a financial analyst, so much of PP's argument makes my eyes glaze over.  I did, however, sit up straight over this ignorant quote:""During our diligence, we interacted with several solar product distributors and solar industry consultants. Not one felt that ENPH's product was much more reliable than SEDG's. However, there were several who felt that SEDG's product was much more reliable than ENPH's.""Nonsense.SEDG relies on a single string inverter through which all power passes.  Moreover, SEDG is also placing electronics on the roof, under each panel, just as you do with microinverters.  Thus SEDG has the worst of both worlds: electronics on the hot roof, *and* a single point of failure in the string inverter.  If it fails, the entire system goes dark.  Anyone who thinks that makes SEDG ""much more reliable"" doesn't understand reliability.Disclaimer: I have no investment position with either ENPH or SEDG; but we exclusively install Enphase and have done so since 2009.  I have seen their future product, the IQ8 in the lab, and it is mind boggling.  (I cannot be more precise due to an NDA.)  I cannot wait to offer it to my clients.",
the margins were attributed to a new microinverter product. Article is misleading from the beginning. While he might know the financials I don't think he know the products,
"Elad Asbahi of Prescience Point is good at hyping the doom and gloom.  Their quip on Huawei is wrong since Huawei will not come out with a microinverter comparable to IQ.

"I found Prescience Pt's report (Which was released on Wednesday, this is just a summary of it) to be quite convincing.  They did good analysis.  Meanwhile, my own knowledge of the dynamics of the solar inverter industry points in the same direction as their analysis.  Which is why I sold some calls short on Wednesday afternoon.  Published my analysis this morning: www.altenergystocks.com/...",
I have one question. Do you think Prescience Point Capital is reporting FAKE NEWS?,
game changers iq series.,
"Here’s my short analysis of Prescience Point:Their website lists their research articles.  I checked the stock price action for each, shortly after PP’s publication.  Here’s what I found:* Kellogg | K - April 26, 2018  -  Price is up* Celadon Group | CGI - April 5 to Dec 21, 2017 - Cannot determine, will assume that price dropped* Cheetah Mobile | CMCM - Oct 26, 2017 -  Price relatively unchanged* Stamps.com | STMP - July 4, 2016 - Price is up significantly* ULTA Salon | ULA - Feb 18, 2016 - Price is up significantly* Chicago Bridge & Iron | CBI - Jun 17, 2014 - Cannot determine what happened in 2014 or 2015, but started going down in sometime 2015* LKQ | LKQ - Jan 15, 2014 - Price is up* Fleetmatics | FLTX - Sep 19, 2013 - Cannot determine.  Most SeekingAlpha articles after PP’s article were positive.  Then FLTX got acquired.* Innerworksings | INWK - Apr 30, 2013 - Price dropped for approx. 2.5 years but has recovered most of it since then* Boulder Brands | BDBD - Feb 26 to Mar 5, 2013 - Cannot determine, was acquired.  Several bearish articles on SeekingAlpha after PP’s.  Will assume price dropped.* Active Network | ACTV - Oct 31, 2012, Feb 12, 2013 - Cannot determine.  Will assume price dropped* US Antimony | UAMY- Sep 19, 2012 -  Price was low from 1997 to 2011.  Then it popped.  Since 2012, it declined back to 1997-2011 levels.* Student Transportation | STB - July 26, 2012. - Price was flat for next 3 years, then it went down and now it is higher* Yongey | YONG - Dec 13, 2011 - Cannot determine.  However, back then, it was widely known that many of the reverse takeover listings from China were fraudulent.* China Gerui Advanced Material | CHOP - Oct 28, 2011* A-Power Energy Generation | APWR - June 27, 2011 -  Price had already been plummeting before PP’s article.Of the above, I will exclude YONG and CHOP because many people were writing negative articles about them at that time.  I will also exclude APWR.  Of the rest, I’ve been unable to find price action for 5 of them.  Of these, I’ll assume that the prices went down for 4 of them.  Of the remaining 8, I was to able find the price action for these.  Of these, price dropped for only two after PP’s articles.From their article about Enphase, here are issues I have with some of their arguments:Page 13 of Prescience Point’s (PP’s) report tries to show that Enphase recognized too much deferred revenue.However, this happened right after Enphase changed its accounting method from ASC 605 to ASC 606, which increased deferred revenue by $77.5m.  What if they didn’t change to ASC 606?  How much revenue would they have realized if they didn’t have to defer $77.5m?  The same?  More?Even if Enphase did not recognize the 6.3m of deferred revenue in Q1 2018, Enphase will eventually recognize that revenue.Page 15 of Prescience Point’s (PP’s ) report states:“In its latest 10Q, ENPH reported that Envoy billings amounted to $9.4m in Q1 2018.”In the 10Q, it actually states;“Increase due to billings  9,444,000”Does anyone know if 100% of this is from Envoy?PP says that Enphase recognized $10.6m of deferred revenue and that Enphase increased Envoy billings by $9.4m.  PP claims that these two numbers should equal.  Why should they?  The $10.6m is probably deferred in the past from prior billings and the $9.4m of new billings is to be deferred and may not be recognized until a later date.It seems flawed and illogical that they subtract 9.4 from 10.6 to claim that the difference of 1.2 is inflated revenue by Enphase.Page 16 of Prescience Point’s (PP’s) report states that revenue per inverter has increased abnormally. But it divides total revenue by number of inverters sold, without accounting for Envoy sales or how the accounting of Envoy has changed significantly in 2018 Q1.Page 28 of Prescience Point’s (PP’s) report tries to show that the transaction with SunPower was value destructive.However, it seems that PP is using an egregiously wrong way to show it.  It deducts the purchase price from the operating income before determining the “Purchase Multiple” of 34.4.  When is this ever done?That’s like saying that if you buy a stock, you should deduct the stock price (amortized over the length of time that you plan to own the stock) from the EPS before determining the P/E ratio.As an example, if you plan to buy a stock for $15 and plan to hold it for 15 years, then according to PP you should deduct $1 ($15 divided by 15 years) from the EPS before determining the P/E.  If the EPS is $2, then according to PP, the EPS should be adjusted to $1 ($2 subtract $1) and therefore the true “Purchase Multiple” (according to PP) is 15 and not 7.5.  This is flat wrong.Therefore, the “EBIT Multiple” for the SunPower transaction is 5.33 to 3.55, which is VERY VALUE ACCRETIVE.Page 32 shows “intensifying competition”.  But there is really only one competitor right now, SolarEdge.  Even if Huawei came in, there is enough market for them.  Apple is hugely successful, even though Samsung is the largest phone maker and there are several competitors, including Huaweii, LG, Xiaomi, Google, etc.  In the 1990’s, Apple almost went bankrupt because of Microsoft.Page 35 says that Enphase should be valued with the same revenue multiple that was used on 9/5/2017.  This is silly.  The market was pricing Enphase to go bankrupt on 9/5/2017.  Even PP is not saying that Enphase is going bankrupt.  This is clear example of exaggeration on the part of PP. In conclusion, PP’s has been wrong with approximately half of the companies that they criticized.  Several of PP’s claims against Enphase are either wrong, exaggerated or can be argued.  PP claims that Enphase should be priced like it is going bankrupt, even though PP did not claim that Enphase will go bankrupt.  It is possible, maybe even likely that Enphase manipulated their numbers to inflate revenue.  But there is no indication that it was illegal.  Every one of their accounting changes were reported in the SEC filings.  Besides, the revenue will eventually be recognized.  Also, the amount is insignificant compared to the extra revenue and operating income that the SunPower deal should bring in.",Enphase Energy: A Sham Turnaround

If we still have the tariff fears going on we may see lower oil prices do to the combination.,

"A good investment strategy could be to accumulate Permian producers in the anticipation of new pipelines narrowing or eliminating local price differentials. One can 'google' for proposed pipes and in service dates - here is a clip from an article just to give and idea:""""Increasing constraints and projected output have triggered a race to build or expand pipelines to deliver Permian crude to Gulf Coast refineries and export terminals. At least 2.4 MMbpd of potential new Permian oil pipeline capacity has been proposed by a half-dozen operators, and those who have progressed to open season have reported strong customer interest.""""There is about 18-24 months to buy on any weakness like Noble Energy which is down heavily today. This is just an example - it's up to individual investors which companies to pick. A similar strategy can be buying Canadian heavy oil producers but the time horizon is longer given the slow pace, about 24-36 months. Pick your names and buy on setbacks which will be plenty. Of course, investors must watch for any progress on remaining 3 pipeline projects. 2 are at the mercy of regulators and politics in Minnesota and Nebraska and may face court delays.

CPG is thoroughly reviled by long time shareholders like me for their repeated stock dilution despite management's promises not to do so.  What will make CPG shareholders really happy is if they undertake a stock buy back program especially in light of the depressed price right now.  Nothing else matters to long time shareholders.,

All major Chinese internet stocks drop big today including BABA.,
"To everyone waiting to pull the trigger on Tencent, here is the real picture even if Tencent would drop another 40% it would only be time to take a loan to load up the current problem with Tencent is the Yuan loosing steam against the greenback.  The greenback is artificially inflated because of the corporate repatriation of profits, this is going to be a temporary fix for the greenback.  The world is slowly turning it’s back on the greenback and more and more relying on other currency think of the silk road initiative the Chinese are using their US dollars to build infrastructure not to finance their debt in turn the Africa and some parts of the middle east are starting to make currency swap with the Yuan wich they convert to gold if they want.  This is the take on the Chinese part of the business.Tencent is forging its way to become the next wave of gaming consoles wich is no console at all, it as it’s tentacle on most of the world top game producers Tencent is silently building infrastructure to become the king of cloud gaming wich means no more console in 5 to 6 years the internet speeds will let you run games directly on the cloud with minimal hardware that you could only plug in a tv.  The future of social media is Gaming advertising will be displayed on you’re (think of android exploiting system on the phone) in you’re game lobby and inside the games wich are more and more becoming freeware and encouraging people to perk up their characters.  Every content provider studios are sick and tired of paying hefty fees to the likes of sony and Microsoft and cloud gaming is going to revolutionize how those content providers deal with middleman aka as Microsoft and Sony.",
Tencent (and the other Asian e-commerce businesses) will be around long after POTUS has gone.  And will be much bigger then.,
Although there are those that opine with scattered investments approach Tencent has taken its the cash they are generating that allows them to do so. When you pay $300 -$400 million for 48 % of Epic Games 5 years ago and the total revenue fortnite generates in May is $300 million it shows getting there early and being patient has value. There are more diamonds to shine. Patience has value.,
"I am not a believer myself in charts as a way to evaluate valuation and future trends for an individual stock.I do agree with the writer though that TenCent is undervalued at present.All Chinese stocks have been punished by the counter-productive threat of a trade war from Trump.The biggest reason for the depressed stock price in my opinion is the that TenCent has recently invested in quite a few long term projects thus taking them from a net credit to net debt position.For me as a long-term investor that is a good thing, but stock markets are increasingly short term in their thinking.",
"Likewise, I like the current price on TCEHY, but need info on tax implications.",
"I have never owned any of these Chinese ADRs but am interested in a couple, led by TCEHY.What are the tax implications for U.S. investors? Does it make a difference if they are held in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs vs. taxable accounts?Thanks,Mike",

He had a fantastic chart of mobile usage and population in China. Pay attn to what he says of Tencent mngmt. They actually own approx 30% of Tencent,
The trade war of course affects Tencent as it negatively affects the Chinese economy. The currency devaluation alone makes results in dollars much worse.,
"Recently began accumulating some- hadn't seen much written about it until 3x in the last week or so.  Walking back on trade war has already began this week- China could be next.I don't see Tencent doing anything less than great, given the population in China.

"I say the trade war provides a good entry opportunity . I don’t really think the trade war is gonna be as serious as the media makes it to be, and tencent will be a top performer in a long run",
This market seems to be turning bearish.  The price TCEHY might just be reflective of that.,
Would tend to agree. Main problem with this stock is two things 1. the trade war obviously is having an effect. 2. It trades via OTC pink sheets which scares many investors away. If it was a normally listed and traded stock it would fair much better.,
"Great long term buy at this price if you can buy and forget for 5years.Short term, the chart is still in decline. Maybe it will bounce at 40 RSI as you say. Just looking at price chart though it still looks ugly, in a solid down channel. Combined with HK market, trade wars (yes irrelevant to TC but it has an irrational impact), expense growth, slowing sales growth (due to size, not performance - still very robust), it's hard to predict what will spark the next sustained rally.It's a well run company with leadership in many areas, so with a 5 year horizon this is a great entry point if you can ignore short term noise.",

However anyone buying may get hit with the trade war, i know i bought just the day 200B$ tariff was annouced, got hit heavily after hours. The resolution to trade war, should it ever resolve, may not be favourable to Tencent. You know Visa and MC may eat away their payments business.

"Beware of IPO's...unless...you can get in on the offering. Surges like this never occurred until 1987! Why?1. 1987 was the beginning of the dotcom boom. A few IPO's even doubled on the first day of trading. That brought in day trader's, some who quit their jobs - most failed.2. Prior to 1987 in order for any respectable investment banker to allow a deal was to have positive earnings in three of the last five years. Then, all you had to have was 'an idea'3. The Crash of '87 (October) more or less brought an end to the high fliers. Not until the social media craze did it occur again. Note that Facebook, and especially Google FAILED in their IPO's plunging almost immediately =- damn! I should have bought Google in low teens! My wife won't let me forget that!4. It was Ayn Rand lover, Sir Alan of Greenspan who caused the problem in the wake of the collapse of Long Term Capital Mis-Management in late 1998. The Fed had been on the verge of tightening due to an overheating economy but this forced him to do the opposite. He never tightened again even after LTCM market risk proved short lasting.5. As if this wasn't enough, after a short study allowing the five largest NASDAQ stocks to be marginable, the Fed (stupidly and insanely) made ALL NASDAQ stocks marginable - FROM THE DATE OF THE IPO. This caused margin borrowing, which had been low to soar to records, carrying the stock market with it. Note that none of the big brokers would lend against the unseasoned NASDAQ stocks, but the ones servicing day traders did: that was their bread and butter!6. Y2k put a damper on the entire market BUT due to the advent of the Euro on 1/1/99, foreign money kept pouring into U.S. markets. Then in late Spring 0f 2000 it stopped causing stocks to unravel...even IBM broke $100 around mid-year, then in October, tech stocks plunged. Goldman's chief strategist, Abby Joseph Cohen, told everyone not to worry and hold on. Those who did were crushed. 7. The housing boom created the next wave, and when housing peaked (mid-2007, not 2008), they began bailing. Borrowing took off again along with the market in March 2009. This brings us to the present where margin borrowings remain at record highs ($660B June) and more than three times even the 2000 high. Obviously, it also contributed to the 2008 credit crisis (peaked at approx $425B when the market topped out in 2007 plunging to $200B.in 2008!!!  Early in 2016 the low was about $475B, beginning to surge the day after the election (uncertainty). It has steadily climbed at the steepest level on record to $660 billion in June! Bubblicious!!! Since 1999 there has been a direct correlation to margin borrowing and the broad market (S&P 500). These numbers are approximations for the full story, and it is troubling go to Ed Yardeni's website: www.yardeni.com/...Now you have the reasons why to not play IPO's unless you can get in on the offering, which few can. You have to be a prime client of a syndicate manager and there are strings attached (at least there were and I suspect they still hold true): first, not only can you not sell on the first day of trading, you have to hold it for at least 30 days and perhaps longer. That doesn't mean you can't sell but it does mean you will never get in another IPO from that firm - ever! Oh, and yes, if you sell during that period, your broker doesn't get paid - see the problem?Looking at the IPO's recently like Tenable (TENB), which was priced Thursday at $23 immediately shot up to $33.89 and immediately started to retrace all session until bottoming at $29.90 and finally closed at $30.25, not only did the price fall but volume dropped precipitously after the first few days of trading. Not a sign of a healthy market.  Oh, and one other point: none of the hot IPO's have positive earnings making the multiples absurd. Their product can be replicated (although not quickly), and that will detract from pricing power while sales growth as with the AVLR IPO is likely a stretch.On deck? OPRA...good luck to all! Me?

"Great topic this week!I mostly just use earnings season to monitor my holdings, but occasionally get to make some good trades around them.Last season was able to pick up HD at a great price after its post-earnings drop.This season picked up a Jan 2020 call in UNH after it dropped (but held up very well) post-earnings.This week avoided much of the carnage by simply not owning FB or NFLX (except via ETFs) - and had the good fortune to tactically sell INTC the previous week ;-)VERY pleased with the nice pop in AMD - and even better how well it has been holding up rather than dropping back !!!!I also find that I end up adjusting my portfolio towards the end of earnings season to account for developments.Hope you (Jeff) and Mrs OldProf are enjoying the vacation !!!!Cheers, Ian",

So many better choices for dividend stocks then just about any Biotech. As soon as Gild announced that it was paying a dividend it has done nothing but go do down. When ABVB raised its dividend in Jan it was trading over $115 now its under $90. The money would be better spent on an acquisition.,

Buybacks would be nice with that cash pile as well. New CEO whoever that is knows they must do something to move the stock price up and while waiting for their pipeline how about some buybacks. just a thought.,

Good example: TEVA... Doubled off the lows after their new CEO (a turnaround specialist) came in. Also got Buffet to buy in.",
"Would have been a quarter that, at least temporarily, would have pushed the stock into the 80's. Then came the CEO/Chair announcements.

"Disagree in your ""stabilization in sight"". Do a bit better on your research and numbers. Real growth for GILD/KITE throughout 2018 in store with Genvoya, Biktarvy, Discovey, yescarta and Truvada.seekingalpha.com/...Revenue for Q2 2018 was $5.65B - a beat of analysts's $440M. But, Q1 2018 revenues were $5.1B - so revenues beat by $560M. I think this trend continues because HCV will not fall further from $1B a quarter. $5.9B in Q3 2018 seems very likely IMO with EPS over $2.20.",
"I still look at a purchase of the stock for $77 to really be $24 for $24 in cash per share and then $53 for the operating company that should easily earn $6 per share (8-9x earnings) and growing slowly now too as HCV can't really go down much more and HIV and Yescarta grow. You're waiting for the $24 to be reinvested to return you more than bank rates! That should be pretty easy eventually. And those $6 earnings also include $4-5 billion per year in R&D. You don't spend that kind of money without discovering something! And the company has many irons in the fire here. The stock is still a VERY good value at $77, should be valued at least at 12-15x the $6 earnings plus the $24 cash reinvestment option.",

hi guys I was surprised to see chk drop today but actually quite happy as I believe the company is that much less risky and picked up more shares . I also got back into my swn . this reminds me of teck q4 2016 er . the street was looking for ~ minus thirty cents eps and they crushed it with 1 cent eps . the stock tanked on the news .

CHK has now delivered on its promise of a material asset sale with proceeds largely used to reduce debt.  I believe this accomplishes the 20% debt reduction target promised by management.  I suspect the recent drop in share price will get a nice uptick from this and Q2 earnings.,

Laughing at the recession call good luck but just for your information no1 can call a recession not even the best of the best at what they do in this space. No1 can call a recession but interesting...,
there is 0 doubt in my mind that this stock is cheap or cheaper than what the rest of the market is trading. it is one of the cheapest stocks around via my fundamental research. questions are how capital intensive is their business it is no software company. but i like how they are building communities. they do a good job especially in NJ . I am going long on TOL. the reason i really like the fundamentals of toll brothers is that the p/s is 0.85 and their profit margins right now are 9.50% and expecting to grow EPS next year over 10% and over 19.90% in the next 5 years. although EPS q/q is down -1.00% the Sales q/q is up 17.30%. with a small payout of just 9.50% and a yield of 1.25%. the price / free cash flow of 16.5 is not the best could be lower.  But the ability to generate 553.20m on a $5.34b price tag is not shabby compared to the rest of the market and growing. one last thing i have a weird feeling that real estate will always be pricey because the amount of land in good areas with good jobs will never increase it will always stay the same. but will the homebuilders ever run out of good land to build ? who knows at this point the only thing i trust is the numbers and you can’t even trust them sometimes... cheers cashcowi,

Escalation of the issue to upper manager does not seem to help either.  We have been living in east coast for 10+ years.

"Again the same trading pattern repeats. Selling pressure all week long, but on Friday it is absent.This is indicative of a short attack which has driven this thing into a deeply oversold position. Looking forward, the 24th after the close a position update on short interest will be published. At that time, in my opinion, we should see a substantial build of short interest. At some point this will have to be covered and a sharp reversal will take place. Martin, in the past, has seen some very significant reversals in similar situations.",
"Well, I will bet there is a significant amount of short selling taking place with an absence of buying due to the usual low level of buying you have at this time in the distribution cycle. We have to wait until next Friday to see if I am right about short selling driving the sell-down.

Also, it's likely that between the interest saving and the savings in required capex for the improvements in the pipeline, MMLP us saving far more than the forgone revenue from the WTLPG pipeline. Also, as noted on the call, the company will be redirecting its business model to become more refinery-centric, and the planned first drop to accomplish that new model is MRMC's trucking business, which is not merely a temporary Permian excess takeaway business that will evaporate as new Permian pipes are built; it is a fee based refinery-centric business.  This is currently under consideration and negotiation and conflict committees will ultimately have to deal with this. There will likely be other drops to follow in due course.   Elliot Miller",

It is false hope to expect the environmental issues are behind FCX simply because the govt is their partner.FCX is a ""no touch"" until the Grasberg ownership restructuring is transacted and the past environmental infractions are resolved.",

Good article.  Thanks for the insights.  I'm going to start following this stock for a bit.  I think both T and F will have lower entry points and we might see yields over 7% on both when it's all said and done.,
"AllStarTrader,Your article gives just the sunshine view, using selected figures that will give the rosiest outlook, but they are often not the figures that are commonly used.Every report, every analyst & all the earnings news use the expected eps as the number by which to compare & judge the actual reported eps  That is standard.For example, you should be comparing this Q2 eps to analysts' expectations.  Yes, you initially give this, but you fail to mention it again,  & immediately proceed to using the prior year's Q2 number.  Your use of this highest expected eps (by whom?), rather than Capital IQ Consensus number of 0.89,serves to bolster your statement---""Earnings came in quite a bit above expectations and more than the typical penny beat.""It is so obvious that you cherry-picked the exp. 0.85 figure, which is the lowest of any expected eps figure one can find, to bolster your statement I quoted above.  When, it would have been FAR more objective & accurate if you had written instead::""Earnings came in at 0.91 cents, which, depending on which eps estimate of several you use, range from a 2 penny beat, which is not very significant, to a 0.04 - 0.06 beat, which would be moderately above expectations.""Your intent is clear here - to choose the lowest exp. eps to support your ""significant beat"" narrative.  This only reflects back to you and puts your objectivity in question.Then, you quickly abandon any further mention of that beat, and move immediately on with an eye-catching graph, cut & pasted from T's Slides verbatim,  that uses the prior year's Q2. figure of 0.79, which then states next to it  ""Adjusted EPS of $0.91, a 15.2% increase.""  This is deceitful to jump to comparisons to a year ago.  This is but one example of the subterfuge, cherry-picked partial data, & the overall disingenuous Earning Report, which I had fully expected of a company that never presents the true reality, but a fluffed up, slanted narrative.Thus, those who quickly read your article will just see this, think it's all about the beat from LAST qtr, when it is not,, & think ""Oh, that is impressive.""Then, you present a Valuation Chart, and proceed to brag & misstate:""From a valuation perspective, we now see that we are getting the company at a cheaper P/E than even during the Great Recession. We also have an attractive P/S, P/B, and P/CF ratio.""The P/E argument isn't worth addressing other than to say, you are viewing a P/E that is lower due to a fall in stock price as desirable, which is the narrative all the bull-pumpers of T continuously rave about.  Who CARES about a lower P/E, when this stock was at a low enough P/E, and was growing until it crashed after reaching the 45's?You then brag about the FCF, when I see no full year figure given.  It that figures that are given are estimated full year figures, then 4.90 for 2018 is extremely poor, as 2016 was 6.86, & 2017 was 6.10 in 2017.  Falling each year -  Is that drop something to brag about?You fail to ever address the loss in value of the stock, which has fallen through a number of technical support levels. and should be of major significance in any analysis or discussion of this company's metrics.Your article is basically rehashed AT&T provided graphs & charts, and a thesis based almost solely on P/E and dividend, which I find meaningless and just a distraction from the ugly realities of the true condition of this company, which is beyond deplorable.In your conclusion, you even state as positive that the shares are trading near multi-year lows!  Unbelievable! ""With shares trading near multi-year lows, yielding a safe 6.5%, and a low multiple being present, AT&T provides for an attractive investment.""An attractive investment?  Only for those entering at these multi-year lows, and that is assuming it will not continue to fall, and assuming TWX merger will not be repealed, and assuming the humongous debt of this messed-up gargantuan conglomerate does not eat it alive.",

"I'm holding my shares but not adding.  This is not my grandma's ATT anymore;  these recent deals have shifted the risk profile substantially.Vertical acquisitions are the hardest to integrate.  A lot of risk that overzealous acquirers will chase away critical leaders of the acquired company, and end up going through a down cycle while they unnecessarily have to learn a new business.  Too early to tell if that is the case here, but I'm watching closely for strong indicators.  The debt load means that the integration of TWX needs to go pretty smoothly.  The DirecTV integration was a mess.  Watching to see if T mgmt learned from their mistakes or if they are just going to repeat them on a larger scale.",
"As a retiree even if the stock goes nowhere, I collect my 6%+....Going forward it's all about execution and I don't know if Randall is the guy....I would be careful about noting eps is what matters...look at Altria  and its declining sales....stock gets pummeled even though they exceed the estimate.......T needs to get the revenue side going to go along with good eps numbers and good cash flow so they can pay down the debt....but it really gets back to execution....",

Historically, UPS trades at 19-21 times forward earnings.  Most analysts will be upgrading this stock in the next 10 days.

"I think the sell of in GM shares has more to do with potential for additional tariffs, than the the revised earnings forecast. Both the auto manufacturers and shareholders are in limbo until resolution is reached with Europe, China and NAFTA.   If we back out this trade tariff situation, GM continues it's transformation into a much stronger company.  The totally new crossovers are high quality, well styled products, selling at much higher transaction prices. The new pickup is due out in several weeks, and they are totally all new, and GM has greatly increased crew cab production. Once we see a Global slowdown in Auto sales, I believe GM will show investors that they can still remain profitable, by having very current, higher margin models. At that point the shares should get the higher valuation they deserve.",

"As someone here already pointed out (reader sri28), Mark Zuckerberg, David Wehner and, probably, Sheryl Sandberg might resign because in my opinion, they’re not capable to manage such a big corporation. Especially regarding the communications to the market where Mr. Mark Zuckerberg (CEO) and Mr. David Wehner (CFO), in Wednesday’s Conference Call, have shown for the third time in a row a total lack of tact and diplomacy. (The CNBC link below shows how they do always the same mistake). www.cnbc.com/...In this life, the form of doing or saying something, is everything!!! And you usually have 3 ways to manage an identical issue.	1.	You can hide the issue	2.	You can brutally manage the issue 	3.	You can softly manage the issue. Hiding issues in the Top Finance World is NEVER a good idea because “the real truth” use to always emerge and your lies can lead you to bankruptcy or in prison (or both). So the best ethical behaviour for a Company Manager (CEO-CFO-CTO etcétera) is to always tell the truth to its investors and to the market but, what’s the best way to tell that truth?!? I have a small example here:Imagine that you are the owner of a very fancy and successful restaurant in your City.One night, while carrying your restaurant’s garbage bags outside, you notice in the external garbage bin, the presence of a plague of rats and/or cockroaches.. It is logical to suppose that those rats and cockroaches are not alone and that, probably, their “parents” have also infiltrated in the neighboring Pharmacy, Bakery, Butchery, the Kindergarten and the Supermarket..Here you have 2 ways to disclose the issue. 	1.	You can hysterically start screaming that only your restaurant is infested and that everything inside from the food to the chairs is now contaminated - which will obviously result in a clients stampede, the restaurant closure and in your own instant and painful bankruptcy...                                   -OR-	2.	You can tactfully and diplomatically alert all the neighborhood that, some rats and cockroaches have been spotted all around and that you, in your fancy and cool restaurant, already have taken all the proper counter measures to avoid any mice or bugs entering in it especially in the kitchen and in the food storing places. You might lose a very small amount of clients anyway but, nothing serious at all. When placed in front of a big problem, you’ve fully and honestly communicated the issue, you’ve not lied to anyone and you have been a good citizen alerting of the existing plague. And most important, while doing so, you have not ruined yourself and your own business in the process..Dear Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Wehner, as you can see and as I previously wrote, the form in which you communicate something to the Market (future possible and hypothetical bad news) can determine a cascade of events. In my opinion, in Wednesday’s Conference Call, you two (but especially Mr. Wehner) have once again and for the third time in a row - (see above CNBC link) - used the most brutal and less diplomatic way to communicate an issue (a possible - but not sure - growth slowing in next Q’s). An “issue” that, on the other side, also affect many other big and mature tech Companies including GOOG, NFLX, AAPL or AMZN.That brutality in communication’s PR led us to the present horrible days. Horrible for you, your company and, especially horrible for us, the small investors. Dear Mark & David,This is truly not the right way to manage a Company if you really love and appreciate your Company and your investors. You’ll never forget that behind any Facebook small investor there’s always a man or a woman who may have a Family, kids, a job, a dog or a cat, household expenses, a mortgage and even some dreams which he/she try to materialise working hard and (also) investing some hard earned money in your Company.Best Regards,David S.

"And to add some perspective about how overdone the sell-off is (was).  Amazon reported net profits of $2.5 billion and the stock jumped 3% in after-hours trading.  Facebook earned $5.1 billion with much much higher operating margins, and more to come.  This was the first quarter that endured the Cambridge Analytica fallout, and they missed by basis points on the DAU and MAU, which were basically rounding errors.We want to panic that FANG has had too much in gains....but the two that truly earn their growth multiples in constant cold hard cash are FB and GOOG(L).  I think FB was a little ahead of itself when it broke through 210.  But at 176 ??  Well, I'm not ""backing up the truck"" because I'm a disciplined investor so 10% is my max, which I filled today.

YouTube is competing, AT&T probably will, but there's a lot of ad revenue floating around looking for a home. If not FB, GOOG, or T - who will be benefitting from it?

Mark should give way to a new CEO to take it from here. He is unable to manage the big corporation. He needs a professional. Growth till here was exponential due to the name and very less competition. From this level it should be a seasoned professional. Mark has to step aside a little and watch his fortunes grow rather than show his long and distressed face and make all the investors angry. The way he handled the grilling by Congress was also not very mature. This is his company and he has 60% voting power but it is not that small now. Lots of institutional and individual investors fortunes are tied to the stock so it is better to have someone who can take this cash cow forward to $500,

"I remember my thinking at the time I purchased NSC. On cost to move merchandise one mile, trains fuel costs are much lower than trucks. I believe that is true today. Now, with the shortage of long haul truck drivers, the equation slants even more toward trains.",
Now is not the time to buy NSC because intermodal growth will slow down as a result of rising prices from imports as a result of Trump's stupid trade war  that he started; also fuel prices will keep rising because Trump got out of the Iran deal which resulted in soaring  fuel cost. Trump did good with tax cuts and cutting regulations which helped create a 4% growth in GDP but then wrecked everything with his stupid tariffs.  Overall economic growth will not be elevated like the author hopes but a big recession down the line unless Congress intervenes and stops all this foolishness.,

"The author has done a terrific job. BUD is still expensive, after the recent pullback, but the group has always been expensive in term of valuation. The management has delivered good results in the past, and with the best-in-class assets, they will continue their great work.",
"“Anheuser-Busch InBev Is A Great Company At A Fair Price” & “great long-term buy”Could not agree more.""The Net Debt/EBITDA ratio fell from 4.7 in 2008 to 2.5 in 2011. It only took it three years.""The company deleveraged so quickly because it had slashed its dividend from €0.54 in 2008 to €0.21 in 2009. The quicker the company deleveraged, the quicker it was able to increase its dividend again. This time, however, it has not slashed its dividend but kept it constant, at €3.6. Deleveraging will thus take a lot more time.I’ve played around with the numbers as well. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts here.Based on the following assumptions, which I think are reasonable, BUD should be at its ideal leverage again by 2025-2026:-	Annual EBITDA growth of 6%-	Annual FCF growth of 5%-	Dividend growth of 3% from 2018 to 2020 and 6% from 2021-	€/S of 1.2Some other things, as this article seems to have been published after but written before publication of the H1 results, to which the share price reacted negatively, largely because of disappointing volumes in North-America:- The Q2 volumes for North-America were largely an anomaly. Or as Brito explained it during the conference call: “there was a technical delay, I would call it a technical delay in shipments in the U.S. given that as you said, the STRs or the numbers in the marketplace in terms of sell-out are much better than the STWs.” (due to the very tight freight market in the U.S.) Followed by: “the important thing here is our guidance that STRs and STWs will converge for the full-year [...] and therefore we will catch-up strongly in the second half.” So the US volumes should improve considerably in H2. - On the US craft business that everyone seems to be worrying about, but that is actually not a big deal at all: “Our craft business in the U.S. is much bigger and much more diversified than in other countries. We have 12 craft partners. Our craft business is doing very well going well ahead of the segment, growing double digits in a segment that this quarter was flat, craft segment, so we are doing very well.” - On net debt: it increased to $109B from $104.7B end of 2017, due to seasonality of cash flows, working capital investments and timing of tax and dividend payments. An increase in net debt during H1 is very common for BUD, as well as for other companies. This does not worry me at all. Net debt should be sitting around $100B at the end of this year. Oh and lastly, notice the strong comeback of Brazil. Underlying volume growth over there is even stronger than reported, as the truckers strike took 3 percentage points of their volume growth in Q2.So really, the future is looking bright for BUD. I will be adding to my long position in the following weeks. Given that growth will accelerate in H2 and volumes should improve, I think the time to buy is now.",

"I like EGLE also, but have no position for the moment.(sold out at higher prices)Management does a great thing : - they started to renew the fleet towards the Ultramax segment at the bottom of the cycle. There is still some work to be done. A couple of smaller vessels will be sold, once the market takes a pauze.- They outperform the index in a consistant way.- the $ 200 million credit facility at 8.25% was a good move (given rising LIBOR rates)However there are a couple of minpoints :- the fleet still has a too many smaller supramax vessels. (therefore OPEX is too high wrt. peers)- with respect to the supply of new ships this & next year : globally the supply will indeed be limited, but will be much higher in the ultramax niche (% wise) than the overall 0.8% mentionned. According to Affinity the orderbook stood at 30% of the fleet.Against this stands the fact that the Ultramax segment will steal cargo from the smaller panamax segment, especially in late 2019 & 2020 when the low sulphur fuel consumption comes into the picture.Allied shipping Inc. :Ultramax VS Old Panamax relation The design of Ultramax bulker resembles the one of the older Panamax (64-69k Dwt), which was being built during 80’s90’s. However, there are main differences between them, pointed out as follows: • The Ultramaxes are geared in contrast to the majority of the gearless Old Panamaxes. • The length overall (LOA) of the Ultramaxes is 199 mtrs, shorter than the 225mtrs of the Old Panamaxes. • The Ultramax design is characterized by low fuel oil consumption.Advantages• High fuel prices along with strict pollution regulations, enforced the building of fuel efficient vessels, achieving the goal of 25,75t per day 14,25 knts. New propeller design, more efficient hull form and the Eco type main engine are the main factors that contributed to such an achievement. • Ultramax vessel has been designed ideally for Asian trade, as China and India constitute the major importers affecting global market, where the gears and grabs are required at most of the ports. Ultramax’s LOA is 199 mtrs, which is 10 mtrs longer than the one of Supramax and 25 mtrs shorter than same of Panamax. Hence, every port that can host a Panamax can easily host an Ultramax. Similarly, an Ultramax vessel can load or discharge almost in every port where a Supramax does. Same advantages fortify the Ultramax vessel suitable for African ports as well. Bearing in mind that Africa is a major importer of bagged cement and rice, gears and grabs are mandatory for the discharging operation of such cargoes. • Moreover, an Ultramax can compete with a Panamax in the lots of 60-70k ± 10%, considering that the chartering of an Ultramax saves the costs of a floating crane (region $1,50/mt), which is inevitable for the gearless Panamaxes. • The operation of an Ultramax vessel in the Spot market highlights the comparative advantages over a Supramax, as low fuel consumption along with increased cargo capacity results in optimum cost efficiency.",

"Although I tend to ""believe"" in the FB story I sold my position a few days ago because I tend to avoid having a sizable position into an earnings report. It's obvious that buying ahead of a report is dangerous as the outcome tends to be asymmetric: stocks tend to go down more and faster when there is a negative surprise. The tax situation complicates things of course and serves as a handy excuse for taking the risk. But it can be avoided via buying of put options. After two deceptions this year my trust has considerably suffered and I'm probably not alone. FB stock will build up a risk premium and trade at a lower valuation (P/E) for a while.

"Market exaggeration. Fb’s in the same dilemma that McDonald’s was in when Supersize Me upended the fast food biz. Yes, the regulation landscape is changing, but as leader of the social networking revolution Fb is on the front line atm. Google has nearly 10x more user data than Fb, but G+ was a dud and the two aren’t even in the same league in terms of political influence. I repeat: Instagram is Fb’s saving grace. Ig stories are de-stigmatized and I predict they’ll topple Snap. We’ve yet to see Fb unleash Instagram’s full potential as an e-commerce business. As for fake news, Fb doesn’t need to cater to the right—that’s what Instagram is for. The politically fueled younger demographic can vent on the Fb app while Instagram strategically remains neutral. Consider the big # of users who use both! Fears of Fb crowding out conservative audiences are irrelevant. Rather, Fb needs to focus on user engagement and decluttering the Fb app (two v realistic fixes) to ease fears of saturation. Watch as Instagram shopping upends Poshmark. PR can be fixed: Fb Messenger’s once-laughable ratings have soared the last couple years. Fb won’t make you $ the next few weeks, but there’s a bright future ahead.",
Weak guidance may have had much to do with it.,
I just sold some December puts with a strike of 160. It may be a nice trade or it may be a nice entry price for this colossus.,
"Plowner I'm thinking it will not go that low but as we see .. "" You never know "" .",
The magic number for me is $165 when and if it gets there I would start a position with a stop around $150.,
I believe in FB future... I currently have no shares. I’m just wondering how long it can goes...  What price I should buy at ?    Would you think the stock can go as low as 160$ within a week or so ?  I guess it is the unanswered question...,
Even today 74 % of. FB is owned by institutional investors .,
FCF CAGR since 2013 was 52%. Price CAGR during same period was „only“ around 28%. Hence it looks to me like a rather sooner than later deccelertion of revenue and FCF was priced in ever since. Seems like the market is making an incorrect forecast here rather than correcting a previous incorrect one.,

Facebook is convenient for video calls to friends and family. But I no longer have their app installed. What I do say and go in daily life is none of their business. No more turning on my microphone listining to me either.,

Waste of time - all this here. These times are no different from times some of us have seen before. PEs flying over 35 have never lasted too long. They wont last this time either.This small down with FB today is very small when you look at 2-3 year period. Get over it. There will be lots of this downhill in coming years.,

"Everyone back into the pool.  You had to know that the bigs boys were not going to let the average joe make money on this.  They wiped it out in one night.  Facebook was too frothy and the market fixed it.  Despite this,  this stock is the place to be for high flying tech.  It crashed after camberidge and came back.  This is no different.",

"Finally... lots of negative end of the world sentiment... Managemnt basically cleared house of all the negative things they could think of... didn’t even talk about possible new monetization methods like entering into Payments, maybe buying Yelp, or starting a reviewing section.. just started going to dating and selling movie tix online... lots of option value of potential future initiatives. 30%+ growth, 30%+ operations margins.... all for PE in the teens... not bad.",
"Still a decent price longer term. Shorter term, a better entry could be possible. Since I’m already overweight, I’ll wait before adding in case it goes lower in the coming months",
I am done with Facebook.,
"""Lastly, Instagram continues to grow rapidly, particularly in monetizing itself, and could soon itself be a major pillar of what holds Facebook's growth up.""- Facebook should just spin off Instagram as a separate company. The market will never recognize Instagram's true value as long as it's bundled with Facebook. The spotlight will always be on Facebook's woes- think ESPN and Disney.",

Competition cannot follow this.Europe is looking forward to get this car, current real replacements for ICE's are too expensive for most people.Still i3 and Leaf are no competition and the I-Pace is the same price tag as MS+MX (anyway sold out for this year).I'd see the current balance sheet rather through Amazon glasses.We're in a phase of enormous growth, no chance to make profit now.But with Sandy M's analysis in mind that the M3 will have a 30% marginwe're heading for a happy LONG future.So hopefully the popcorn doesn't get stuck in your throat...",

"Here’s a thought. Tesla has been saying that as soon as they start volume production, the profits would come. The expectation for this quarter is that sales are going to be almost twice last quarter’s sales. And the negative EPS are going to be almost twice what they were. So... the more cars Tesla sells, the more they lose. If they double sales again, losses will be $5 a share! How long can this dumpster fire keep burning?",

This is after the company has recorded bigger & bigger losses every one of the last 5,qtrs. He has debt that will come due this year if the stock price is a certain levels.  Oh & by the way - the whole way he was going to change the world was to sell a $35k model that was eligible for a $7,500 credit.  Make it affordable for the masses.  He took deposits and now says it may not be until 2020 for the cheaper model.  He said Tesla would go out of business if it lived up to Elon s promise.  Not profitable, until he tweaks some things.  Bait & switch -$55k-$78k will be available problem is no more rebates after this year (wasted them on the more expensive Teslas).  After 200,000 sales which they hit this year. Credit fades away. He thought that if he ran around with his hair on fire and put out 5000 3's the last week of June he'd be ok.  He was taunting the shorts, being rude to the analysts & creating an intolerable work of environment.  He assumed that the 5000 news was going to crush the shorts, keep the debt from coming due cause stock price will soar  & magically make his company profitable. The opposite happened & the real EM is here.  News for all you shareholders : you don't own the company -the real owners are the $10B debt holders.",

"Well, vacationing in FL with family, I'll sit pool side with umbrella in drink and maybe buy a few more RDCM and keep dreaming of the next deal that will come someday?!?!? It would be nice for a major breakout while on vacation, somehow it just feels even better to make money while you just sit around doing nothing and listening to margaritaville song. 🍸🍹cheers!",

TY Mike,
"I forgot to mention. I'll take the other side of that algo discussion that you and Cowboy were having on that other board.I'm not sure of the MM involvement behind the scenes but methinks they are used in illiquid stocks as they are in liquid ones but it's easier for them to play the stocks.No hard evidence, just from observing.Peace.",
Thanks Mike.FYI SILC reported a solid Q this AM with solid guidance.They expect a 2nd telecom win before year end. I'm not sure if this is T or another one but much like we've seen in RDCM's case these telcos don't move as fast as they could. SILC's CEO thought they would have had this next one sooner but sounds very confident about having it before year end 2018.I think we are setting up for multiple here before year end just as you do.Good luck and Peace.,
Thanks Mike. Long RDCM. Ready for this to thing to echelon up.,
LIKE; Long RDCM!,
