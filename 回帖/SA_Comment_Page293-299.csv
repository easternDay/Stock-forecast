Do you have any more detail for us, about front haul or other type of spending that you can identify as are, you know, let's say purely 5G related?  And then I have a follow-up.  Thanks.A - Stephen Alexander: Yes, Stanley, Steve Alexander.  If you saw the world coming out of mobile world Congress.  We said for a while, it would show up in three places, cell phones get faster, point to point microwave shows up and over long term, it will be kind of the infrastructure for the Internet of Things.So we view it as a very long-term driver of, you know, capacity background to the networks.  There's certainly going to be, you know, early trials and deployments, kind of point of view spot use of higher capacity.  We view it as the edge of the network was at 1 gig, and if it was at 10 gig, it will go to 100 gig.  And that will take, many, many, quarters if not years to get wide scale deployment.",

George KesariosTY,
In addition to the 5G trend there are competitive strength and initiatives taken by CRNT it selves1. Gaining market share - 10 new customers in 2017 and as they say - they have just begun2. enhanced go to market strategy - 2 new relation ship -to be informed soon - is CISCO one of them?3.

"I think the margin expectations are reasonable.  I expect they might be a bit lower than that in Q1 but could scale up in the following quarters.  The tuck-in number also sounds reasonable.  I think the issue is the balance sheet and how they will be financed.  Given they don't have a revolver, I think they need the $3 million in cash just to manage the flows of the business.  They also had around $16 million of total debt as of 9/30.The acquisition story would be more interesting if they had a better balance sheet - i.e. more cash.  I think debt financing isn't easy to obtain when you have an ""Emphasis of Matter"" note on the financials from the Auditors due to being CF negative, but perhaps they can borrow against current assets.  It is true that A/R is now more reasonable and largely current (withing 30 days) so hopefully that is squared away.  Generally, I think your assumptions are reasonable.",

"I think for the first Audit in FY16, your thesis would make sense.  i.e. the write-down to $19 million.  They overpaid and there were competitive bidding changes that would indicate a write-down was appropriate (particularly with the high discount rates).  The FY17 writedown from >$19 million to $7.4 million is more challenging for your thesis to explain.  It implies something significant happened during FY17 to cause this, given valuation methodology by the auditors didn't change y/y.  Most of the reimbursement changes happened on Jan 1/16  so that shouldn't have impacted FY17 differently.  That is an outstanding question.  This is especially interesting given the auditors still valued Legacy Oxygen at $6 million in recent audit, despite the fact that its revenues are only in the $5 million level annually vs PAI believed to be $20mm+.A further element is the fact that they altered the revenue recognition policy in Q1/17, lowering quarterly revenues by $3-4 million -- all on the PHM side.  This was mentioned in the Jan 24/17 PR.  We don't know what divisions this occurred in but it was all on the New PHM side of the business.  This can be seen by the fall-off in revenues on the non-Viemed side from Q4/16 to Q1/17 ($22.5 million to $18.5 million) offset by a $2 million bump at Viemed q/q that masked it somewhat.  This was all due to rev. recognition changes as product culling and Logimedix windown had been done for at least 2 to 3 quarters by that point.  I did confirm this overstating of revenue practice with the former CFO but did not learn of the specific unit(s) involved.  I believe the overstatement of revenues and thus receivables is also why they had such a big bad debt issue.",
"The Patient Aids deal definitely requires more investigation given the composition of the board and management.  By my math, PA  is valued at just $4.8 million by the Auditors after backing out the $2.6 million paid for the Pro2 tuck-in from April/16 that was folded into that division (total Auditor value at $7.4 million). About $27 million of writedowns in two Audits.  That $4.8 million is very low for a company that claimed to have $17-$20 million of revenues at time of acquisition.",
Junk,
Please review your assumptions after considering the following:PHM can do tuck-in acquistions for  < 1/2x revenue due to lower ebitda margins on targets as a result of large Medicare cuts in 2016.    http://mwne.ws/2BvNGSrPHM says it can acquire targets with ebitda margins between 5% and 10% and “significantly” improve those margins post-acquisition.   http://mwne.ws/2C21hlF,

"Lots of promotional claims from Musk on A.D., but as we've seen, some of his promises materialize while others are pushed off into the future (just like AMD's forward promises, by the way).A limited-condition drive scenario is just one step along the way. I don't think most people realize how far behind Nvidia's technology and platforms AMD, Intel, and Tesla are in this space.I'm not saying they'll never get there. But will they get there nearly as soon as the big automakers that are already partnered with Nvidia? Hard for me to see how they could leapfrog over Nvidia's lead. What I strongly suspect is that we'll see the actual, safe, marketable, deliverable A.D. level ""x"" cars from some of Nvidia's partners well before the actual, safe, marketable, deliverable A.D. level ""x"" cars from Tesla. And that will cost Musk a great deal, both in sales and prestige.",

"It seems this article is actually about the viability of cryptocurrency. Its predictive value hinges on the fate of that industry.

But now with reverse effect some of those mining cards going to hit back to the market.So to sum it up, AI business is what attracts me, but there will be two hits that I can think about, 1. declining sales due to fewer demand on mining and 2. declining sales on desktop(gaming/multime...

"I'm sorry to say that as a writer you have to be able to make your point and your argument easier to put it in perspective. The smarter a person is the easier it is to understand them. Example,It is my belief that while some people may have invested in Nvidia due to the recent awareness of cryptocurrency and that the Company's chips are used for that purpose. But it is this writer's opinion that if that came to a halt, the race to conquer Artificial intelligence since China started pouring Billions of dollars into it for Military applications, Nvidia's CEO has had this vision since 2005. Therefore any loss sustained from the lack of cryptocurrency purchases will be more than offset by Nvidia's forge into Artificial Intelligence as whose goal is to crack any type of decoding will be achieved in microseconds! I could go on about the networking between Tanks, Aircraft, Soldiers, Navy vessels and Coast Guard so the battlefield is won before it's even begun!",
NVDA will do well because their chips are used in autonomous driving.,
"I have no view on AMD or NVDA or their current valuation levels.  Clearly they have some sort of sensitivity to the crypto mining space.  I did want to point out some concepts that may be missing from the analysis:1) Ethereum is switching from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in the near future (12-18 months).  When that switch over happens, GPU mining will be rendered useless for Ethereum- and it's not very efficient (relative to ASICs) for Bitcoin.  And in terms of alt-coins, there's not (currently) nearly enough market cap in them to soak up the excess GPU mining capacity currently being used by Ethereum.  In short, unless a new GPU-mining based coin gains significant market cap, there will be way too much GPU mining capacity in the market in the not so distant future (assuming proof of stake happens, which is a pretty high likelihood).2) While high GPU prices my be discouraging some gamers from upgrading, it is also encouraging savvy gamers to upgrade sooner.  The projected ROI on the hardware is positive (which is why people are willing to pay above MSRP for them), and the cash yield (ignoring initial outlay) is positive.  A gamer can buy a new card at MSRP, or even at a premium, and use the card at home to mine Ethereum as part of a mining pool (when they aren't gaming), and slowly ""earn back the cost of the card"".  Over a year, they will likely pay back half or more of the cost of the card.3) After 18-36 months (it varies based on a lot of assumptions), a GPU's marginal mining contribution becomes less than the electricity cost to run it, so it no longer is valuable to use for mining.  However, it does/will still have value on the secondary market for budget gamers.  Miners that are purchasing thousands of cards today, will be flooding the market with second hand, second-gen cards a year (or two) from now.4) People aren't hoarding/speculating on the value of GPUs increasing.  They're buying them and using them.  It's silly to have a productive asset sitting in a box depreciating.5) ASPs for NVDA/AMD have to be up significantly versus the non-crypto baseline.  This is due to the fact that the retailers are capturing full MSRP, meaning the manufacturers don't have to offer wholesale price reductions or retail-rebates to keep moving through aging product lines.  These ASP's being higher are hugely positive to gross margin, and subsequently net margin, ebitda and net income.  The impact of margin is likely more important than the impact on card volumes- I'm skeptical that they changed production volumes by that much in Q3/Q4 in response to the surge in demand.",

"Thanks for the article. Your attempt to quantify your thesis with actual cost numbers is commendable.One flaw in your analysis is the assumption that hash rate per card is constant, when in fact it has changed significantly. The change has been particularly large in Zcash due to competition between mining software authors. Current leading mining software has a hash rate ~5 times as high as software available in the first week after the launch of ZEC (using the same card), so the early growth of ZEC hash rate greatly overstates the added GPU capacity.I agree with you and Akram's Razor that mining is a much larger contributor to GPU sales than AMD and Nvidia admit, but this boom may have legs for longer than you might expect. I've seen weekly predictions of the end of profitable mining in Ethereum forums for years, but that didn't stop the current boom from happening. There is plenty of dumb money waiting to build more mining rigs.",

During the gold rush. it's the people who sold picks and shovels that made the money in the end.  Now that GPU prices have peaked it will definitely start adding some headwinds to NVDA and AMD sales when retail price and manufacturers prices come back together, the question is how much.  I haven't seen any good stats on gpu hoarding, so your guess is as good as mine.",

Tesla has to do several things however to access this market.1) Tesla has to actually produce those cars, and not a 1,000 units a week, more like 2,000 units a day (half a million units a year / 250 production days per year)2) Tesla needs to get autonomy working so that owners can put their cars to use as taxis when they don't need them. This matters because the target customers (many of them) will not be otherwise able to afford the Model 3 car they want... and that Tesla would like them to buy.3) Tesla needs to stand up distribution, service and financial support for such high delivery rates.IF Tesla manages ALL of these things, the company and the shareholders will come out alright. On the other hand, if Tesla continues to stumble and slip delivery dates, this situation will begin to unravel. There are a lot of Tesla customers standing in line and their patience will not last for ever. We are perhaps two years away from seeing other electric cars on the market that will be attractive to these potential Tesla customers. If Tesla has not sold cars to these folks by then, they are likely to walk away. And that would not be good news for Tesla or Tesla shareholders.",

"I recently almost purchased a VW Atlas, but decided instead to buy a Honda Pilot.  The Atlas is a beautiful car with many similarities to the Audi Q series, with lots of space and nicely laid out ergonomics.  I understand that VM made this car expressly for the US market where these larger SUVs selling in the $40K plus range are a large market.  FYI the car is sold with a 5 or 6 year 72,000 mile waranty.  One of the advantages of this kind of car, which are hugely popular in Chicago, is that you are sitting up a bit higher from the road and can get a better view of the surrounding traffic.  As a side comment, almost all the people that I know who own a Tesla (and all love the car) have this as a second car and use it for local travel, and have the financial means to do this.  This is a highly limited market that Tesla has been selling into.  $45K for a Model 3 sedan will appeal to the silicon valley folks with a high income but don't know if this will appeal to a wide customer base.",
"I would just remind everyone that the Volkswagen group includes: SEAT on the Iberian Peninsula, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Ducati, Skoda, they have a commercial truck division which under the brand names of Scania (in Scandinavia, duh), MAN, and Volkswagen, are doing joint ventures with China (FAW - Volkswagen and SAIC - Volkswagen), and have a total of 100 production facilities in 27 countries. They pulled ahead of Toyota last year as the largest Vehicle company in the world.  Despite their gaff with the diesel emissions fiasco they are diversified enough to remain competitive and should not be underestimated.  One of their marketing problems is that they have not offered all wheel drive across their Volkswagen product line, north of the Mason Dixon line (which Subaru figured out a long time ago) despite having done so in their home market.",

I know a lot of people were or are excited about an electric car that has some gadgets but the bottom line is that a car is a car and a means for transportation. Thereby the car price and the usability of the car (i.e. room, being able to drive long distance without bigger car charging related breaks, AWD etc.) still matter for the most people. With the issue that Tesla is delayed with the Tesla 3 entry version and the starting competition in that entry level I strongly believe Tesla sooner or later will hit a wall and will lose its cache with the resulting impacts on its business and going concern viability.",

Exactly. VW has it down and By the time Tesla does get it down everyone will be buying vw EVs. For cheaper and better quality.The market isn’t ready for EV. That’s why these other auto companies aren’t sweating like Tesla is.But Tesla longs will never admit defeat until bankruptcy? To much money to lose here.,
Not really fair to compare a car manufacturing company to a stock promotion company that turns out a few vehicles as a by-product.,
"I wont buy VW again , they scam with enviourment & pollute it ..",
You make some good points about how manufacturers at radically different stages of their growth/maturity can have radically different results in production and sales of radically different vehicles.,
"This comparison doesn't make sense to me. Yes, the Atlas outsold more expensive, higher performance vehicles from Tesla. It also outsold the Infiniti QX60, the MB GLE, the Buick Enclave, the Acura RDX, and is gaining ground on the BMW X5 and the Cadillac XT5.What's the takeaway here, that the Atlas' success is indicative of Tesla's failure? Or that when a decades old, mass marketed brand with a loyal customer base introduces a large, relatively inexpensive vehicle in an insanely popular segment that plugs an obvious hole in their lineup, the public might respond to it?I know it helps your clickbait take rate to say so, but not everyone else's success is Tesla's loss.",

It's getting harder to hold on as it's now a sizable piece of my savings and at some point I need to diversify but I am convinced that AMZN is a different animal and will be a permanent holding till they start to pay a dividend.

Those LP's can then sell the shares without reporting.Also a 3.8M share block traded around noon.. According to their latest public data, there are only 6 holders that have more than 3.8M shares.... Salzberg, Bessemer Ventures, Fidelity, Ilia, First Round, or Stripes.I'm not positive on the dark pool mechanics, but I'm pretty sure to have a single print that large you need a single seller (or buyer), to be transacting, which basically means the order has to be one of them.This transaction will likely get reported in the next few days via a form 4 and further spook the market...

Just wanted to thank you on an unbelievable article Doc.Apple is my #1 holding and you make me want to buy more.,
"I’m not sure what causes AAPL to be revalued, but I suspect that the real advantage of owning it is that we will eventually have a downturn in the economy and the market. Investors will be looking for safety, modest growth, and some income. Apple will look nice in a risky environment.AR will be a nice inducement to own an Apple product if it turns out to be more than a geewiz thing. Once we get to using AR for shopping ease of use will show Apple’s strength.Wearables of many kinds are on the way and Apple has quietly been expanding the portfolio. Don’t forget health which is a huge and profitable market where lead time, system integration, and regulation are keys.I am still overweighted in AAPL, but will draw down my position as I raise cash in this market. However, I consider AAPL ago be among my safest investments. If it were priced like other entrenched consumer product companies, it would be much higher. There is still denial about the stability of the Apple’s margins, but they keep bringing in the cash.",
"It is good for AAPL to be considered a mature company. If that is truly what the market thinks, we can expect the company's stock to be devoid of fluctuations. And its stock be valued on its revenue, profits and dividends rather than speculation of new products.Based on maturity, the company's stock should be at a forward PE of 15 to 18 plus its forward dividend yield which is at approx. 1.5%. So the stock should be at no less than approx. 17.5% forward PE or reasonably at forward PE of 19.5%. Leaving its stock to rise another 4.5% to 6.5% without being considered over-valued for a mature company. Keep in mind that I have  not considered its huge cash loads, which I would have hoped that the company had used to buy its shares and held them in the foreign companies where the cash was. Its stock holding would have been 4 to 6 times its cash holdings if that was done.",

"Like Tesla, AAPL is like religion. You either believe in it or you don't. AAPL is very innovative. The question is whether AR will be a game changer and I have no idea. The watch and other innovations were very nice but not game changers. In fairness to AAPL, when you so big and so profitable, it takes a lot to move the needle further. The service revenue is great but it usually backs into the I Phone so it is part of that product's success. It requires tremendous innovation just to maintain market share at premium pricing. Think about it. How good do you have to be just to keep people paying $1000 for a phone?The market so far doesn't buy a high growth story at a below 18 PE ratio. We have no idea to what extent AR will impact growth. I am long because I can envision decent growth without a blockbuster innovation. If it happens along, what a nice surprise.",
"While I believe APPL has upside, AR enabling technologies of much smaller companies seem to represent even more opportunity for dramatic growth and value creation.  Take for instance Universal Display (OLED) which has seen dramatic stock appreciation (albeit retreated a bit recently due to IPhone X shortfalls).  Even if Apple or Google double their market cap, companies like OLED could see 10X expansion. Thus, Apple in my mind is a conservative part of my portfolio while I am banking on other smaller cap businesses to drive the majority of growth.",

"As always, you write your thoughts so crisply and clearly that you make difficult to grab concepts entirely ""grab-able"". My difficulties with your thoughts and bullishness about Apple's prospects in this area are entirely about how do the millions of iPhone users actually put this application to work in their daily lives, and how does it become a must have function within the iPhone ? Almost every time I read and think about AR (and also VR), I come away ""stuck"" with the following applications:- in certain education environments such as history, biology, and perhaps engineering;- in gaming platforms, where gamers play e-games in AR/VR environments;-  in medical or surgery training, where AR/VR could enhance both training as well as actual surgical procedures.But I always ""see"" the need for a bulky standalone device, worn over the eyes and ears, which would seem to limit the application of the device as a restricted ""expert"" user as well as limited in terms of its TAM. For now, until the AR ""vision"" become more ""real"", it seems tempting to just stay with the blended profile of having AAPL with a healthy dose of its component suppliers, the likes of which include MU, Samsung, Intel, Cirrus and Broadcom!Still, it made for a very interesting read.....",

"I look at AR as just another potential profit center for AAPL and GOOGL.  My main reason for investing in both (and T, VZ, and TU) is the coming 5G revolution.  Yeah, I'm calling 5G a revolution.  Think that cord cutting is getting traction?  Wait until 5G allows people to download or stream movies with no glitches.  Why will I need my ISP?  Because after 20 years of being a customer they tried to charge me double what new customers pay?  I have to call ever year when they jack my rate up.  This year it went from $172 in November to $248 in January!  I argued it back down to $162, but I digress.So, AR, VR, and all of the other services that are currently offered make both AAPL and GOOGL long term buys IMO.  Both companies should be considered consumer staples.  Forget investing in CL, KHC, or SJM (all of which I sold recently), cell phones are much more addictive.  AAPL is our largest holding, and GOOGL is fourth.  I added to both recently when the market decided to put them on sale.Thanks for another great read, DoctoRx.  GLTU!",

"APPLE IN 5 YEARSI have always admired Apple’s approach to Technology, Creativity and the company’s long term goal’s and ethos.I bough shares in Apple just before the launch of the first iPad when shares were at $200, before the 7 to 1 split at just over $700 . Between $200 and $700, investors were consistently bombarded by analysts, constructing arguments for Apple’s failure at each new product launch and that Apple was doomed. By far the majority of analysts were doubting Thomases. Many employing pseudo scientific charts and theories argued vociferously that, Apple could not continue to grow. With the exception Brian White and a small number of others, this huge majority of doubters stated that Apple could not reach $1000 (pre split figure). Without the seven to one split Apple would now stand at $1,169 the existing split price being $167. It took approximately 6 years to go from $200 to exceeding $100 dollars.At $167 now, I sense, we are in a similar position to the position just before Apple’s creation of the iPad. The price of Apple’s shares/stock are exceptionally cheap. Other stock: Amazon and Google are ridiculously high. You will not regret buying Apple shares at this existing price and holding. Warren Buffit knows this as others do, who do their own thorough research.Apple has just created the  largest amount of money for any company ever in history. Apple has a war chest larger than some major nations. Apple has multifarious proven categories for future growth, including augmented reality spearheaded by the iPhone X and we know that it has others in development, including transportation, which will take many forms, including automated car share in cities. This category is worth $trillions, world wide, in the next decade. It also has international expertise in many areas and has the funds to make further strategic acquisitions.India is a huge future market and, with respect, is the New China for Apple. As Timothy Cook stated, Apple in India is in its  infancy and still has much work still to do, however, Apple is diplomatically and strategically building on the good work it has already done. Bit by bit (excuse the pun) Apple will grow enormously in India for sure. I remember the Analysts and Apple’s many critics, after Apple created the iPad at $200 to $400 (pre split), arguing vociferously that China would never accept Apple nor would it tolerate the cost of Apple products.The critics and Analysts have been consistently wrong about Apple’s trajectory over the last seven years and indeed from Apple’s inception. Even the first iPhone received very negative media coverage.If you do not buy Apple stock at this price now and hold, you will be sorely sorry in 5 years  when Apple is $400 to $500.",
"AAPL is a company that attracts more than its fair share of hate and animosity from the tech community and users over mostly inconsequential issues like a software change that has slowed down my iPhone 6...imperceptibly.  And then there is the repeated nonsense that AAPL has lost its innovation bones, wholly refuted by new products since Cook took over.  And, when a new product like the watch or the Air Pods or Apple Music is brought to market, the loud naysayers are heard making short shrift of the products.  The fact is that AAPL is highly innovative, slower to market in an effort to bring high quality and reliable products to users and that all of AAPL's products are intended to assimilate with others and to enhance the AAPL ecosphere.  All of the above is why I am long AAPL and think it is highly doubtful that I will sell my large position anytime soon.

"Spencer,There is one aspect that is mentioned in your article that deserves a lot of attention - the buybacks.  By buying back shares siri not only reduces the share count but also dramatically reduces the number of shares in the hands of retail investors.By my account, there are about 320 M shares left in retail.  The rest of the 4.9 B shares outstanding is held either by liberty (the lion's share of about 3.16 B) and institutions.  Siri is even getting attractive to foreign investors like a recent buy by a huge Dutch pension fund,according to Barron.I believe that in the next two years siri may buy back to the tune of 500 M shares (I doubt it will be more unless liberty pushes hard for another 100 M shares) thus virtually annihilating the retail or reducing it to just tens of millions versus hundreds.As the result, in 2020 siri will end up with about 3.9 to 4 BB shares overwhelmingly held by liberty and institutions (with liberty's share under 80%).  I also doubt that siri minority shareholders (about 850 M shares) would allow continued buybacks to bring liberty to full ownership.This is the time when ""games"" may begin.  I anticipate the share price at that time well over $8.  I doubt that liberty would buy us out at a reasonable premium (at least 30%).  The real question is what would happen then.  A stalemate?  I doubt it.  There must be some action here on liberty's part that would have to benefit siri shareholders as well, otherwise it could be a bad situation for everyone.",

"If SXM is using their free cash flow for buy backs and dividends, doesn't it stand to reason that other companies will do the same?

It seems you're falling into a first mover problem here. Even companies that ARE giving bonuses (usually minuscule) are also reducing staff size - which, when combined with lower overall hiring - means that more potential customers are drying up.

It should have since the whole reason behind the NWS and the bailout was the financial situation of the GSE's during the crisis. I studied communist history and I fail to see any real difference between the political environment we have in the states today and the one during the Soviet Union. Bottom line, since our economy is really based on politics rather than economics then economics does not apply to it. The Soviet Union and China under chairman Mao are more like the political environment we have here in the states. If the confiscation of private property hasn't woken up most or at least half of the American population then nothing will. Because of this, I find politics a more useful tool for investing.",
sent to 3 contacts I know at WSJ,
This mirrors my view as to what comprises an accurate synopsis of what has occurred re f&f since 2008. Can there be only 2 of 9000* who see it this way? Can the courts dare  to take honest exception and present a formidable argument?,
Does anyone thinks it's a funny coincidence that F&F get the OK to hold a 3B buffer which just happens to be only just insufficient to prevent another (small) draw on the Treasury despite the fact that everyone could have done the DTA writeoff before deciding what the new buffer was going to be?,
I think this post needs to be packaged and sent to the WSJ. It certainly contains more factual information than the recent article vomited out.,
"An alternate explanation of D.T.A. writedown loss by way of analogy. Feel free to correct the specifics, anyone. I'm going to be loose in using 35% and 21% F.I.T. which may not be the actual rates applicable to FNMA, but this should get the point across, which is how a tax rate reduction caused an immediate one-time loss.First a short explanation, basically concurring with the article: known future year carry-forward tax losses were booked as a ""receivable"" using the 2017 (""old"") assumed tax rate. The tax-bill's ""new"" tax rate is lower, so that when the losses are ultimately recognized (i.e. taxed) in the future, the actual cash effect (i.e. tax reduction) for future losses is not going to be as great as the ""receivable"" had assumed before the bill changed tax rates. So the receivable - called DTA, which is an asset like other receivables - had to be written down. It's in one sense similar to a loss carryforward expiring, where you don't get to reduce future taxes by as much as you would have, had the losses been tax deductible as soon as you put them on your income statement. In this case, FNMA doesn't get to reduce future taxes by as much as they had estimated in calculating the DTA asset, so they have to write it down. The writedown of an asset is an immediate loss.Longer explanation: Remember how in December there was a clamor for businesses to rush get their expenses incurred before 12/31/17, and likewise defer revenues to January, in order to reduce 2017 taxable income (at the higher tax rate) and identically increase 2018 taxable income (at the tax bill's new lower rate)? Assuming that those two actions would in fact affect F.I.T. taxable income as expected, then if $100 net income could be swung into 2018 by either of those two actions, it would basically be hit with the new (e.g. 21%) $21 F.I.T. instead of the 2017 (e.g. 35%) rate's $35 F.I.T.. The idea was, or is, you'd get a free lunch of 14% for every bit of [allowable] expenses accelerated, and another 14% for every bit of [allowable] revenue delayed. If you swung a net $100 income forward in time (or negative $100 backwards), ca-ching, $14 windfall. Even sweeter, and very significantly, an after tax windfall!What happened to FNMA was that it could not accelerate expenses as such, because for whatever reason, they had deferred losses, that had been recognized as current losses on their regular accounting income statements; but for F.I.T., the losses were required to be recognized (i.e. taxed) in future years. Commonly in business you have two income statements: one recognizing GAAP income (or loss, negative income), and a second one (""the tax return"") differing where some items are not permitted to be applied to taxable income (e.g., are non-deductible) - or, by tax rules, couldn't be immediately booked to taxable income, but could be practically expected to be booked in the future.So FNMA's income statements assumed a future loss of say $100, and though it couldn't be deducted yet, they booked an estimated future ""receivable"" of $35 (again, just assume 35% for sake of this illustration). But now it became apparent that the future receivable would only be $21 (21%) when the expense was finally allowed to be deducted from taxable income.Thus FNMA had to write down the DTA - which is the ""receivable"" - by $14 in our example. Scale that up, and adjust for actual effective tax rate reductions for their particular operation, and you get a ding of 11.5B - which they don't quite have enough to cover on the balance sheet (albeit only due to past government scavenging). Ergo they need to receive a check rather than write one to Washington, this one time only, for the Q4 shortfall.",

"It is official now.  Freddie Mac will require another bailout as well - only a much smaller one in the neighborhood of $0.3 billion or so.I must say, however, that I find the timing of these announcements very interesting.  I didn't expect the DTA writedowns to occur until Q1 2018, as that is when the new tax law takes effect.  And these new ""bailouts"" to consequently not hit the press until the companies officially release their Q1 2018 results in May or so.But for some reason, the FHFA used the fact that the law was signed in Dec 2017 as the basis to order the companies to write down their DTAs before the law takes effect.  There has to be some reason for that, and I would presume there was a lot of internal discussion (and probably disagreements) about when the write-downs should occur.The FHFA decided to move the timetable up by 3 months, but why?  What could their reason be?  Treasury wanting the final draws to be made as soon as possible, so they can then do final calculations for their planned restructuring?  Some judge somewhere (or negotiations with litigants) focusing on YE 2017 as some sort of important benchmark?  Or what?  Does anyone have any ideas on why the FHFA would want to move these ""losses"" forward by 3 months?",

"The government has all their eggs in one basket (Common shares).  In my opinion, two things are posed to happen.

I believe,  Private money, (Banks) would not step in at this time.  Why would they bail out the government? They are in business for the profit.  The second option, would be the government cashes in on their STOLEN profits, and encourage the banks to re-enter the housing market while its, ""stabilized"" using a set of new rules.  This makes more business sense.  There is a lot to lose, like the 30-yr mortgage and public confidence in the housing market.   The government cant afford this to happen.  What I see is the Supreme Court is going to have to show that the NWS was illegal and force the government to exit the housing market.  Until then, we have to wait patiently. I don't have a timeframe.  We must hope the right thing gets done.  Boy, politics is Corrupt and Dirty !",

"It's nice to see your articles getting more realistic that this is a political battle...period end of sentence. Recall Watt was advocating for receivership while he was working for the Obama administration and has done a 180 under the Mnuchin lead Trump administration. As I've argued ad nauseum the extreme left would like to complete the de facto nationalization of the GSE's so that they can be official tools of the government to subsidize housing. The extreme right (Corker, Hensarling) want them killed off and their functions doled out to pure(er) free market banks which would effectively eliminate the 30 year mortgage, resulting in a massive downward reset in property values which would result in home owners and renters putting substantially less money into shelter over the long term and that money would be used elsewhere in the economy.Nationalization ain't happening under republican control. When Mnuchin declared getting the GSE's out of government control was a top priority and just as importantly praised their long term value to the economy and housing market this ruled out kill and replace, and as much as guaranteed he will push for some form of recap and release. Anybody who lived through the recent great recession and saw the havoc a sharp downward reset in property values wreaked on the economy knows kill em and replace em is a pipe dream even if their is a strong long term case for doing so. Mnuchin all but said this when he praised the GSE's long term track record. Corker Hensarling et al can blather on all they want the resolution will be a middle ground version of recap and release. Who pays for the recap is the million dollar question. Regular fellow readers know my take. Existing common shareholders foot the bill in a massive equity capital raise ala re-capping TBTF which would spare preferred thus preferred are out performing common lately. The worst case scenario is receivership and re-IPO with all classes wiped out. IMO this is an unnecessarily more complicated and legally riskier version of equity capital raise to re-cap and release, thus I own some preferred.",

Just here to laugh at how many AMD articles I see every morning.,
Why doesn’t intc buy amd?,
">>Some claim developments in cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum, are making mining less profitable by reducing the block reward and lowering the difficulty level of algorithms.ROFLMAO- no, analysts don't understand any of that. The real reason is that they are counting on monopoly abuse by Intel to keep AMD from gaining market share. It always worked in the past. Go back & read citi and goldman statements. What low IQ analysts don't understand is that Intel's anti-competitive practices were helped immensely by a) AMD's poor execution and b) a growing PC/server ecosystem which enabled them to finance one shady operation with another.Well, AMD's execution under Su has not only improved vastly, its actually better than Intel's. The PC/server ecosystem isn't growing at all and in fact shrinking. Market is growing in newer areas where Intel cannot compete with Nvidia or AMD. Proof is in the pudding - AMD has grown revenues in the last 2 years and it has now accelerated to much faster growth (50% YOY revenue growth in Q1- their weakest Q). Su said in Jan that rev will follow prior year- Q3 > Q2 > Q1 and Q4 will be slightly less than Q3. So $1.6 b is the bottom for this year and analyst estimates are vastly under playing AMD.Re crypto, I don't think it would hurt AMD much if crypto were to disappear from the market tomorrow. There is enough pent up demand for discrete GPUs to absorb the resulting cards hitting ebay. AMD has deliberately kept the supply chain starved for GPUs. AMD's data center business is getting stronger and would more than compensate for any crypto deficiencies within a Q or two.",

"Congratulations to GNC for progressing the refinancing (let's hope 3rd time is a charm and they close).  I will not buy back into the stock at these levels, but it does become interesting enough to monitor again.In the cash flow analysis, need to add in refinancing/repaying the ""old"" convertible as this is required to extend the maturities.   Also, should consider flexing the interest rates up a point as there is at least a reasonable expectation that the credit rating agencies do not maintain the B2/B requirement (further downgrades could stimulate the $275 million ABL FILO becoming payable).   Long story, short - they raised approximately $272 million of new capital ($300 million of preferred less $28 million in deal expenses) at 6.5% (plus substantial dilution in the event that GNC achieves significant upside); flexed approximately 6% on existing term loan to obtain 2 year extension; terminated revolving credit facility; provided secured lenders a super secured position via FILO loan structure; and restructured the China operations giving up some of the upside to strengthen market position.   This tightens the creditors grip on the company and if things do not progress well, they have a quicker trigger (debt downgrade can result in acceleration of FILO loan).  The huge benefit is that this provides GNC with a window to perform - at this point, that is all management could ask for....",
"I actually think the company WILL BE ABLE to service its debt even despite the much higher interest burden and the vastly increased amortization requirement. But there won't be much, if any, FCF left.Moreover, the company explicitly specified $50-55 million in negative 2018 EBITDA impact relative to 2017, so EBITDA will almost certainly come in considerably lower this year.The company needs to engineer a huge turnaround in its core business over the next couple of quarters as the debt will have to be addressed AGAIN at the end of 2019 to avoid it to become current in early 2020. 2018 same store sales guidance hasn't been encouraging so they will have to deliver in 2019. Frankly speaking, I remain highly skeptical on the company's ability to turn around a business that is expected to remain under ongoing competitive pressures.",
"That was not my takeaway from Henrik's article. His point is that 2018 free cash flow will be markedly less than 2017, not that GNC cannot service its debt.I would expect that with the second half 2018 closing of the deal, and 40% dilution at $5.35, there is a ceiling on GNC's stock at ~$5 barring material improvements to the business.",GNC: The Refinancing Will Make It Across The Finish Line

"I buy from Bean and was not even aware of this ""forever"" policy.  I was looking for quality and the ability to return if dissatisfied, with no hassles.  I think this is a tempest in a teapot.We have a friend who works at Nordy's.  She's always recounting stories of the low-lights in our midst.  I really wonder where we're going with people like that.  They drive up in a high end car, from a very high end address, and routinely return summer stuff they buy every Spring and return every Fall, well used.  How can some people look themselves in the mirror every morning???",
"Their new policy is no big deal. They still stand behind their products. In fact they have the best customer service in the business. But clothing and other outdoor items do not last forever. They wear out. We can't expect Bean or anyone to guarantee against normal wear. If something wears out before a year is out, you can still return it. Still probably the most generous return policy anywhere. As the other posters have noted, the policy change was necessary to protect against scammers who wanted refunds for items 10 years old.",
"I am not a bean guy but did read through the new policy. You can still return everything. Especially defects. And return product past a year. They are just getting rid of the scum bags. Just can’t return your product (boots) every 3 years because they are 3 years old. Much ado about nothing. Also, beans and dicks/cabelas customers live on different planets",
"The lesson is that every year a higher percentage of Americans are scammers and crooks.   Get used to it - word gets out quickly on social media among the ethically challenged on how to rip off companies.  The other brands have not been around long enough to have a large supply of old worn out clothing for scammers to ""return"" for replacement.   They too will change their policy to something similar when the scammer crowd moves on to them. .I had a similar thing happen to me with the pump for the basement sump system - what used to have a lifetime warranty is now downgraded to 3 years when a replacement was sent.  Of course moving production to China had nothing to do with that, I'm sure.",L.L. Bean's Folly Is Competitors' Gains

"Let me preface my response with my lack of detailed knowledge in the the fertilizer business, but familiar with the fundamentals of supply and demand. I also recognize that stock prices don't follow fundamentals, and are tied much closer to investor sentiment than factual data.I have been looking for a decent commodity stock to add to my portfolio for about a month now, and have had my eye on NTR since the middle of January. Since NTR really doesn't have a track record yet, due to the recent merger, thought I'd wait to see how the stock price settled out, before taking an entry position in the new company.Your arguments seem valid for the long run, but short term, it looks like NTR might see a bit more pricing pain. I'm looking for a technical entry point, where a bottom has been tested, and has finally bounced off and is moving higher.Although the stock is now 20% lower than where it was when it 'went public', it appears to be testing the $44.14-44.18 range a number of times, and was challenged on Friday to break through the $44.80 price range, against a stock market which has come well off its lows from last week's sell off. The stock is definitely on weak ground at the moment, since it didn't recover like the rest of the US market has. We may have to wait awhile for this new bottom to solidify.",

"AAOI will lose a good chunk of business to OCLR. In 100G best investment in the market today in my opinion is OCLR, far less downside risk while shorts will drag down AAOI to low - mid 20s before next earnings. Then AAOI is a buy.",
The entire sector lacks whatever transparence and shorts have internal informations they cannot disclose because of the risk of insider trading. No reason to be optimistic about tomorrow earnings. Las Vegas slot machines are better than Aaoi.,

"Well, I guess there is a slight bit of hope for my March 2018 75 calls, lol!",
"The canning of AAOI falls into 2 fronts. 1 is the disbelief that it can keep growing. This is founded on thinking it is the leader in this space because of a given company and all a competitor has to do is win them over. This is false. Even if AAOI lost all of Amazon which it hasn't, it still could replace the business with others in this field where demand is rapidly growing faster than supply. Also worth noting is that its technology for now allows it the highest margins. It is not easy to replace this.The second is persistent talk about its technology not being competitive. I find this rather humorous given others are requiring all sorts of solutions to their overheating problem as they move to higher powered more expensive lasers as a solution to get to higher speeds. Technology is why you should buy AAOI right now. We will see if a better solution comes about, but for now, all the competitors coming out with a solution doesn't necessarily make them a contender, especially if they have ramp problems and reliability problems and can't compete on price.The industry has a problem all right, but its not AAOI. It is growing faster than anyone can keep up production with and many are trying to enter the market with technology that makes no sense, selling at a loss, and making statements about taking marketshare which they aren't even capable of producing as many modules as they would need to to take that marketshare. This will end in a mess for many upstart producers.",
"looks like today's price action will be driven by cisco earnings. on a side note, i don't expect meaningful amazon buying in q4 2017 or q1 2018. indicated in juniper last earnings call. buying should hopefully resume from q2 2018 onwards. sequential growth from other customers will offset this.",
"Looks like a strong Bullish Morning Doji Star candlestick pattern has formed which indicates a STRONG BOTTOM REVERSAL. The third bar (of the pattern) has a large body, indicating a strong up momentum. With the 6% up yesterday, it looks like a rather certain strong reversal here. Time to watch closely and not to take a wrong action!",
"The short position is still a staggering 9-figure amount. There is clearly at least one player that had insider info, probably from Amazon, starting from last summer and contributed a significant fraction of this short position and was right on the money all along. Ironically the shorts seemed to have better visibility than AAOI's own C-level management. Something the SEC should shed some light on if they weren't understaffed and underfunded to the point of being effectively useless. Longs should wonder why the shorts haven't covered even at these levels. Maybe they still know something we don't know.Disclaimer: long AAOI.",
"I believe that the fact that Applied Opto did not pre-annouce means that earnings will be close to the Q4 estimates they provided in November.Moreover, I suspect that some of the statements from the Oclaro conference call bode well for AAOI. Specifically:""For QSFP CWM4, we continue to see very unhealthy pricing practices in the market from many of the lower spec variants. As a result, we have decided that we will focus only on supplying our existing customers."" The way I interpret this is that Applied Opto used its cost/margin advantage to put the squeeze on its competition. Previously management has indicated that they would be able to price aggressively as they reduced cost. Starting with Q4 and going forward, margins will likely decrease. However, that margin compression should be accompanied by volume growth and increased market share.If the above proves true, the current stock price significantly undervalues AAOI's shares. Even during the rapid rise in the value of its shares during the first half of 2017, the narrative regarding the company's valuation has been dominated by short sellers for extended periods. The last 4 months has seen very little in the way of positive news for AAOI and the stock price has been pushed to a level that has completely ignored the entirety of the progress in 2017. In hindsight its clear that valuation was significantly overextended after the pre-announcement of Q2 earnings in July. I submit that the pendulum has now swung toward the other extreme.If Applied Opto meets Q4 estimates and guides above analyst projections for Q1, the stock price is bound to regain all of the lost ground since the November earnings call. From there, even without a major rebound for the optical sector, Applied Opto may well continue to gain ground if they can maintain their price/margin leadership.",

"We have all said our piece, we now sit and watch to see how the next 6-12 months play out for all our respective stocks. I will briefly reiterate my position on UA- I am not short UA- for lots of reasons- the stock could rise on optimism, founded or unfounded- I follow UA with the apparel/athleisure/retail industry. I do own large positions in skx,deck,dks,big and wsm. These companies have tremendous fundamentals supporting and underpinning them- great balance sheets, huge buybacks, massive free cash flow and improving operating fundamentals. They have also have very reasonable valuations.On a relative basis- UA is not close to these names- UA has a terrible balance sheet, zero free cash flow, no buyback, no dividend and operating fundamentals that need to improve very quickly- against competitors like nke and adidas that are only getting stronger and more aggressive. At 50-60 times earnings- UA also has a valuation 3-4 times the names listed above. I am just not sure why anyone would choose to own UA stock ahead of many other better companies with much cheaper valuations. Simple as that.Quick last point on someone talking about ""reading the tape"". Buying great companies cheaply and holding for long periods can make you 2,3,4,5 times your money. we wrote our first article on skx when it was at a pre split 20- it is now 41 after a 3 for 1 split- that's a 6 bagger- buy quality cheaply and you wont need to ""read the tape"". UA is neither great nor cheap. Stay away.And by the way- Stone Fox- UA is close to broke- read the balance sheet- nearly a billion in debt. Probably not an issue, but absolutely positively can be if business does weaken from here.",
"GR- I like you! Couldn’t have said it better myself. Plank’s appearance on Cramer was also bizarre. Pure hypester, the numbers are horrific. The stock is overvalued at 8 let alone 16- many many better stocks.",
"""First rule of investing: The tape never lies.""That's totally incorrect- the tape lies all the time. The numbers never lie. Valeant went from 240 with the Ackman play- and ultimately he puked it at 9 dollars. just cause it was at 240 doesnt mean it is worth 240. Stock prices are very very often mispriced, and I would say they lie all the time. That's our job to figure that out- going to the 10k, 10q and reported info tells you all you need to know- if you know how to read it. UA is broke, flat broke. The numbers tell you that.",
"And by the way Stone Fox- yes, I would bet against Kevin Plank- I would bet against anyone who would have a balance sheet like the company has. But he has lined his pockets all along the way, so don't cry for him. The stock gets supported at times because of people like you who buy hype and not profits. His appearance on Cramer was pure desperation.",
"I'm going to push back hard on this author. Kevin Plank started Under Armour and got it to a 5 billion dollar revenue company. Fine. As of right now, the company is way out of control operationally and has gotten destroyed by competitors and its own doing. Inventory has exploded, the operating model is barely profitable, they don't know how to segment their products across distribution channels, they spent a fortune on connected fitness which could bankrupt the company. Have you looked at the balance sheet? They do not have the capital to compete and grow to where they want to be. As it is, they have only projected to be barely profitable in 2018. Every other company in their industry is at near peak profitability- what happens when a downturn comes? Take a guess.As for Kevin Plank on Cramer last night. He is a joke- pure showman and hypester. He should not be on Cramer, he should be figuring out how to dump the 1.15 billion of inventory on his balance sheet. They are not good operators, their supply chain is terrible and that will take time to correct. Every retail company got a massive benefit from the corporate tax cut- except ua- because they don't make any money. How about Dick's sporting goods- dks- same industry- 10 times earnings, growing sales, no debt, 800 million buyback, raised dividend. Why would you waste your time and money with Under Armour? Price sales ratio? dks does 8 billion with a 3.3 billion market cap- .4 price to sales ratio. cant get cheaper than that.Wake up author.",
"Wow!!! Comparing IBM/Microsoft to UAA/NKE.  Microsoft flourished home computing to the world while IBM was in mainframe computing, two totally different fields. UAA has just copied everything that existed already, sneakers, clothing, and tried to fool investors by concocting stories about innovation. The quality of the product is ho-hum and innovation is non-existence. Mr. Plank uses China mostly for production and then thumps his chest for made in America, stuff.  This is not how leaders conduct. My fellow investors, according to Barrons on the latest quarter ""Inventories swelled some 26% from a year ago. Gross margin declined. And the store count rose 22%, twice the speed of that direct-to-customer revenue. That suggests weak same-store sales."". This is called bought revenue. People who bought UAA at 2015 high, their money is underwater by -66%. While NKE bought @2015 high have made some money. You be the judge!!",
"A couple more points - there is no doubt that almost all numbers today make NKE look better than UAA but so did IBM look much better than Microsoft in 1982 - how far did that get you?If you look at the article, it shows that NKE has grown revenue about 85% over the last 10 years while UAA has grown 690%. Now that isn’t too far off my projections for the next 10 years - NKE 50-70% and UAA has the potential for 400%. Any small company in a big market can have potential to grow, but almost all never do. So what is different here - UAA has a proven track record of having done so for 10 years with a founder that is driven. That is what distinguishes an Apple and Microsoft from a nobody. Past success portends future success.So where can this go wrong. Well NKE may expand into new lines to expand their growth - they may go into men’s work suits and women’s work outfits or maybe they go into energy drinks or maybe they expand into broadcasting sports or making movies - that could expand their revenue faster, but that usually is the worst idea to go into a business you know nothing about. They are limited by their size and expertise. Apple innovated new technological industries, I don’t see athletic gear growing much faster than inflation and population growth, but you never know people may stop working and exercise more - that is possible.On the other hand UAA may have hit its limit and its founder may have lost his magic touch. That’s what makes a market - nobody knows what will happen and the future is unknown with an infinite number of possibilities.  But remember when they fired Steve Jobs and ran Apple into the ground. Apple rose like a phoenix when Jobs was brought back. Gates was Microsoft. Over and over, it is the driven founder that makes a company succeed - not the Ivy League managers who come in a generation later and run the business into the ground while taking fat paychecks while having no idea how to grow a business or take risk.So again past success portends future success and dynamic driven founders are just a few parts of what differentiates a small company that will succeed in a big market from a small company that will be crushed by the big boys.The future just turned bright with revenue growth and the ticker never lies. Happy days are here again!",
"First rule of investing: The tape never lies.For all the naysayers out there, the blast off with the earnings announcement tells you that the big money sees the future very differently than your negative light. Some of you may be short while others have seen the shares go down for a long time and have been right on the negative side and typically the trend is your friend. So you are sticking with what has worked.But this looks like a trend reversal and for the naysayers - the question is why.My numbers are going to be off but somewhere in the ballpark. They currently sell 75% in the US and 25% overseas with growth of 45% overseas and shrinkage of 5% USA.Comparing revenues to NKE, they are about 1/10 the sales and NKE is 50% US and 50% overseas. They are trying to compete with the big boys on sponsorship to grow the future and the naysayers are saying they are incompetent with low margins that will never expand. Their margins are low because they have to spend more as a percentage of revenue to compete.Well looking at it simply, the news was VERY bright. The main fear of the market was shrinking revenues meant they would go bust.  But they now have growing revenues because overseas is outpacing USA.  Just projecting out, one can easily predict that soon, as in 3-5 years its likely that their overseas revenue will match their US at 50:50. If US sales stay the same, that would mean 50% revenue growth from here.But US growth will not be static, it will likely start rising too which means you could see a doubling of revenue in 3-5 years. At that point they are 1/5 the revenue of NKE. Their margins will have improved because of the higher sales. They will likely be able to get better and more sponsorship expanding name recognition and accelerating revenue growth. That is the future the market is seeing - revenue growth of 45% overseas along with returning to overall revenue growth means the future is bright. When revenue was shrinking the future was bleak - very simple.So yes P/S is more important than earnings when you are the small guy playing with big boys and your margins are hurt by having to compete. The point is UAA has the opportunity to grow sales by a HUGE amount while the big boys have no such ability, so in fact the smaller guy should trade at a premium to the big boy because the growth potential is larger.  From here, in 3-5 years they could see a doubling of sales and another doubling out to 10 years - NKE no such luck maybe 50-70% growth in sales over 10 years due to inflation and population growth if they are lucky enough not to lose market share. Compare that to a potential 400% growth in sales over 10 years for UAA. Now think about that - where will the prices for NKE and UAA be at that point when the P/S of UAA is 1/2 of NKE today.  If the P/S for NKE remains the same, then in 10 years their share price rises 50-70% from here but UAA in this rosy tale could go up 800% in 10 years! (4X growth in revenue to become 40% the size of NKE and a doubling of P/S to equal NKE) Now do you see why the share price went up???The tape doesn’t lie. It’s all pretty simple - your hopes and desires don’t matter - the numbers matter. UAA’s revenue is growing so this picture I painted has a possibility of coming true - I’m not saying it will, but I am saying it just became possible and that’s a lot more than can be said for NKE - they have no opportunity to achieve that type of performance because they are too big.So you can look at next quarter and say they don’t know what they are doing or you can look at 3, 5, and 10 years out and say the future looks bright when you have 45% overseas growth in sales! Along with overall revenue growth means you are a growing brand that will survive not a brand that is going into the dust bin.",

the authors fundamental argument is that it's undervalued on a price-to-sales basis relative to its competition what the author fails to understand is the reason they demand higher price to sales multiples is because they have higher levels of profitability and higher profit margins if Under Armour can achieve the gross margins of say n k e then it would deserve its price to sales.,

If you are still interested, this is not a missed opportunity but a short squeeze so wait for 3-5 weeks and you will get it at the level, that authors is making you believe you missed out on.

Nice read as usual 👍,
">2400G ($170 MSRP) - To put together a computer with comparable CPU and GPU performance to a 2400G, one must purchase a $186 Intel i5-8400 AND a $100 Nvidia GT 1030 for a grand total of $286. In other words, a computer with a 2400G saves me from paying about 68% more on a comparable machine with Intel and Nvidia parts.The far more relevant comparison is to the very popular GT 1030 + Pentium G4560 combination at the same $170 price point (which I suspect is why AMD priced it that way).  The i5-8400 + GT 1030 is an artificial  pairing created only by AMD for spec comparison purposes, I doubt anyone actually buys that combination of parts, it makes no sense for >99% of workloads (for example, for $286 most gamers would buy the G4560 + GTX 1050, plus have a few bucks left over). Don't just regurgitate AMD's marketing spin, actually *think* about real-world needs.  AMD's comparison of the Ryzen 7 to the Broadwell-E 6950 a year ago was equally pointless and misleading -- no one looking at the R7 1800X was ever seriously thinking about buying the 6950; what they actually ended up comparing it to was the 7700K.",
NIce article and thanks for defining the sweet spot so well.  It will be hard to resist for OEM's and consumers.  Timing is not in the high season but the APU advantage is not readily replicated by a competitor.  The advantage should last through a fairly long window of time.  Long AMD,
"Anybody using a current AMD APU can attest to the fact of other than being hamstrung by a HDD at start up, one is hard pressed to see any difference in actual programs.   If you look at how far behind AMD's 28 nm APUs are behind in benchmarks it seems that after closing 75% of the gap with Raven Ridge one will be even more hard pressed to feel any difference.Now, if these APUs get put in builds with HDD drives as opposed to SSDs by OEMs it will be more of the same in customer perception. Time will tell.",
"@author, thanks for the great article.One very interesting aspect, as highlighted by some reviewers, is the scalability and expand ability that the AM4 socket platforms now offfers: users can start cheap, compact and energy efficient with those APUs and later drop a more powerful CPU and a GPU (once GPU prices become more acceptable). Intel is completely out of that picture with their change of socket. AMD is much more future proof.Another consideration regarding the disappearance of GPUs for gamers: If game studios still want to sell PC games, they might see the optimization of their games for those APUs as priority #1!And...last but not least @Apple: Now the time to release a whole new range of Macs with those APUs!

"At the end of the day as investors in Tesla, the real questions are what is their ROIC, and what is their business plan?Now and for the foreseeable future Tesla, as a relatively new manufacturer, will continue to use financing to build products, production lines, and factories.  This implies financing from current operations, stock sales, bonds, and bank loans.  Due to the aggressive marketing of their products, this implies negative cash flows.However, at some point they will reach a break even point.  Their break even point has continued to move away from them as they burn cash to bring new products, but they are getting closer to this moving break even point as their learning curve knowledge has matured.I believe that some investors see this.  This is not a company promoting vaporware hardware which never materializes.  On the contrary, they tend to pre-announce products to measure up the potential future demand to size up their expenditures in plant, equipment, and human resources.As long as they continue to bring new products to the market these dynamics will continue, but at some point their past efforts will start to yield benefits in moving older products to break even points, and at some point the cumulative efforts of introducing new, different product lines will overcome their historical expenses as their sales increase.This happened already in the past in a single quarter in which their rate of spending was overcome buy their income.  However, with a new company with new products as explained above this again has become a moving target.On the other hand, if you believe that all these efforts are futile, then by all means stay away from this stock, but as a stock investor you will have to make up your mind one way or another.  Buyer beware.",
"$75 is retail for the installed pack.  This implies a much lower cost to manufacture the battery pack.Another point to keep in mind is that battery manufacturers are aware of future supply constraints for Cobalt, and they are directing their research to other chemistries.Current viable research is moving in the direction of Silicon, Sulphur, and Graphene oxide.  These elements are cheap and abundant.  In another ten years, I would expect this to be the chemistry of electric vehicle batteries.

Interesting facts. So cobalt is a smaller part of the cost than I thought. How do you think KATFFs new mines will change costs - if at all?,
Read a great comment about Tesla today.  Son't short this stock- move on to something where logic and fundamentals make sense on Teslaon,
"Recent 1.8 billion in bonds trading today at less than 93 cents on the dollar.  The bond buyers post issuing have always been better predictors of a company's future than stock buyers.  Perhaps because they have a better understanding of risk.  Every one of those initial purchasers has been torched and there is a real risk they will not be repaid.  80 cents on the dollar we will see in six months or less.  Tesla credit downgrade coming, weak Q1 model S and X sales, continued model 3 fiasco, and rising interest rates.",

"As if battery technology is going to stand still. People are working hard on alternate technologies including sodium for lithium. It's tough, but one big hurdle has been removed. You don't have to test a battery for 10 years to see how well it will last over a ten year period. That same testing can be done in 6 months instead including both cycle aging and calendar aging. The current worldwide focus on battery chemistries, computer modeling, and cell construction is enormous and still building. I suspect Lithium and Cobalt will be be replaced by cheaper and more mundane materials in the medium term. At the same time, they are going to find Lithium and Cobalt in a whole lot of places that haven't looked at yet, perhaps under the Montana Skeptic's house since both Lithium and Cobalt are found in Montana.",
"I don’t disagree or agree but one thing that consultants have always shown to me is that they are rarely correct when it comes to costs. I would have thought that those cost predictions could have variations of 20-30% there’s so much variability at play.Mining cost is high at the moment, production volume in mining is likely to increase due to high value of market, dollar valuation, transport costs assumed, volume of models, volume of other unit use cases (S, 3, X, Y, Truck, PW2, PP) the volume could be 3 to 4 times out on scale. The Chinese effect on the market (look what happened with solar and how much that crashed - granted there’s commodity cost here).It’s a useful bench mark but definitive cost it is not.",

"@jp very informative and bewildering as always:'he expects Tesla to have cell level costs of $122 per kWh and pack level costs of $157 per kWh.'so putting it simply, the simple addition of above results in $279 per kwhIs this the apples-to-apples comparison where TSLA argues cell cost will fall below $100 per kwh in the near future?Thanks in advance",

"Valuable information as always, John. I fully expect the Tesla fans will shower you with the customary appreciation.I have read speculation that the Model 3 LR version has 75 kWh battery pack. Perhaps someone here has different or definitive information. If 75 kWh, that would work out to a bit shy of $12k for the battery pack, assuming the pack cost estimated by Mr. Anderman.I would guess Mr. Anderman's pack cost calculation is based on an automated module and pack assembly line running as designed. Which, of course, may not quite yet be the case in Nevada.The Nevada calculations do get a bit complicated because Tesla must ""pay"" the depreciation on the factory building and pay Panasonic for its equipment investment plus some [redacted] ROI. I'm not sure whether or how all that would fit into Mr. Anderman's calculations. Perhaps it would all wash out.One further thought. Acculader (quite knowledgeable in this area) believes Tesla uses extra cells in its batteries -- that is, includes more cells than necessary for the stated capacity. The idea is to disguise (or, if you wish, ameliorate) degradation. (Perhaps that's only for the S&X, but not the 3. I'm not sure.)If true, I assume that would affect the pack cost calculation.",

A 64-layer 3D NAND device is price competitive and will remain the sweet spot for some time. “64-layer technology will be a long-term technology node in 3D NAND,” IBS’ Jones said. “It’s the same way as 28nm is for logic.”In China, there is less urgency to migrate to the next iteration-96-layer 3D NAND technology. The cost-per-bit benefit is less dramatic here. “When you go to 96 layers, the cost reduction is maybe 10% to 15%. When you go to 128 layers, it’s may be another 5%,” Jones said.'",

"Now I feel better about making a stock price prediction to come to fruition in the next 3 years.

But here is Cramer realizing the colas wars are over so KO with a 5% growth selling at 25PE,  that PE was depressed  ecause of too much competition?  And now that it’s all over and growth is a whopping 5%+, bingo 25PE.  Nobody should be surprised that David Tepper has made MU his #1investment.My conclusion is simple this stock is worth at least its growth forward 5years 27% or 27PE.

"Here is something to make everybody a bit chipper!The Nikkei’s Cheng Ting-Fang relates that Apple has been talking to Yangtze Memory Technologies, a Chinese state-backed operation, to buy NAND parts sometime in 2019, without citing sources.Ellis doesn’t see a potential China deal as a threat to Micron Technology (MU) and other memory-chip producers, but he does see it as a big boost the equipment makers — if it happens:We’re finally starting to get some of the equipment demand positives we’ve been awaiting for the past year from a slew of China mega projects we believe are under-modeled and under-appreciated in SS CY18-20 forecasts. Diving in, overnight Nikkei reported AAPL’s discussions with Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMT) for NAND flash purchases. Spoiler alert - this will likely be classified by peak cyclers as the latest fundamental risk though as we’ve reported for nine months YMT’s bit density and yield adjusted output seem likely to sharply underperform bearish hopes even as spend for that output sharply increases equipment company revenues.Specifically: 1) we believe there are three China NAND projects scoped at 300k WPM so to fully equip these would add ~$18B to industry spend from start to completion; however, 2) at present, we’ve uncovered just 30k of production equipment orders which hit in early 2018, or a 2% addition to industry supply on a headline basis; 3) that said, since actual supply additions are likely a fraction of that since YMT’s bit density is likely just 33% of 2H18’s industry standards (32-layer versus 96-layer) and since yields are likely just 50% or so, which means a 15% good bit output equivalent; 4) the further rub for potential purchasers is that trailing edge bit density would typically have a much higher bit cost than leading edge (i.e. AAPL suppliers SK Hynix or WDC and Samsung and MU more broadly) even before considering substantial overhead absorption differentials; so 5) we suspect these discussions are either for large supplier price leverage, some lower volume product where trailing edge NAND is applicable, or a little of both, and/or 6) the announcement simply foreshadows a more substantial 2018&2019 YMT capacity ramp with still unchanged product positioning, and 7) our analysis and checks suggest benefits from such a more substantial ramp are largely excluded from the current industry spending calculus from larger equipment companies as well SS CY18-20 estimates. Recall our view is the 300k WPM of YMT NAND, which we count as three projects given three separate shells, is complemented by four other projects (DRAM and Logic/Foundry) which we believe add up to $45.0B in CY18-22 spend as China builds out its semiconductor industry in the next 5-7 years or so.In closing, we note aforementioned mega projects are complemented by 6-7 smaller mature process foundry projects (i.e. 60nm or 40nm, ) as well as 5-6 established and well known international chip company projects, which are better captured in industry spending projections and thus SS estimates (i.e. INTC, Hynix, Samsung, etc projects).",

">Intel and Micron are dropping 3D NAND as a result.Remarkable if true - and a failure of the 3D process, I'd say.If true.

At least in theory.>3D XPoint is currently being sold to any off-the-street yokel >who wants to pony-up the cash to buy it (less than $50 to start)Probably production problems limit any wider availability but they need to run a production line to try to learn how (and if) they can do better.>The non-silicon ""chalcogenide"" switching technology in 3D XPointHas Intel/Micron yet admitted this publicly?  I'll concede it is likely true, but I'm still asking.>""Chalcogenide semiconductors don't become viable until >about 20 nanometers, which is where 3D XPoint is now"", >indicated Wicker.Absurd. I'd want to see a lot of science to even consider the idea that a glassy resistance phase change, scales better than charge buckets. I mean they are already smaller, but the question is whether there is any way to further shrink them. Just as the charge buckets do not scale down well, the basic physics prevents.  Anyway the fabrication of anything below 10nm becomes the challenge, whatever the underlying technology.So when, in your universe, will Intel/Micron announce this and stop wasting their time on NAND?",
"S.B. So patent#20170177478 and it is her. You take it from there. The other stuff is MU can't do processor. Even they came with some very smart solution called Automata(scallable, very important-  video can be found on Youtube from 2014, can you believe that?). The problem with that is they need the core, and Intel has the monster inside now called Stratix X. I highly suspect Nervana has had that type of  prototype working and Intel made a chip of it.IoT chips do not make money. Those are products only for the Chinese for sunflower seeds on 40nm with cut throat margins if you are lucky, and you need to sell millions to make hundred of thousands. Example. ATMEGA328P, which is the most used in the enthusiasts developers world thru Arduino costs around $1.50. Also, Microchip which is one of the biggest based on Wikipedia sells over 1B = Billion processor every year and revenue for 2016 is around $2.1B. Intel makes that from their IoT segment which was created 4 years ago, for 6 months. So MU and processors?! I am sorry, but I had to pour some boiled water on that idea. We are currently entering into the hybrid era of compute an Intel has all the pieces FPGA, GPU IP, CPU, Memory, Photonics, Omni-Path, EMIB and Software, plus the manufacturing in the backyard. I also thought buying MU is going to be a good choice, back in 2016, but now I see no reason for that. The amount of money Intel will make from memory will be = to MU revenue in the next 2 years.",

The company is so well placed in a fearful market going for such deep discounts... However I feel right now this stock is not logical and the stock can be quite the yoyo with volatility, but if you can stomach it and realize the opportunity to cost average and add when the price retracts, in the end I think the people holding shares will all do very well. Read, read, read and look into this company!! You'll be pleasantly surprised and yet in for a bit of a head scratcher!And depending on your patience and long term view, at the end of the day there are so few outcomes where this stock is as risky as it may seem with volitility.. at current valuations. Make your own list... write down all the positives and negatives you can possibly think of... that positive list is an awfully lot longer!!! And yet it is being priced as if the company has seriously unrecoverable issues...Unless you are investing with money you really don't have and/or honestly can't afford to suffer a ""loss"" with short term... there isn't many safer no-brainer bets in my opinion right now in this sector, and even solid individual investments overall in the market...Eventually, something will give, and when it does it will happen very fast...

Moving from cells to arrays is at least a 3 year period and then you have build a fab that can hit yield budgets. $20-30 billion( $10 billion before you even understand feasibility) and 8 years sounds right.Way long MU and INTC",

Thank you great article    MU LONG,
This sounds great for micron but what is the market size for this SoC?  There is certainly a limit to the cpu power and memory size that can be combined on a single chip.  This seems to limit the market potential to a narrower range of applications.  As you mentioned this could be huge for IoT and that will be a huge market in itself but this approach may not play as well in data center and retail unless there is a performance advantage.,
"As usual, I took the time to read your article twice.  Wow.  I waited until I was home, tin foil hat on, to key a response.  I have offices just down the road from the IMFT Lehi Fab, and let me tell everyone that ""the bees are busy in Utah"" making a ""whole lot of something"" -- 3DXPoint, Optane, Quantx, or whatever name they want to give it.I believe that the move for the new CFO was to set up an acquisition.  I don't know if Ernie had the ""chops"" to see through a $100 Billion dollar deal (is what I believe Micron will sell for), although he will stay on to ""consult.""  If the first proposal is less than $100 BB, then it will get bid up to $100 BB by another big player.I know that both E. Phred and W. Tidwell have said it before me, and I am sure Stephen had it in his head long ago as well, but for the last 2 years I have been ""yawping"" from the rooftops that this is a natural acquisition for Apple.  Apple needs memory.  Apple runs huge datacenters, needs this for their phones (as they are in a disadvantage vs. Samsung) and need it for their ""home, auto, etc."" (not to mention computers).  Micron basically helps Apple in its weakest point, in a very strong way (vertical integration, which should help the HSR process) as well as add a lot of money to its bottom line (lets not forget how much cash Micron is producing).  Additionally, the fact that they have the CASH without need of leverage is HUGE -- put that cash hoard to work.Now Apple purists don't believe in ""vertical integration"" -- however, they will continue to lose margin as they don't own their screens or memory (and memory would run iCloud).  So if it is not Apple, then who?Stephen added AVGO (which, notably, just put together $100 BB dollars <from the likes of Silver Lake no less> and they are ""getting together"" to talk about the ""merger.""  I wonder... what if the float of the offer to buy QCOM has ALWAYS been a smoke screen, and AVGO has really been putting together the money to buy Micron?  I have theorized this (tin hat in position) as why buy QCOM while they are in the midst of a legal mess with Apple (and the world) and trying to consummate an acquisition of their own, NXPI (which, who knows where that is).Find tuning my TF Hat, to get the ""SB Wavelengths"" to try QCOM -- only makes sense to me if done in a coordinate fashion WITH AVGO, and WOW would that be a SHOT at Apple.Other than the potential AVGO ""smokescreen"" I don't get the vibes of either AVGO or QCOM.Now to IBM.  IBM is a lost ship, ... no rudder, no captain, and only a glimmer of hope in AI (Watson), blockchain (??) and some cloud.  I have zero/none/ zip-old confidence in IBM to do much, let alone grasp and exploit 3D Phontonic Phase Change Memory.So let me add my thoughts along with the above.  I do see an acquisition in the wings, think it most likely would be Apple (but could see Intel if Micron is out or sells off, or is not too big a percent of the NAND <remember the legal research?>)... and Intel makes sense, as (1) I think that Intel is smart, and therefore must (2) know the REAL value of this Persistent ""Phase Change"" memory and must be in PANIC if Micron exercised their CALL OPTION (which would leave Intel very under compensated).  But have we already seen Intel's panic?  CEO sells all his shares.  They break with Intel on 3D NAND (granted to make more 3DXPoint), but what if he knows that Intel had to separate the NAND because Micron is GETTING BOUGHT by someone else... and thus the CEO dumps the stock knowing he will (INTEL) will not be getting Phase Change....  I just think that Intel has SWALLOWED so much lately that they would or may be hard pressed to swallow Micron.So who else?  I would not leave Cisco out of the equation... they know virtualized networks and cloud optimization, and would get them back into the power position to which they are trying to climb.  VERY OUTSIDE SHOT.One thing though, is that I think that it will need to be a USA or EUR company, and not Asian.... or I could see the government getting in the way again.For US companies, lets just take the 3 largest players in the Cloud, who are all cutting edge AI, software, and need (and could afford) to buy Micron.Microsoft;Amazon; orAlphabet (Google).Whoever makes the 1st bid on Micron, if not $100 Billion (again, AVGO's magic number that has ALREADY been raised/put together to raise), will be countered as the ""why"" (i.e., Phase Change new memory will come out) so if Apple starts, then Microsoft, Amazon or Google will get in the hunt, and if anyone other than Apple, then Apple gets in the hunt after an offer is made.CEO has set things up for a ""big"" sale before.  I think that he has put in his team to do it again.  I think that he wants this ""new memory"" (which may be a battle of some sorts with Samsung down the road) to be ""partnered"" out.... and in the CLOUD (i.e., POWERING THE CLOUD).Notwithstanding all of the foregoing, we finally saw some positive action in Micron share price and believe in what Joe Albano set up in a nice article that once Micron breaks above $45 it is (more or less) off to the races ($75 or so).  Cheers to Micron, all the longs, tin foil hats, and believers in the prophecies of Asimov, Clarke, Bradbury, Wells, etc., and yes, even Stephen Breezy -- a drink to you my friend, thanks for the articles and insights, and even fun reading (prophecy I mean :-)Live long and prosper.

"Breezy:As a fellow ECD shareholder alumnus, I can enthusiastically say congratulations on pulling together a bunch of difficult stuff.For me, Jim Handy has lost a lot of credibility with his constant calls for a memory pricing apocalypse.  Maybe, like a broken clock that is right twice a day, if he keeps saying it long enough it will become true.I've long felt (and written about a couple of times here on SA) that the largest buyer of Flash in the world, Apple, is the likely buyer of Micron.  These days, with Micron's fancier market cap, I could see some consortium deal which might include Intel and Apple as the primary players.  I suppose Apple could carve out some first leader status where they have this new tech in phones and pads before their competition.  Intel wouldn't mind since they aren't in that business.  IBM needs to remake themselves and has done an awful lot of work, and owns a bunch of patents in the PCM space.  But I just don't see them getting out of their underwear in time for this event.  Agree with comments here that Samsung and Broadcom can't be players due to both size and foreign status.Your article is already novel length and I know you have covered this elsewhere.  Don't forget the optical properties of PCM and Intel's work in that area.  The world may not be ready for optical interconnects at the chip level-- as Intel has constantly been promising and under delivering.  But when it is, won't it be wonderful to have a memory with lots of nifty optical characteristics on the other end of the fiber?Keep these Breezy epistles coming!",
intel owns ip for 3dxpoint but its only for memory... no micron license needed. intel is not using pcm in any intel factory today . intel will not use pcm in any logic process ever. i think breezy previously said 10nm was fake and would be pcm... sorry facts ruin a good fairy tale by breezy.,

"SB-With Intel having so much at stake, so much invested and per your own writings, a multi-year head start, do you honestly think they would let this slip away and let Micron ride awaywith the billions of dollars that you envision? Me thinks not-If 3DXP is as good as advertised,there is no way that Intel  won't be as substantially involved and rewarded monetarily, as Micron. Whether a buyout is in the offing, or behind closed door words/agreements are exchanged, both these companies (and their investors) will be rewarded handsomely.",

Could Microns recent stock offering in any way be in part to dilute shareholder(s) anywhere near that 5% poison pill threshold ..?,
"Stephen,Yes. WebFeet Research revealed this at SNIA's Persistent Memory 2018 Summit several weeks ago. Not the history part but the actual device which is called NVRAM - a DRAM replacement. They also explained that it was ideal for consumer based systems - a near perfect marriage of storage and memory. The idea that a portion of the memory can be used as a ""slow"" (16-32 bits per cell) byte addressable memory.  The idea of mixing dense memory with Random Access leads to the conclusion that Flash may not have a place in the mobility segment. The idea of trading off ""memory drives"" within main memory is still a new concept and hasn't been publicly digested yet - more fun to come on that account soon.The SNIA PM 18 ""Analysts Weigh In on Persistent Memory"" slide set is here;http://bit.ly/2C0BWsf-Growlzler",

"The other part of the credit debacle is the sub-price book and operationally, SIG is still very inefficient.  While the previous CEO knew the jewelry market very well, operationally, SIG ran like a mom & pop and it still does today.  The new CEO had no jewelry background but some ops experience way back when she was with P&G but that likely won't be enough in a retail and economic environment that is ever more volatile.  H2 the economy will start to slow and likely SIG already is seeing more and more retail locations underperforming and its not like they can get out of the leases quickly short of covenants being blown.  Mall operators (think Simon Properties) have become very aggressive with tenants trying to break leases unless a top tier location that can be filled with higher rent.  Add to his, much too much redundancy in their ops, like their HQ in Akron Ohio and a brand new ops center in Dallas. Absolutely no need for both locations and the corresponding headcount.  If the new CEO does not perform well the next 6-9 months, do not be surprised if a PE firm gets their hands on the company as it is ripe for financially engineering.

"Thanks for sharing. I m currently vested in  Yongsheng Advance Materials and below is the investment thesis. wonder if u ve looked at this company before.1.	Yongsheng Advance Material (HK:3608) is a niche producer of differentiated polyester yarns and a provider of dyeing services for differentiated fabric based in China. 2.	Since listing in 2013, its manufacturing division has consistently commanded above average gross margins (>25%) compared to its peers (~11%) by virtue of its niche products and efficiency in operations. In fact, more than 90% of its products are differentiated PFY with various special properties.3.	Its fabric dye processing facilities is highly efficient and deploys technology that uses significantly less water and electricity in the dyeing process. It is hardly affected by China’s crackdown on pollution which affected many of its peers and commands >40% margins in this segment4.	It is a leading innovator in China’s textile industry with more than 40 patents and works closely with regulators to define industry standards for differentiated polyester yarn production/process5.	Despite operating in a widely perceived sunset industry, Yongsheng managed to grow operating profit and net profit at a CAGR of 11% and 19% respectively since listing.6.	Net cash position trading at a trailing PE of just 6.6x and EV/EBIT of 3.2. It operates with an average ROE >15% and ROIC >27% since listing. Dividend yield is attractive at 4% with a payout ratio between 25-30% since listing. 7.	Upcoming catalysts that could re-rate valuations upwards:- (i)	Expecting revenue in 2018 to grow by at least 20% as major capacity addition for its differentiated polyester yarn comes online in Q4-2017. (ii)	Management plans to spin off its manufacturing division into a separate entity from its processing and trading division. This could unlock value for shareholders.",

"First - YOU are NOT qualified to speak on the technical aspects of prioritized data. This is where YOU are as misinformed and confused about the strategic plans of Telecom and the technical implications for Net Neutrality as is the average consumer. YOU cannot either speak to the benefits of 'N.N' to the consumer or the real threats that 'N.N' imposes on Telecoms!

Net Neutrality - has very little to do with the operating margins of Telecom RATHER their lack of leadership does - strategic, innovative, marketing or otherwise! I've been there so I know.

"While an IPO for the Latin American unit sounds good to some since when does this giving up a nonstrategic international asset constitute improve services and options for domestic consumers? The FCC needs to really reconsider what's at stake for the consumer and customers for a company that's part of a duopoly where given the recent net neutrality ruling allows (T) & (VZ) to operate with impunity. Considering the latter, (T), (VZ) and Comcast has closed the loop on the service options for consumers and can funnel the disgruntled towards the basic service options that each offer which only competes with ""free TV."" The best compelling argument made by the FCC since the breakup of ""Ma Bell"" is that they fail to have the consumer's best interest in mind.

"Giovanni said: ""The market is corrupt, this is factual."" You just won me over as a fan!Here's my take on the corruption: SWN and CHK are both being sold short to cause investors to panic and sell out. The seller is the same in both stocks (and in many other small caps). The manipulator has DEEP POCKETS and owns major stakes in both SWN and CHK. He knows the share price will rocket back up just as soon as he stops manipulating the stock. All he wants to do now is run off the small investors and accumulate more cheap shares from those that can't hang due to margin calls and fear of losing everything.This is some real sick stuff. Trump said he would drain the swamp but it appears that he just made the swamp bigger and turned thousands on more alligators loose. My next move is report the manipulation to the SEC but I doubt if they will do anything. They are likely part of the scam! Short selling was banned in bank stocks. I think it should be banned/limited is all stocks. If you have many millions, you can drive any small cap into the ground and sweep of the scraps for yourself. This is wrong in a bigway!",
If in the last two weeks you sold at 4 and bought at 2 isn't that a wash sale ? or amI missing something?,
A doubling of CHK gets a lot of investors back to cost. Not so great really.,

"When Giovanni made that wrong call to buy at that time, I posted a reply advising to not take his advise, stating that I was trying to save people money by advising that they should not take that advise at that time.  My post was deleted.  This author and SA are complicit in that.  But, being a shark, I can accept that my posts can tend to be a bit biting and colorful (the color of blood), which may have contributed to the deletion.  G, you know what I’m talking about, because I posted it twice, even once after it was deleted, and later adding that SA are a bunch of queefs, stating that we are “men making markets” and that the colorful nature of some contributors, like myself, should be allowed.  That being water under the bridge, I agree with G’s call now, as I too have called this a contrarian buy at this time.I focus on global macros, and I won’t go into all of the gory details here, but I can say that I am sure that Goldman Sachs recent upgrade on the target price of $80 oil within 6 months is accurate. See here:  https://bloom.bg/2BuVGDeThe bottom line is that, if you are a contrarian, bottom-feeding shark looking in the energy sector (oil/natgas), CHK is the definition of buy at this time.  I can’t make a call on the perfect timing, or price at which to buy, but for the longs I can say that one should accumulate now, and I can also say that there will likely be a bit of turbulence until the end of March.  The turbulence is a result of further reverberations from the recent 10% correction, the fed’s next move, and some remaining refinery maintenance disruptions.  The good news on refinery maintenance disruptions is that March is estimated to be 55% less disruptive than last year; we are already noticing the positive effect of the 35% less disruptions for Jan and Fed, as you can see in the uptick in oil price today.  See article here:https://bloom.bg/2BO0moNAlso, there are several geopolitical risk premium factors being reintroduced, namely Venezuela, and Israel-Iran war igniting from embers resulting from the recent practice runs in Syria. I’ll say it again, I agree with G, as I too have called this THE contrarian buy in the soon to be lime-lit energy sector.Now let’s hope for a meaningful asset sale, used solely to pay down debt, while maintaining, and even turning up production on remaining wells with max efficiencies.  Let’s actively demand it.Now let’s see if this post gets deleted.",

There are plenty of giant fields both in the US, Canada, offhshore GOM and Norway, and in the Eastern Med. But like The Graduate, the future could be plastics, in part, and natgas has gone a long way to displacing coal and nuclear. There's more to the demand side than the day to day weather/storage levels and the shorter term production/drilling rig watchers are recognizing. JMHO.",

"Author, here's the problem with natural gas stocks. If they drill baby, drill, all that cash flow goes in the well with the sand and water, year after year. Sure production goes up, but what is it worth 3-5 years out? Unknowable, so a lot of shareholder money gets wasted. Marcellus is low cost, but it's low cost for everybody drilling out there, so prices follow the downtrend with all the production ramps and thus returns go down.However, if a company turns off the drilling when the prices & returns aren't there, and instead returns capital to shareholders, reduces debt (whatever is the best option), then value gets created. They just need to take it a year at a time, especially the low cost producer. For example, CNX Resources, read their call transcripts, their 2016 annual letter, that company understands how to run a gas company. AR could be there, they are getting some pressure from sailingstone, but on the conference call AR is still keeping with growing production 18% CAGR to 2022 - bad move, they could easily hold production steady after 2018 and return excess capital the wells generate. Shareholders would come out further ahead and all the unused wells remain in the bank for the future. Tough to believe their free cash flow forecasts when they are not hedged all the way out.",

"Good article.  I went to work for the Country's largest oil company in 1955 as a Petroleum Engineer.  The standing joke (?) was ""If you mess up, you will be transferred to the Natural Gas Division.""  NG was 5 Cents/MCF when you could find a market.   Then came the era of the Federal Power Commission during which the federal government  protected consumers from NG price gouging so effectively that the only gas being added to supply was that being produced with oil (casinghead).  The prevailing price the FPC set for NG was 19 Cents.  I had a group of investors that I journeyed to Hartford, CT, to meet with once a year.  I always spent a good bit of time explaining that natural gas prices were about to take off.  In the Q & A,  a guy who had been investing for several years said, and I quote:  ""Harry, every year you come up here and tell us natural gas prices are going up and one of these years you are going to be right.""  And there you have the story of natural gas in a nutshell.",
Natural gas is projected to be cheaper year by year.   It is a byproduct of oil production for many wells.  It used to be simply flared off.   Oil producers will sell gas at any price.  The higher the price for oil the more oil will be produced and the more natural gas will be sold at lower and lower prices. Better fracking technology lowers the production cost of oil and gas.   And increases the amount of natural gas produced and lowers the price.  Thats why SWN is so cheap.  A lot of knowledgable investors question whether SWN will be able to make any money as gas prices go lower and lower.,
"A quick reminder of the real facts concerning CHK and SWN... On 10/16/2014 SWN announced they would purchase ALL of CHK's properties and wells in West Virginia and included Washington County, PA. It closed in December of 2014; 413K net acres for just shy of $5Bn.  A pretty big deal, a somewhat high price, but it also occurred at the time of the greatest downturn in oil and gas most have ever seen. Rather than perform a costly due diligence, SWN took a limited warranty of title for these lands. Now I live here in Bugtussle, and I realize it's just 'fly-over' ground to most of you folks, but I need go no further than my property line to see vast title failure.  This includes paying the incorrect people royalties and lease extension payments. I conservatively put this failure rate at 20-25%. No problem right? After all they have the warranty of CHK... Now what do you think that's worth?  The combined market cap of these companies will barely approach $5Bn. Wake up folks; if you just want to throw your money away, throw some of it my way... been a cold winter here.",

"A typical review conclusion is: ""The 11 CUs of the 2400G perform at the same level or slightly better than a GTX 1030""Hmmm. The 1030 must be a pretty bad processor.Its more correct, and therefore helpful for debate, to say each similar specced gpu will have performance advantages and disadvantages in different situations. When graphics tasks are confined to interlinks between faster gpu cache (once loaded) and the gpu, via the much faster gpu's bus, the discrete card should have a big advantage. In all other situations (where the gpu interconnects with the rest of the system via the pcie bus), the apu should have many advantages over discrete.Meaning, an apu with its own hbm2 cache (as seems certain to come), stomps on an equivalent gpu card.  The apuS win easily on latency and bandwidth. The Never has there been such power, miniaturisation and integration on a SOC before. AMDs penultimate goal has at last been realised - a released zen/vega apu.They finally have brought their dual processor advantage to bear on their rival, and it is a super weapon. The price/performance/simp... advantages of an all in one APU is almost irresistible to millions. You get a fair priced 4C/8T cpu, and they include great graphics ~free.I never thought i would say it, but I almost feel for Intel & the livelihoods it generates. Even when they have an isolated win, like the new $375 8700k, their margins have been decimated by zen, and intel has grown accustomed to fat marginsI see the zen/vega Apu as an ubiquitous platform, which brings further strength to the platform.As code devs orient code to the strengths of the apu'S platform, the advantages of discrete cards will pale.The focus, as suits amd & nvidia, is on the inarguable advantages of discrete cached gpuS, and too little on the less obvious and immediate advantages of apuS.",

The rich intel investors don’t need to worry even if AMD doubles its market share. Because it’s a lot smaller it has a lot more room to move.,
"Everybody except AMD refers to the Ryzen mobiles as APUs, but I suspect they are not. The A series were single die creations have CPU and GPU features. These chips have the CPU and GPU melded using Infinity Fabric. I suspect the APU technology have a much higher expense/performance ratio and so AMD has chosen to use to meld the separate chips into one as they do Threadripper and EPYC. The CPU and GPU are probably produced on separate wavers and put together much the same as Intel is now doing with the GPUs they are getting from Intel except their fusing of the chips is not as advanced as AMDs.In fact, a year ago when Ryzen and Infinity Fabric were introduced I thought they could use this technology to integrate graphic chips to the CPU, but of course that would be ridiculous for AMD to do, since they made APUs. But the IF technology could also be use to meld other types of die to the CPU such as a memory module or a modem chip (could this be the idea behind the Qualcomm deal?).",

another hit piece out today,
"They will ALL definitely look at the totality of OS + other CIs (consistency and correlations) but no other 100%  population like this has been tested comparatively. That is, jak contaminated or never responding to jak and in such late stage terminal status. We are not privy to so many variables that any math almost seems pointless IMO other than basic month counting based on dates we know about. The Anderson study is not clear either for comparing Apples to Apples.Sometimes simple is better. The only MF R/R  drug, jakafi,  fails; nothing else is available; What is the jakafi baseline for determining failure in MF ? Have we ever heard of one ? That should be our comparison but I doubt we have consistency in the patient population entering IMBARK meaning did all patients enter with the same determination of jakafi failure ?Regardless, if IMET gets significant enough of a total score in OS + CI's, that's better than nothing but what is significant enough ? The total score is determined by who ? The FDA ?",
The problem is that there are many ways to do the math such as applying expected value and actual valuations to assigned weighting of the various CIs plus an OS weighting and deriving an outcome total requirement. What will FDA use ? What is customary ? The only comparative barometer is jakafi doesn't work and has a value of zero. IMET is additive value = better than nothing in R/R MF (we hope and think). The question is what value will be assigned to IMET by the FDA.,
"I believe there is a way to show statistically significant OS without a control group. It requires a sufficiently high number of patients survive at 18 months. Under this scenario, there is a reasonable mathematical claim that OS is statistically significant.Here is the general idea (somewhat mathy):- We can consider Imetelstat treated OS at 18 months in the general population to be a Bernoulli variable with unknown success (i.e. survival) probability (USP18). The IMBARK clinical trial can be seen as a sample drawn from this distribution in order to estimate USP18.- In simpler terms, USP18 is the unknown probability of Heads (Heads = survival greater than 18 months) of a biased coin. We toss this coin multiple times (as many patients as there are in the clinical trial) and based on the results estimate the true probability of coin coming up Heads.- If we can show that  USP18 is more than 50% with high probability, then we can claim that median OS in the population is at least 18 months with high probability. Note that 18 months is better than Standard of Care and I assume sufficient for BTD designation.- We can then use Hoeffding bound to estimate USP18 based on 18-month survival in the clinical trial.- In order to claim with 95% probability (P <= 0.05) that USP18 is 50%+, a sample of X patients needs to have no more than Y deaths within 18 months. The values of X and Y are shown below for various values:X, Y60 20 --> meaning no more than 20 deaths out of 60 patient sample at 18 months.70 2480 2990 33100 37110 42120 46130 51140 55150 60160 64The formula is ROUNDDOWN(X*(0.5 - SQRT( -1 * ln(1 - C) / 2 / X ) ) ) where C = 0.95.Just for fun, if you wanted 99% confidence (P<=0.01),X Y60 1870 2280 2690 30100 34110 39120 43130 47140 52150 56160 60",
"Using OS can be particularly difficult for new therapies in hematologic malignancies (HMs). The information listed under Results is particularly interesting. -Sargasso2017 May 15Meaningful endpoints for therapies approved for hematologic malignancies.Smith BD1, DeZern AE1, Bastian AW2, Durie BGM3.AbstractBACKGROUND:Overall survival (OS) is considered the gold standard for determining treatment efficacy in oncology trials, but the relation between treatment and OS can be challenging to assess because of long study durations and the impact of subsequent therapies on outcome. Using OS can be particularly difficult for new therapies in hematologic malignancies (HMs).METHODS:This retrospective analysis was conducted to characterize the primary endpoints used to support US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for new drug or novel HM indications between January 2002 and July 2015. Data on approvals were retrieved from the FDA and CenterWatch websites, and from the FDA prescribing information on respective products at the time of approval.RESULTS:Sixty-three FDA approvals involving 35 drugs and 16 HMs were identified. Of the 63 approvals, 45 (71.4%) included response rate (RR), and 17 (27%) included progression-free survival (PFS; n = 14) or time to progression (n = 3), and 1 approval included OS. Twenty-three approvals (36.5%) included trials with an active comparator arm. The median relative magnitude of benefit versus comparator was 71% improvement (range, 26%-127%), with a median hazard ratio of 0.55 (range, 0.16-0.72).CONCLUSIONS:FDA approvals for new drug or novel HM indications are often based on endpoints other than OS, such as RR and PFS. Tools for determining the magnitude of clinical benefit and treatment value in HMs should take into account the importance of RR, PFS, and other non-OS endpoints.

"""When the FDA is really concerned, they shut down your trial and then ask for more information.""The above line was a great observation & comment in my opinion, and it's certainly how the prior FDA clinical hold of Imetelstat played out.  In addition to your above comment, I hope Alpha Exposure (Mangrove) & AF noticed there was no reference to any drug-related patient deaths in the recent MDS poster (link below).   As I recall, the deaths in the Mayo pilot study were in patients who had been dosed weekly at the 9.4mg/kg level.   They abandoned the weekly dosing during the pilot study, and they now appear to have good protocols in place for both dose reductions & escalations based on patient blood work & responses.....see evidence of their MDS dose reduction protocols in Fig. 3 (link below).http://bit.ly/2jQ7rL6NOTE:  It's also in Figure 3 you will see evidence of the 4.7mg/kg dose being utilized in the IMerge MDS trial.  This particular patient received four (4) separate doses at the 4.7mg/kg level.....long after the 4.7mg/kg dose had been discontinued in the IMbark trial.",
"Dr. Hartman, I interpreted the comments as A) some of the 4.7mg/kg patients 'elected' not to crossover to the higher dose, and B) the potential survival benefits are being observed across both Arms of the trial.   I'm hopeful IMbark's observed clinical benefits and potential survival benefits will extend to those patients who elected to stay at the 4.7mg/kg dose.  This may only be wishful thinking on my part, but Dr. Scarlett's comments seem to allow for this possibility.   This scenario is also supported by two other pieces of information made known to us:  1) We haven't hit median survival in the lower dose Arm, and 2) The 4.7mg/kg dose is being utilized in the MDS trial as can be seen in the ASH poster.   With the benefit of hindsight, I wonder if they prematurely terminated the 4.7mg/kg dose based primarily on the dose's inability to achieve >35% spleen responses (in a very sick patient population) within a 12-week treatment period.   With the termination being based on a primary objective measure (i.e. spleen response) that we now believe is not highly correlated with patient survival.FYI....I agree with Wiz's statement above.   All of the 4.7mg patients had the ability to crossover, and the groups are being tracked separately.   Based on Dr. Scarlett's comment, there will be three (3) separate groups tracked.....1) Those who started at 9.4mg/kg, 2) Those who started at 4.7mg/kg and elected to crossover to 9.4mg/kg, and 3) Those who started at 4.7mg/kg and elected to remain at the 4.7mg/kg dose.Thank you (again) for the article, and thanks for your consideration of my question.",
Huh ?The 4.7 patients were allowed to to be tracked separately and convert over to the 9.4 doseage. The pure 9.4 ARM doseage patients are tracked separately from any 4.7 conversions to 9.4.Any 4.7 patients never converting to 9.4 doseage would simply provide additional data like survival. 4.7 patients that never converted were either by choice or deemed not capable of handling the higher doseage or possibly other unknown reasons.,
"Dr. Hartman,At the 33:20 mark of the recent Stifel conference, Dr. Scarlett stated some of the 4.7mg patients did NOT move to the higher 9.4mg dose.  A few moments later, at the 33:45 mark, he stated from a survival prospective we should think about anybody who got Imetelstat. I would appreciate your thoughts and/or interpretations of these two comments.   Thank you for the recent article....much appreciated.",

"Finally, here’s one more thing I don’t know:How does one make any realistic revenue projections for GERN when one does not have the answers to such basic questions? (IF there are more basic questions about GERN I’m unaware as to what they may be.)The answer to this question is one makes certain assumptions about Imet and then certain revenue projections based upon the present MF and MDS markets. Simple. I get that. But it’s at least somewhat interesting to note that without answers to these fundamental questions one has little idea if one’s assumptions are correct.Black box investing. Give us your money. Trust us. We will inform you when we feel like it and not before. End of story.PS. Is it any wonder why the price of GERN is so low? Lack of basic information = fundamental uncertainty = lack of confidence = a low stock price. (I think Einstein first came up with this brilliant formula. I'm just borrowing it.)-	Sargasso",
"Earlier didn't comment on the Celgene argument.  GERN has absolutely nothing in common with Celgene as a company.  The products that involve the same same diseases are also not apples to apples comparisons.  So while the comparison is useful in revealing how much $$ are at stake, and revealing how desperately needed these treatments are... it serves no other useful purpose.  GERN nor JNJ is going to put Celgene under.  And whether GERN becomes a blockbuster arm of JNJ or withers on the vine also has nothing to do with Celgene.  That kind of thinking is more befitting of NCAA speculation.",
The more I think about Anna’s emails the more I think she was informing investors to dampen their expectations of the first quarter review of the MF trial. It seems to me she was also expressing considerable caution with regard to OS. (I do not know what other conclusion to draw from her emails. I assume she was conveying a message. I also assume she was aware she was conveying a message.)So what I wish to know is: what is the future of GERN if there is no conditional or accelerated approval of MF? What then is the plan for MDS?These questions could not be more basic. It’s unfortunate that investors are still operating in the dark with regard to such fundamental issues.-	Sargasso,

good article.  thanks.,
I think I'll write an SA article spewing how GERN will shoot triple digits this month. That ought to flush the toilet. Fair is Fair right ?,
"Thanks for the actual piece of journalism which is so rare these days.  Essentially you have demonstrated that half-truths are not truth at all. There are additional points that could be made regarding the 2 articles. For example, there is not likely to be any immediate riches to be made in GERN. Success, as time passes and good news mounts, like the Fast Track that you did not mention, the price will rise. (and btw, the longer the current trials go on, the longer the survival midpoints and therefore immense increased value would be demonstrated).  Whereas, failure on the other hand, especially of the type AlphaExposure has put forth in near propaganda fashion, likely has already passed.   The data could of course not merit further investigation, but the enrollees are not dropping like flies, that would have ended things a while ago.   At the same time, the outlook at JNJ appears to be quite the opposite.  That is not to say that Shorts can't play games like this and scare people out long positions so the Shorts can cover... it happens daily.   It is very reminiscent of Saturday Morning Cartoons a few decades ago.  EVERY episode of Scooby Doo was about someone like AlphaExposure trying to SCARE someone else out of their property, so it could be snatched out from under them.  In most scenarios Shorts need to cover at some point.  Which is quite a bit different than the options that a Long faces.  A long can just wait... a long long time.  A long can wait for spikes and take profits.  But a short in this kind of scenario can only wait so long.  At some point, either they are in the black... or they they start bleeding red.  Positive results and success means that they must cover or risk losing and tying up far more money.  The longs time horizon could be 20+ years.  Whereas the shorts who shorted at these levels, may only have a matter of months left.  So the desperation is a factor.   There is a point where institutional owners dramatically increase their stake, longs add to their positions, and panicked shorts try to cover.  The psychology behind all of that is why chart patterns look the way that they do.  Each time, the price trends up, the shorts will come out of the woodwork trying to cause a panic in longs... when really it's an indication of their own panic.  Desperate shorts (or longs for that matter) will start stretching the truth and will become all emotional about their position.     So, to me the articles are in no way equal.  One is sound, with a case based on facts, and perhaps some element of enthusiasm.  While the other, is rooted in mythology (The past does not equal the future).  Both may impact prices... because emotions drive markets.  However, eventually the facts prevail.  Hype (negative or positive) only lasts so long.  An 80% downside seems to be ridiculously hopefully with no basis in reality at all. Short interest is already at nearly 21% of the float.  That's an exceedingly high level.  Positive news will cause quite the exodus.  While seriously negative news appears quite substantially baked in.  Every month that passes looks worse for the shorts.  It seems no wonder they would feel desperation when the prices goes up 40% such that they point to events a few years ago that have no relationship to current trials.  That smacks of outright deception and desperation.  And that is a clue that they are wrong.  Smart shorts came in early and at much higher prices, and have been covering on the lows.  The novice shorts arrived late, shorted near the bottom, and spew bs to try to make their position profitable.",

"Robert - I like this company too - I wrote about it on Seeking Alpha several months ago - and I agree the market over-reacted when it dropped the stock to just above 6.  Your comments on the acquisitions, tax rate, and management are all valid.  My only criticism (take it for what it's worth) is your terminal value multiple in your cash flow multiple.  I don't think a small, no-growth consumer products company sells for 15x FCF.  Historically, CRWS has traded at a single digit multiple of FCF, and my investment banker friends say a company like this would sell for 6-6.5x EBITDA, which implies an enterprise value of $60-65 million, or about $6.50/shr.  By my calculations, CRWS' median EV/FCF multiple has been 7.24x over the past ten years.  If you re-run your model using a 7-7.5 terminal value multiple, I believe you will continue to find a nice, well-run micro-cap, but I don't think you will see a 100% upside.

"Nice article. I have been following stocks like LITE, OCLR, AAOI and FNSR. The problem I see with china is that the government ordered purchases of new equipment to drastically be ratcheted down with the excuse it wanted to wait until new  optical standards were formulated going forward. I take that to mean they want to wait until their own optical companies can catch up to current suppliers before any increased demand takes place. The last earnings calls for OCLR, IIVI and LITE pretty much confirmed any significant demand uptick in the 2H 2018 wont happen.

Why do these financial companies like Bank of America give buy rating then on this stock when they know about the rate hikes coming?,
"These are good points particularly surrounding NIM compression and should be monitored. But this compression is less of a concern so long as NYCB can grow its book. When you have an asset ceiling and your liabilities re-price, then compression causes a severe erosion of earnings. The ability to grow your book, however, still allows a bank to grow its earnings albeit at lower margins. Not to mention that NYCB has cost savings coming from its expense rationalization as well as USD 1.5bn to deploy towards loans where rates have already been rising. This management team has been through many cycles and facing down a rising rate environment is no different than the previous cycles when its happened.",

Well since then, the 4th quarter results came out and they were fine, the stock has gone up almost 10% in less than 2 months.  This bank has one of the lowest P/E ratios in the business and the best efficiency ratio for a bank.  The lifting of SIFI regulations will give it the green light to grow again.

Last time I purchased HBI under $20 I was able to make 20%+ profit very quickly. I would not short this stock at this point unless new information. The stock appears to have very strong support at $19 which it tested multiple time already since a year. Shorting at $24 maybe but that is 20%+ above current price.If anything I ended up reading your article because I am looking to go long HBI near multi year lows and a nice 3%+ divi in case I get stuck with it.PS: I do not invest this way with my long term accounts (401ks 529s....),
Tangible vs. intangible assets? I don't care.I went long expecting management to continue to make sensible acquisitions. Is there a risk of overpaying for an acquisition? Dah.But calculating the enterprise value is irrelevant unless you are contemplating an asset sale.Not likely!,
Added more shares to my long position this month.,
Are you still confident in your short thesis after the past few days? I dont see how HBI wont be back to the $23 area before the next earnings report.,
"Having a negative TANGIBLE net worth does not bother me. When you make an acquisition, you're buying a company's ability to earn an excessive return on capital, therefore you should have to pay more than book value for it. How many firms sell for only book value? Hardly any. So almost all acquisitions create intangible assets. GAAP accounting does not allow you to write the value of the assets up to reflect the excessive rates of return",
"I am always amused when non-accountants allege accounting irregularities in a very large and complex global company which consists of the consolidation of dozens of entities. I don't understand something, therefore fraud.How much do you know about consolidating foreign entities? Can you explain to me the various methods available and how those methods affect balance sheet presentation? Here's a hint: exchange rates matter.The valuation cannot be taken seriously.Finally, tangible book value is completely irrelevant.",
"thanks for the article.  Agree it was not a great quarter.I will leave the dividend discount capitalization stuff - its been addressed elsewhere.Regarding inventory - they explained quite a bit of this on the call didnt they?  It is a risk, but when you say ""take down"" inventory by $500mn, how does that lower the value?  You are assuming that they will have an obsolescence charge of 40% of inventory?I see higher inventory and think, hhmmm, might they be able to generate quite a bit of additional cash liquidating it?Overall, their strategy seems to me like it makes sense and that several deals they have done have been good.  There is a non-zero risk that some of their brands may become less attractive, in which case, you do have significant risk of impairment, given that their assets are largely intangible.  On the other hand, it is often the intangible assets that are truly valuable.Given the generally good execution and sensible industrial logic, I think that a bit of forbearance is warranted.",
"I pulled up the most recent 10-k and viewed the tabular YoY Intangible assets footnote, which clearly shows the components of the balance for 2017 and 2016.   Where specifically are you charging HBI with accounting irregularities with respect to the identifiable intangible assets?",

HBI is an easy buy at these levels.  Looking at a FastGraph shows the undervaluation.  You short and pay the 3% dividend and I’ll go long and collect that dividend and see you back here in 3 years to see who’s laughing then.,
Great articles... Great numbers analysis....well written.... All true..... costs are great when building a future...   So what have they built?   Take a step back and take in the wider angle tell me what you see in comparison to any compitition..  What comes in focus is a global brand marketing machine capable of swallowing up market share by penetrating with a vertically integrated self reliant independant manufacturing machine that adds value by offering higher profit margins and the nimbleness to offer flexibility to match in real time the needs of  an ever changing market.  or  Complete Vertical Integration.  Add to that a vertual army of name brands that offer something for every nitch...A Machine with Flexability that can compete in any market to gain market share over any competitor.  look around.. they are at least years ahead of any compitition on the horizon....  they own their future.    I like what I see.,
Calculating enterprise value by dividing net income by (cost of capital less growth) is wrong math,
"HBI has realized all of its growth from acquisitions paid for with debt.  It has not demonstrated an ability to produce organic growth over time.  From 2010 to 2016 HBI purchased companies with annual sales totaling $1.94 billion (source HBI 10Ks and press releases during the year of acquisition of each company).  HBI 2010 reported sales were $4.326 billion.  Subtract the $0.36B recorded in 2010 from the Gear for Sports acquisition, leaves a core business base of $4.29B.  In 2016 HBI reported sales of $6.028 billion.  Subtract the $1.94B sales attributable to the acquisitions (note these sales assume no sales growth from the acquisitions over time) leaves a net core base of $4.087B for 2016, a decline of $200 million from the core business contribution of $4.29B in 2010.  From 2010 to 2016 HBI increased its long term debt from $1.99B to $3.5B in order to fund its acquisitions.HBI management recognizes it has an organic growth problem.  In recent quarterly calls management made a point of pointing to two quarters of organic sales growth in 2017.  However, two quarters of plus organic sales does not constitute a trend after 6 years of negative organic sales.  HBI's strongest core business is its highly profitable men's underwear product line which holds a leading market share position in the US.  This month Gildan announced it will be selling its men's underwear line on Amazon.  Hanes and Gildan have a past history of Gildan attacking a core HBI business.  In the 1980's and 1990's Hanes became the leader in the screen print T-shirt business building on its popular ""Beefy T"" sold to screen printers.  Gildan became extremely aggressive in the screen print business in the 1990's, and became the industry leader by the early 2000's largely through undercutting HBI on price.  In May 2012 HBI announced it was exiting its European screen print business and several segments of the US screen print business resulting in pretax charges of approximately $90 million.  Today Gildan has the men's underwear business in its focus as evidenced by its venture with Amazon and achieving distribution of its underwear program at HBI's largest customer -- Wal-Mart.Investors should be asking -- 1)  Does HBI really have a strategy to grow its business organically or will it continue to buy sales through acquisition with debt?2)  Does HBI have a plan to defend its core underwear business from Gildan and other emerging competitors, such as Tommy John, Duluth Trading, Mack Weldon, etc who are leveraging e-commerce effectively to gain awareness and grow market share?3)  Does Hanes have a viable e-commerce strategy and if so, why isn't it allowing the company to realize organic growth?",

It costs between $1,000 and $3,000 to mine bitcoin depending on electricity cost and equipment you use.     2. Long term there are much better coins than bitcoin and it uses way to much electricity to make it a viable long term project.I would add the following to Amazon:     1. Amazon should make about 40% profit margin on 100 billion in high margin sales and make about 7.5% on 400 billion sales in lower margin sales in five years this results in  70 billion before taxes taxes 20% or 56 million in profit divided by 500 million shares or about 110 dollars per share at 40 to 70 times earnings or $4,400 to $7,000 per share.",
"It is not economically efficient to ship goods in thousands of small packages, rather than to bulk ship large quantities to centralized locations for distribution to customers.  It is fast and convenient and reasonable for small, high priced items, but not for low cost, heavy, everyday commodities.  I don't see Amazon shipping potatoes, for example, where 10 lbs of spuds costs $2 and it costs $20 to ship them.  So, there will always be a place for the local grocery.  At the moment, Amazon is enjoying preferential pricing on shipping while all the rest of us have to over-pay for shipping so the carriers don't go bankrupt. They ship something like 40% of the volume at 10% of the cost, which is a grossly unfair subsidy.  I don't see this situation as sustainable, so when the carriers finally wise up, Amazon will get its wings clipped.  And, all that bull about drone delivery is just an attempt by Amazon to keep the carriers under their thumb.  Smart retailers like Walmart that can live on high volume and small mark-ups will continue to thrive.  Amazon is not even profitable on all the stuff it sells, but sells almost at cost, like Standard Oil did many years ago in order to put the competition out of business.  If they raise prices to be profitable and have to pay fair shipping rates, then they would lose a lot of their competitive advantage.  That would let some of the air out of their bubble valuation.",
You are missing the logarithmic graph of paypal. Where is it?,

Amazon will be broken up just like AT&T.......,
When PayPal hits 100$ sell it and wait for the “correction”,
“Amazon grows harmoniously within the framework of its long-term growth rate.”This analysis looks wrong to me. Exponential curves in general stay at a low value in the y-direction. They only blow up (in the y-direction)over the last few x values depending on the coefficients. PayPal and Amazon will have different coefficients. Amazon was not firing on all cylinders for many years. PayPal seems to be a better job of that given they are a younger company.,

I think if Paypal stock price were to stagnate for a year or so, it would be a very reasonably valued growth stock. If something is a real bubble, meaning it exists in the psychological territory of irrational hype and outlandish expectations, it can't come down to earth in a similar, controlled fashion. It will burst and the illusion hits a wall, changing the entire perception.",

"@Thomas Pangia. Thanks for another interesting IBM article that provides food for thought as have your other IBM articles.I thought the debt graphs were informative as other commenters have pointed out, but I did see a troubling trend in the Core Debt to Cash graph. From 2004 to 2012, cash exceeded core debt. However, starting in 2013, core debt has exceeded cash. During that time, core debt has grown, while cash has declined, until 2017 when cash had a yoy increase, though still less than core debt.Also, core debt has grown substantially over the past 9 years, from less than $4 Billion in 2009 to more than $15 Billion in 2017. During those same 9 years while core debt increased, cash was declining from $14 Billion in 2009 to less than $8 Billion in 2016, until finally rising to $12 Billion in 2017, which was still less than the 2017 core debt of over $15 Billion. Perhaps IBM has let core debt rise during this period because of low interest rates. It'll be interesting to see the core debt/cash figures going forward.",

"Attention all shoppers... 20% off sale on NILSY today. One important note: If USA does decide to impose sanctions on NILSY, then US investors will be forced to divest their shares in the firm. NILSY has not been directly targetted by USA in this latest round of sanctions, and I believe they won't be, for the important reason that Russia produces roughly a quarter of the world's supply of palladium. Palladium is crucial to the worldwide automotive sector. It is in deficit, and prices recently hit a 15 year high. Furthermore, NILSY has been making up for shortfalls by selling metal acquired from Russia's strategic reserve. If Russia chooses to stop depletion of the reserve, or even worse decides it wants to replenish the stockpile by buying part of NISLY's output, there's no limit to where palladium prices might head.As always, do your due diligence before investing.>>>One source of funding that’s likely to remain for Deripaska is the dividend flow from Rusal’s 28 percent stake in MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC, which is paid in rubles through a Russian depository.

"Analysts said some investors were spooked by the threat of litigation and fears that a renewed battle for control of the company could distract Mr Potanin, who is also chief executive with a hands-on role, while others thought he might seek to use a larger shareholding to reduce dividends and divert more cash flow to capital expenditures and new investments.“The move is apparently driven by [Mr] Potanin being supportive of a more balanced approach towards not only dividends, but with a proper focus on capex,” wrote BCS Capital Markets in a research note. “We see current weakness as not largely fundamentally driven, hence argue that the market seems to have overreacted to the newsflow, albeit the dynamic adds some volatility.”http://on.ft.com/2C4ASDN",

Most suffer from one or both of these issues:1)  Very thinly traded (some will go entire days with ZERO shares traded); and2)  Nickel is a very small percent of their business (like buying G.E. because they make light bulbs) (Example:  Freeport-McMoRan- the vast majority of their business is copper, gold and moly and in that order- I searched their entire annual report online and didn't even find the work nickel mentioned a single time- ouch!)Also, there is a nickel ETN with the symbol NINI (note that I said ETN instead of ETF), but it is very thinly traded so I have a hard time imagining how anyone could consider it to be anything other than a wild speculation.

Anyone in the U.S. who owned 999 shares or less of NILSY was virtually guaranteed that all shares submitted would be accepted.  Depending on what price you paid for the stock, anyone who bought on the news to play that tender (as I did) make approximately 60% profit in about a month.  It was well worth the risk IMHO.The generous dividend is mentioned quite a bit in the article.  Are there foreign taxes involved and what percentage is deducted from my U.S. brokerage account?All that said, the name is ""Norilsk""- it is not ""no risk"".  Am I afraid of this stock?

This article sums BX up perfectly the stock simply lags the market no matter what the PE or earnings arehttp://bit.ly/2FlOIzz,
"the 10 year trend line is quite clear, and if you were to buy now , there is a 89% chance you will make Cap money when looking at the 5 year statistics, projections . SO , the decision to buy NOW is academic. Yes of course ! Some people got caught and bought at 43 and don't want to wait for the recovery . I understand , but don't agree !  of you look at the 2, and 3 year graphs the recovery back to and up to 55 USD is well on its way ! Quality company that pays a Great Div at 85% of the profits each quarter .( I think its 85% , thats what stuck in my head from my last conversation with them )",
Correction...I meant April 2015 when the high was $ 43.57...,
About BX - mostly correct. But for those who may have bought in April 2017 at $ 43.57 are still underwater. Agree the dividend is very good and I enjoy seeing it. Let's hope the stock continues the upward trend now seen for the past few years since the peak in April 2015.You are seeing it correctly as well as the analyst rating and earnings should continue to propel it highr.

"long term hold and buying at the right times prove the best way to invest in BX ! Look at the long term chart... growth is evident .

The rest of the billions are sent back to the company for growth .  IF you look at the five  and TEN year graph , and follow the trend lines  in core SP -It quite evident you make money with this company ! Aprox 12.00/14.00 -  to 33.00 in 8 years folks !!  !

We sold ours and bought Hilton. So glad we did. We were with Blackstone for three years and lost 2000 dollars. No gains and every time they went up the big guys of the company took and sold their shares and became very wealthy. I became 2000 dollars poorer. Had to sell because I seen no kind of benefit in this kind of action by CEOs.,

"BX is a trading stock, not a long-term buy/hold.  What you omitted from your analysis is the ownership structure.  The common unitholders get what the senior partners pass down to them.Take the divs, sell covered calls (or sell the rips), sell puts (and/or buy the dips), and you can make a low double-digit return on BX.",
"BX has had trouble in recent years, but it's finally coming out of its doldrums. It's made a number of purchases in the last couple of years, and the earnings report was still good. Now is not the time to sell (for me), esp since I'm collecting over 7% in dividends. That sure helps when the stock price suffers. The dividend is variable, which irks me, but whatever. I'll see what the near future holds. I've made a below-market return because I bought when it was valued more highly. I bought down, which I hate to do. So I've ended up making a reasonable return, when you include the dividends. But I'm thinking I can possibly do better.",
"I'm with you Wall. I use covered calls to push the return with dividends up to 10%. I'm willing to wait, but the world-wide business environment isn't going to get any better than it is now. I think it's within the next 12 months or never for significant stock appreciation.",
"I have to agree with Bram De Haas. (Very cool name!)BX is not a blue chip dividend grower. (Like GE once was)But it sure doesn't seem the benefits of tax reform have been reflected in portfolio value. AUM did get nicked by the market 'correction'. But the economy is still accelerating, so I see no real problem here.  Management believes they can put great gobs of capital to work profitably. Something this team has a good long term record with. BX is ultra high BETA. The distribution is variable so the sweet $0.85 is unlikely to be repeat soon. Given the general market valuation, $33 seems a good relative value to me. BUt I was fortunate enough to buy a bunch after the President Trump was elected. For some reason I will never understand BX, just sat there waiting for me to really notice.  Best of fortune all.",
Insurance is Permanent Capital…  That is why Blackstone is thinking about Insurance…  That is the Genius of Berkshire Hathaway...,
Just took a position in my IRA. Hope it was a right move.,
"Glad to see the write up. Nice piece. Blackstone has been my largest holding since I bought it back in 2010 (About $8/shr)   It's been good to me. I think the dividend is completely sustainable and at the current yield, that alone makes it under valued. But the last 3 years have been a disappointing ride. I keep wondering when the market is going to show them some love.",
The BX story is so six years ago it isn't even funny - nowhere to go but down as the great cycle of de-risking takes hold and their AUM's fade to secular lows.,
Never underestimate the fear factor of a stampeding herd looking for yield and most importantly survival. AUM will continue to rise and their Moat is massive. You are correct with an undervalued call here. IMHO,
I am long but the stock does not perform as well as the regular market. When the market is up BX is up half as much.  When the market is down BX is down much worse usually. I am sure interest rates are also a drag on any high yield investment. Maybe the float is too large? I dont know but I am underwater here.,
Agree long BX,
Dividend of 10% coming on the 20th. Nice little bonus that keeps on giving.  I don’t mind the dividends fluctuating. Like the February dividend was a very nice “surprise.”  Not sure is interest rate worries are holding this down but business prospects are looking very favorable and the Saudi money should be sound put to work.  Love the management.,

If Juniper wants to survive will need to evolve and start thinking about recurrent revenue through subscription models and more diverse portfolio. That is what a lot of companies are doing today and Wall Street is looking at that as well. Too much competition on the Routing and Switching space is putting pressure on Juniper in the SP market with Huawei and Cisco.,
"For me, the recent dividend increase (now yielding 2.8%) and share buyback program do the trick.  Management suggested buying $750 million in just Q1, or 7.5% of market cap at current prices, with more to come later in the year.Also, after Nokia expressed interest last year, is there any reason why Cisco shouldn't buy these guys up?  Seems like it would highly accretive on a FCF yield, which Cisco management seems to value.",

"There's really a lot to digest here, and a lot of open ended questions. What is the development status of ASICs or other chips designed for mining? I see Antminer/Avalon, but what's the timeframe for these to really displace GPU sales or make them obsolete for mining certain cryptos? As for GPUs being dumped on the market, the other thing to consider is because gamers have been locked out of the GPU upgrade cycle for a year, there's a year's worth of pent-up demand for GPUs from gamers which will happily or unknowingly absorb used mining cards and the demand for new cards may not diminish much...While I see NVDA as a pumped up bandwagon stock, I still think they'll continue to blow past expectations and continue to 300.

I don't think this was addressed, and considering this isn't the first time I've heard this thesis, you might want to consider to what extent investors (not just investors who browse SA) are already expecting this rather obvious event. I think there's still room for the short thesis, but the market's smarter than you might suspect and you might not get the returns you expect.Also needing consideration, it's been two years since Pascal was launched, and by all rumors a new architecture is being launched this year. I suspect miners and gamers alike will pay a special premium to get their hands on it when its released. This special premium will offset the damage from a pascal crash.",

It pretty much has the AI market to itself and this market has incredible potential. I have no doubt more competition is coming. It remains to be seen how this all turns out. Nvidia however is a very strong contender and it won't let itself to be pushed out. Non-AI compute is also very strong and not many can threaten Nvidia there. In gaming Nvidia became the undisputed leader. AMD/ATI graphics have seen far better days before. Nvidia has a lot going for it. Nvidia(and AMD) could have gone a bit ahead of themselves thanks to crypto mining though.The question is can we model Nvidia revenue and profits if the crypto mining collapses?",

"Great article. I think people really fail to realize just how pervasive the crypto market truly is. A friend of mine works at microcenter and he gets asked 3-4x a DAY about discounts in buying more than 3 GPUs.

There is now a slew of DAG based criptos with IOTA and XRB being the most popular ones. IOTA team now has more than 50 researchers and the network is solidifying fast. Between that and ETH POS, mining will be made obsolete in 2 years, tops.",
"I don't understand most of the lingo here on bitcoin mining but I still have a question.  With all the emphasis on bitcoin and blockchain processing, does this imply, contrary to recent hoopla, that Nvidia is slacking off on its efforts in autonomous driving and that, therefore, outfits like Tesla find it necessary to go their own way?",
"CEO's last name is Huang.  Colette Kress did the earnings analysis and I don't remember any analyst asking what Nvidia's income from crypto was but my memory is not what it is used to be.

"I enjoyed this article and its thesis, but there's no way I'd short NVDA.  Over the long-term, I am bullish on NVDA.  Crypto could, at some point, present headwinds, but I'm unsure they'd be enough to overcome the general upward momentum of the company and the stock.If NVDA does correct due to crypto, I would be very tempted to buy the dip.",
"So Nvidia's warranty is for one year and only to the original owner. I would assume that crypto mining is very hard on those cards due to the always running and the heat that the cards put out. Do you know the failure rate of these cards over time? Also, if you are a gamer would you really want to buy a card that has been run in a crypto mining operation? Even if you could get a good price on it and it fails in 3 months you will be out that money. I think with the warranty alone I would stick with the new cards.http://bit.ly/2BsUz7h",
"Interesting thesis, but I am not going to short this one. The stock can have 20% corrections like happened twice in the past 3 months, or even bigger to 175 level, but difficult to time. I short good stocks like NVDA but only when I see a clear sell signal.",
Crypto mining is here and will be part of GPU landscape for both AMD and NVDA for the near future.  It will be lumpy growth and ASICs may opportunistically displace GPUs.

"True story, just this week a coworker went into a computer shop to get an upgrade for his graphics card. Three guys come in and buy six graphics cards for $6,500.

Small companies are vulnerable to a sudden and permanent loss of earnings.  If, in a recession, Roper must impair the large amount of goodwill it has, its debt to equity would soar possibly violating loan covenants.   Lots of debt and lots of goodwill can be a lethal combination.  A better idea for Roper would be to issue shares at the current elevated price and use that money to pay down debt.",

"Dave, very helpful perspective. Couple aspects perhaps mitigating concerns is the economies of scale of a large hospital group and their leverage in seeking price constraints and deals. But I think you are right that time will tell. For now, MPW is sliding down with the rest of the REITS along with DOC, which I also own. I'd be tempted to buy some more but remain disciplined in spreading my risk around, though right now everything REIT is either a buying opportunity or out-of-favor sector, take your pick. I am thinking  if trade wars and political turmoil sour the market and take the gloss off FANG, tech and growth stocks, perhaps REITS at the current level offering decent yields amidst high volatility might regain some appeal. When anyone who buys the S&P index can gain 25% a year, REITS might not seem like a deal. But when you suddenly realize you can lose 10%-20% or more a year, then things look a lot different!",
"The issue with MPW is that they made a large acquisition and equity raise about a year  ago while in the wake of the Adaptus issue which seemed likely to be dilutive due to a depressed stock price. They acquired several large struggling hospitals owned by a rapidly growing chain of hospitals which seemed very speculative.  The hospital group they bought from, Steward, was expanding rapidly (200% growth in 2017 alone) by buying poor-performing hospitals in low-income areas around the country and applying technological innovations to make the operations more efficient. It all sounded good, but in the wake of Adaptus's crash and burn, it made MPW's management look like they were prone to buying any growth story and were desperate to get the deal done.  While the proforma numbers for these hospitals was promising the idea that these hospitals could turn around profitability so quickly simply by hooking up video cams to monitor patient care seemed like a ""too good to be true"" fix for what has for years been an intractable problem in health care.  Furthermore the patients of these hospitals had a higher than normal amount of HC plans that were subsidized by the HCRA and other gov't programs.  With Trump and republicans looking for every way possible to starve the HC beast it seemed entirely possible that one of many things could go wrong with Steward on both the revenue and cost sides of the P&L and possibly on both.  On top of that these hospitals were in neighborhoods where new tenants could not be found quickly if the Steward crashed and burned like Adaptus.  In the case of Adaptus MPW's managment was always falling back on the story that even if Adaptus went under, the prime locations and newer construction of these mini emergency rooms could be rerented or sold quickly (which they ultimately were.)   This could NOT be said of the hospital acquisition, in fact the oposite was true, but rarely mentioned as a risk on calls.  MPW is being run more like a VC firm rather than a REIT using public money.  I assume Steward is hitting their numbers if the rent coverage stats in this post are true but that I wonder if Stewards numbers have been audited in light of the fact that Steward filed a suit against the state of MA to keep its finances private in Oct of 2017 ( http://bit.ly/2G58mEF )  Also bear in mind that Steward's competitors in all of their markets are primarily NFPs who often operate at a loss.   So if you believe Steward has found a way to walk across a minefield of regulations, while relying on revenue from communities that are being starved of healthcare dollars then you must believe that Stewart's management is truly ""disruptive"" in a way that can only be characterized as miraculous.   But as an owner of MPW one has to wonder why did MPW take such a risky bet, at a time when their stock price was so low when they undoubtedly will have plenty more opportunities to buy hospitals from Steward as they expand?  My only thought was that the Steward deal had been in the works for a while and promises had been made. Steward clearly needed a way to raise capital quickly after their acquisition of these struggling hospitals in order to invest in their cost-cutting technology, and likely no other REIT would buy into this deal. Steward could turn the HC market on its head and show everyone how it's done, or we could wake up tomorrow to hear that they have burned through their capital raised from the sale of  properties sold to MPW, did not find the savings that they had anticipated and are now forced to close a few of the poorer performing hospitals.   Take their West Monroe LA hospital which serves a community with an average household income that is about 33K per year compared to the 58K of the rest of the nation and if you are so inclined read some the recent reviews of this hospital on Google: http://bit.ly/2G3TsOS .  I am not sure if MPW owns this property but this gives you an idea of the asset you are buying with MPW.  Yes, Wal Mart built an empire by serving underserved communities and they crushed mom and pop operators who were vastly inefficient.  So if you think Steward is the WalMart of the HC industry then I admire your optimism, but if you are buying MPW because you think ""hospitals never go broke"" you need to imagine a hospital chain that is capable of growing 200% in a single year to become the largest private hospital owner in the US while turning HC delivery into a profit center in communities that are facing no growth in population, HC coverage or gov't money.",

It has now one of the strongest balance sheets and best FFO to dividend coverage in the health care REIT sector.  Long MPW again and holding.",
MPW Div increased from .24/q to .25q  after the bell.  Bea,
"With so many recent acquisitions, straight-line rent contributes about $0.24 of the $1.43 2018 FFO.  This is a greater proportion of FFO compared to many REITs, so one could argue that MPW should trade at a lower P/FFO multiple.  Also, MPW's balance sheet is somewhat more levered than many of the higher-quality REITs such as VTR or HCN, so once again, this argues for a lower multiple.I do agree that MPW is attractively priced, but I think it is a stretch to believe there is 50% upside.  Adjusting for the balance sheet and non-cash portion of their FFO from straight-line rent, $15 is my target.",

It makes me less concerned with rising interest rates and political healthcare wrangling here. Also own SNR for some time, but considering moving that into perhaps SBRA due to the concerns of whether SNR can continue to support their dividend at current levels. I see 2nd Market Capital has a position in SNR and wonder if you have an opinion on their current sustainability. Thanks again for the great piece! -Art",

I do own some VTR, but not much else in this realm.I need to see a jolt upward in the face of rising rates before I put much more in this area.",
"Dane, agree on your analysis and am encouraged by it. Only thing I don't agree on is the chance of the market waking up to MPW and boosting the multiple. Sentiment is very negative on REITS with interest rates and treasuries heading up, no matter all the stories saying that REITS do well and this downtrend is not supported by facts. MPW is a class act in a relatively safe sector, IMO, but I am not convinced investors will catch on anytime soon and boost the stock. It will take time. But an 8% yield that seems secure - for now - will keep me in the stock. What happens with Medicaid is what keeps me up at night. Having blown up the budget and debt for an unneeded tax giveaway, now GOP will target Medicaid for sure - already is.",
Dane thanks for your response and I think you did a good analysis in your article. I have been a long time believer and added another 25% today. Gregg thanks for your comment and I agree there is a good chance they will get an upgrade this year which should help the price considerably.

"MPW has made two forgivable mistakes. One, a big acquisition they needed to raise equity to finance, the market sniffed it out and the shares tanked. Two, another big acquisition that increased their tenant concentration and put their debt rating at risk.  Then there was the Adeptus insolvency. They worked their way out of that one just as they said they would. They are going to solve the tenant concentration issue with one or two big JV's.  That will also free up funds for more acquisitions. I also expect a distribution increase to .25 soon. This is an attractive entry point for any one not already in the stock.",

"Another great well laid out article... I like the int'l diversification and  only seems reasonable to use a higher FFO multiple for MPW as you point out.  Headline risk from this years budget battles, interest rates and inflation talk..no matter how insulated the co is on these issues..will keep pressure on the shares imo but an 8% yield seems a fair return in the meantime.   The ETFs and other fund selling makes it a tough climb for all reits until sentiment changes.. yield starved investors should help keep a floor under the shares at these levels.  Bea",

"We appreciate your conservatism but in this case IT IS WRONG. The stock is stupid cheap.It is also a major takeout candidate if they want to do that. All the other more highly valued LP's want to get into Quebec and there is a huge stock market valuation arbitrage opportunity to but Hydro so it would also every accretive!!! Six companies announced LOIs to supply the SAQ with recreational cannabis yesterday (Exhibit 1).  As expected, Hydropothecary received the largest allocation by far, at 20,000 kg. This is the largest cannabis supply agreement in history.  Hydropothecary’s share is 32% of the total LOIs announced (62,000 kg), and 67% larger than any other cannabis supply agreement ever signed.  We believe the 20,000 kg allocation is appropriate – when the company’s 250K sq. ft. expansion is complete by July 2018, management forecasts annual capacity of 25,000 kg (picture 20,000 kg going to the SAQ and 5,000 kg going to existing medical patients and/or other provinces). This is consistent with our estimate of 23,138 kg sold in FY2019 (year end July 2019 – i.e., first year of rec sales). We therefore see this event as significantly de-risking our forecast.  We view these as ‘starter numbers’ from the SAQ, and we suspect Hydropothecary’s allocation climbs significantly over time. For example, we highlight the fact that the four MOUs signed by New Brunswick totaled 15,500 kg for Year 1 (Quebec has 11x the population, but only secured 4x the cannabis initially). When its 1MM sq. ft. expansion is complete (expected at the end of this year), Hydropothecary estimates having total capacity of 108,000 kg.  Hydropothecary has higher revenue per gram than any of the “Big 5” LPs ($9.12), a lower cost per gram than any of the “Big 5” LPs ($0.89) and now has announced the largest cannabis supply agreement in history – effectively selling out its capacity for the next 12 months, with likely much more to come. That said, the company has a market cap of just $675MM, of which $259MM is cash ($114MM is free cash over and above growth capex). The company’s shares trade at an EV/2019E EBITDA multiple of just 6.9x and an EV/2020E EBITDA multiple of just 2.1x.  While up 6% in yesterday’s session, we were frankly expecting more. Given the disparity between Hydropothecary’s market cap and those of the “Big 5” LPs, with this development behind it, we believe Hydropothecary could be acquired by one of them.  We have made no changes to our estimates. We maintain our Buy recommendation and our $8.50 target price.",

"I think this area is one of the biggest long term growth themes; so we better make money in investing because a lot of jobs will be replaced by the technology that these ETF's represent.I think both ETF's are good because with ROBO you get the mid-caps and BOTZ has more large caps; it also adds the 3 sub-sectors which includes AI (NVDA).  The industrial companies in ROBO are due to the Automation products of the companies.  So between the 2 ETF's you get Robotics, AI, autonomous cars, drones and Automation with a good blend of the all the major companies in this space.  All these areas should experience high growth in the coming years.  If there is M&A activity the mid-caps will be the ones that are most likely bought and get the surge in price.ABB, Siemens and others in ROBO are there because of their automation control products which is the brains to most automated plants.I originally bought ROBO versus BOTZ because it traded enough volume to keep the bid/ask spreads small; BOTZ only traded <40K shares/day in Jan. 2017.  A $100K purchase would have been 20-25% of the day's trade in Jan. 2017. Now BOTZ trades with large volume without any negatives; so I started buying some yesterday (better late than never).Currently BOTZ is 9.07% NVDA but that amount will be reduced to <=8% in the June re-balancing.  (That is all I want since NVDA is the 3rd largest individual stock in my portfolio.)  From the prospectus: ""The aggregate weight of the top six securities is capped at 45%; and all remaining securities are capped at 4.75%.""The high concentration of securities is not a requirement for BOTZ.  The prospectus states: ""The top ‘pure-play’ robotics and AI companies by market capitalization will form the final portfolio. The index is capped at 100 companies. If fewer than 100 companies qualify to be eligible for inclusion, all these companies would be a part of the final portfolio.""  So the 29 stocks currently in the ETF constitute ALL the stocks that the index creator has determined fit the investment criteria,  If other companies are formed that derive a significant portion of income from the specified sectors and meet the other investment criteria; they will join the index and will be included in the ETF at the annual re-balancing.",

Not so clear that conventional Graham/Dodd applies in these situations, and thanks for trying.  For PCG, critical variables include a) outcome in the court appeal of the San Diego precedent, where CA PUC refused to acknowledge inverse condemnation, and b) ultimate liability for the horrible '17 wildfires.VFEA views probability as low that PG&E will prevail on both.  Final $$$ liability for the Butte fire in '15 only now shows a sense of closure in the next year, and scale/scope was far smaller than the '17 fires.  And, easy to view with high likelihood that CalFire will find some form of process failure that will trigger liability for '17, including pursuit of punitive damages.  Projecting further, settling those claims and lawsuits will require many years and billions of $$$.Common dividend at $1 billion annually, strong message from management, and easy to see that it will not get restored over an indefinite period of time.  Some good news, debt repayment schedule does not present big challenges. Next big headline:  CalFire report, VFEA imagines June/July this year.  Then, it could be a case of 'look out below' for share prices.  New issue will become whether PG&E can find liability insurance at any price.  Looking for additional insights in 4Q SEC 13F filings by Vanguard and BlackRock, biggest institutional holders.For F&F, far too many court cases to count at this point -- SCOTUS, Court of Federal Claims, several Federal appeals courts and district courts.  5th Amendment takings, nullification of preferred shareholders' contracts, breach of fiduciary trust, preemption of Virginia/Delaware law, violations of Administrative Procedures Act, Constitutional challenges for separation of powers and appointment clauses.  Not to mention absence of fixes from Congress or from Treasury/FHFA to resolve problems.  Sadly, and similar to California, the general pattern appears as taking whatever can be taken.Based on disclosure below, VFEA has clear conviction that courts will uphold rule of law and find (somewhere by some court) for F&F shareholders.  A total wipeout on all legal cases would suggest that darker days are ahead for the country.  No such view for PCG, given California social and cultural patterns since SB7 implementation in the early '90s, the state has embraced a path that forecloses an investment case for PCG.  In light of these comments, VFEA will examine a hedged short/put case in anticipation of the forthcoming CalFire report on the '17 wildfires. Thanks again for offering the ideas.

Technical analysis is another form of letting history determine our view of the present situation.  Used to be a devotee of technical analysis, but now not so much. Mike Cook of Zacks noted once that he – as a long-time trader – found that technical analysis worked less and less successfully as time went on. Perhaps it is because high-speed trading systems examine the same technical factors that human  technical traders do, but can react much faster, leaving humans with diminished returns,  or even  losses.

They recognized air freight costs related to the South Australia energy project in Q4 but are going to recognize the revenue in Q1. Pretty sure that’s not allowed under GAAP standards. You have to match the costs associated with the recognized revenue including costs associated with shipping the product. Even if you recognize revenue over time the costs have to be pro-rated at the same percentage or best estimate.,

"epeon:>>The Leaf has a superior interior. Really?It must show up better in person than in pictures because it looks really fussy to me.  It's also a good deal narrower than the Model 3.  I plan to check the Leaf out, so I'll know better then.  One good thing -- the Leaf is a hatchback, and that allows for both bigger and more cargo storage.  Nothing wrong with that.I was very pleased when I finally got to check out a Model 3 (but not drive it...sigh).  The interior looks much nicer in person than it does in pictures and is quite comfortable.",
"Here is my opinion on the electric car business:First, the business for most of its history has not made sense as a mass market product.  The cost has been too high and the infrastructure support too limited.Secondly, the cost was high because of battery cost.  However, we are seeing a steady decline on battery cost.  I saw an interesting article on this subject and if you plot battery cost against time starting in 2010 you see a steady 9.5% per year decrease.  GM said last year that their cost is $145/kwhr with LG Chem.  That would mean today it is about $132/kwhr.  If this continues, the electric car becomes a reasonable proposition.  My guess we would have to get near $90/kwhr with a 60 Kwhr battery.Thirdly, it really is a premium driving experience.  I drive a Bolt and it is very nice.  Quieter, more acceleration, very nice auto.  Recently drove a Leaf and, if anything, it is better.  My wife and I fight over who drives the electric car.  So, if you get a Leaf to about 200+ range it will really rock.Fourth, Tesla is falling behind.  The Leaf has a superior interior.  Fifth, I see a lot of investment in electric care infrastructure.  There will be a time when charging will be quite easy and there will be a lot of commercially available stations.  I was reading that we are seeing a 30% per year increase in charging stations.",

"The disclosure of the negative gross margin on the Model 3 project will continue at least through Q1 is interesting and optimistic.  A couple hours after that news release, many buyers in the Model 3 queue were given new forwarding of timelines with a changed order of production.  1st the Model 3LR up-trimmed, starting at $50k USD, with about a $55k ATP based on the 'used' market option levels.  Second was the Model 3 SR variant ($36k + options), and finally the AWD variant.  Now the new order is 3LR, AWD, SR for many orders.  The Model 3LRD (long range AWD) will most like have the highest ATP.It has been said automation issues with battery pack assy is the cause of the Model 3 delay.  However, by altering the order of variants, production could be boosted over 1/3rd without affecting gross margins:  Switch to Model 3SRD w/upscaled trim and Autopilot (the hardware is pre-installed).  Battery costs are still an issue, so using fewer per car improves margin, fewer batteries also increases weekly production.  A Model 3SRD optioned out would start at $46k, but use at least $4000 less batteries.  However, having the Autopilot as standard pays for equipment that is included already in the $50k 3LR version, but not paid for in the base price, then you will also have a minimum of 1/3 more cars for sale.  The customer sees a nice price drop, and quicker delivery schedule, while Tesla reduces unit production costs.Sounds sweet right?  Why aren't they doing it?  It certainly is not due to batteries unless Tesla Motors has no accountants on staff.  There are 2 possibilities:1)  The CEO is micromanaging the company in a way that harms it's best interests.2)  Or more likely, it's not the batteries, it's the losses being incurred on each delivery.  The car itself is costing more than anticipated to fabricate.  Cheaper batteries won't fix that cost.The slower than expected Model 3 sales perhaps are a cost cutting measure until they get the rolling chassis pricing down to the original expectations.I have a small long position on TSLA.",

"(Question for Bill Cunningham: if Tesla has booked its air-freight costs in Q4, but is waiting until Q1 to recognize the South Australia project results, does that mean the project results will not include those air-freight costs? Why the mismatch in timing here?)MS- I didn't see this right away. Sorry about being slow in responding.I'm NOT an accounting expert, so I can't give you a highfalutin'  answer.However, since I'm not an accounting expert, I can give you some feedback from a basic logic, rather than an accounting viewpoint. (sometimes, ""ignorance really is bliss"").I would think the cost of the air freight should show up as part of the cost of the batteries, and all costs and revenues should show up in the same period.(I.e. Q1 '18 since Tesla said that's when they will recognize the revenue)However, the accounting issue is minor; I'm baffled as to why Tesla is even mentioning it. How much is the revenue from this deal? I get the impression it's probably $50-100 million. How much do the batteries weigh? How much does air freight from Korea or Japan to Australia cost? I'm having trouble seeing how it could be material.I flew on United from NY to New Delhi a couple of years ago for about $1000 round trip (to the other side of the world.).  There were roughly 300 people in coach and and a few in business and first class who paid more. In any case, United probably collected $500,000- $1 million in revenue. The batteries probably weighed less than the people on the plane, went a much shorter distance, and only went one way. How much could it have cost? Why is Tesla even mentioning this issue?I'm sure someone can refine my math. Maybe the batteries weigh more than 350 people (even if most Indians are considerably more slender than me.)",

"Tesla, like all companies, uses the ""one-time charges"" to hide their real losses.  Calling their air freight costs to Australia a one time expense is just an accounting trick that Wall St. has come to accept as routine.  The first news article that I saw after Tesla reported its Q4 results said that Tesla beat expected earnings, EXCLUDING ONE-TIME CHARGES.  Guess what.  They reported, in real net loss, the biggest loss ever.  We should then ask Tesla this.  If Tesla can exclude its air freight costs to Australia as one-time costs in Q4, then will they exclude the revenue from the Australia in Q1 as ""one-time revenue""?  Not a chance.  So, for the same project, you gladly report the revenue as normal operating revenue, yet you exclude some of the costs as some sort of one-time charge.  Why the auditors would allow this is puzzling to me.",

"100,000 ""this year"".  However, look back at the prior take-or-pay contract from 14-17.  That was for only 70,000 cars per year (at 85kWh) - and so, the 100,000 per year is above the prior cell counts and should be cheaper to buy at such volume.  Maybe they wanted another 4-year commitment on those cells to get the best price and right now, 100,000 is ""possibly questionable"" and cannot go 4-years @ that number if new 2170 cells are to be used.  Or they feel that the stated 100,000 S/X in 2018 is at risk so don't commit to much more.  They already have committed to hiring levels at the Buffalo plant or they have a $41M per year fine to pay - I suppose that is ""force majeur'd out by now"" with the Trump machinations of the solar pv industry.Could it be that the 100,000 S+X sales number or in other words ""zero growth"" for 2018 is a realistic level and that 2017 may have had some interesting situations like Hong Kong going away and tying up perhaps ""some"" shell companies in holding inventory - and are there any other countries holding new inventory as ""new-used vehicles""?  That amount could styme sales going into 2018.  It's very translucent and this is how operations work there.  Just ask Jon McNeil - he's decided to leave the company and go work for a taxi service.

"18650 cells Tesla uses aren’t generic, they’re made to Tesla’s spec and only suited to go in Tesla’s battery packs because they leave features that otherwise would be in the cell to the pack. So Tesla can’t just go into some general market and buy more, they have to contract for custom production. While it’s in some sense correct that Tesla could order more, it would require long term commitment to a supply they probably don’t want. This isn’t an indication they’re limited by demand. If they wanted more demand they could take desperate measures like engaging in an obscure strategy called “advertising”.",

"The reason Tesla can't just swap in somebody else's 18650 cells is that it really WOULD require a lot of time and effort on Tesla's part.  Oh, and money.  Cells, other than Panasonic, would require revalidation of the entire pack assembly.   We're talking hot/cold weather testing, battery aging/cycling, charge/discharge testing, etc, etc.  Many of these items take a finite number of calendar days, so unless Tesla has done their homework ahead of time, this additional validation could take over a year.  This is just the testing of the physical batteries; subtle differences in chemistry and manufacturing could also require changes to charge/discharge algorithms and even affect the ultimate performance of the vehicle, including the EPA certified range.  This is time, money, and manpower that Tesla probably doesn't have to spare right now.",

"@MS,Thanks for another great article - I always enjoy the read.I can offer 2 possible reasons (although it may be neither) for the apparent mismatch between the inclusion of the delivery costs on the Australian storage project and the revenue recognition:1) Some companies include delivery costs as part of selling overhead rather than gross margin, in which case it would be correctly included in Q4. Although possible, I think this method is a stretch.2) If the total project has a negative gross margin, then under GAAP the entire gross loss must be included in the period in which the loss is identified, regardless of when the revenue is recognized.",

"To equate the long-term cost of buying and owning at Tesla Model 3 with that of a Toyota Camry, you have to guess almost everything right about the future and ignore or deny most of the present and past.  For starters, when might someone ordering an M3 today take delivery of it and for how much?  What assurance has any buyer of the M3's lasting enough years to recoup its excess price over the Camry in savings on fuel and service?  Based on the last three decades, which car is likely to run more dependably and have prompt, speedy, competent service always at hand?Even if electricity is cheap at home and ""free"" (or so promised) at charging stations, having to travel preset routes instead of driving where you prefer is an irritation and a waste of time.  We all know of the diminished range of BEVs in hill country or heat, rain, night, and cold.  The cost of these burdens vary from one person to the next and so are uncalculable, but none the less real. Although there is no way to guess the ultimate costs of an M3 v.

"It does seem that all the balls that Musk has been juggling are going to finally start dropping and coming down to earth.  As a human and only a wannabe Martian, there are real limits to Elon’s protean powers. As MS has repeatedly shown, in effect Elon takes from Peter to pay Paul.  Peter was an early $35,000 Model 3 claimant  hoping to be able to get a car without too many defects before the subsidies slacked off and the insurance costs rose while Paul was Australian politician. Feel free to substitute other names than these, as many others will work. Whose going to put a stop to this nonsense?  The FTC ignored Madoff for way too long. He produced steady-eddy returns so he must have known something.  He did know one thing: How to cheat. He knew how to string things out so everybody who was anybody wanted in on his magical understanding of financial markets.  It is not clear exactly how long Madoff operated his scheme but a good round number is a quarter of a century. But Elon surely is not a complete fraud as Madoff was. Elon invests in real things and creates real products like the Model 3. True enough, but the entry-level $35,000 version of the Model 3 isn’t yet available and who knows for sure when it will be. There is an opportunity cost for plunking down your deposit and having nothing to show for it. If roof falls in on Tesla, it may be totally lost just like the funds flowing to Madoff near the end of the run. But Bernie is stuck in a Federal penitentiary while Elon is going to outer space and hyperloop heaven. His lines will run at warp speed, or at least much faster than an old lady with a metal walker.

"Regardless of whatever hype is made of this turnaround, or of cloud, blockchain, AI, quantum computing, or any other new and exciting technology for that matter, the price of IBM stock will forever be judged by their perceived inability to capitalize on it.  For a variety of reasons that are at the same time fun and painful to discuss, IBM is no longer capable of translating technology (regardless of whether it owns related patents or other intellectual property), into tangible, sustainable and profitable revenue growth.  Period.  It long ago became a fat and ineffective bureaucracy consumed with greed.Warren Buffet was a victim of the hype.  His recent decision to dump IBM speaks volumes.",
"Thank you for the analysis.A couple of points:Patents -  IBM have been a Patent leader for over 20 years.  Unfortunately they have failed to capitalise on their brilliant researchers by developing successful products to build marketshare or create new markets.  In fact in the last few years they have got to the point of selling patents to prop up the revenues.Blockchain - Blockchain is not a differentiator.  the basic technology is open source and all the major players have large Blockchain projects.  It will be like the internet or mobile phones - a basic tool of business that is used by all.Enterprise Cloud - IBM is nowhere in Cloud.  it is not even being considered by most companies.  IBM have relabelled everything they sell as ""cloud"" to make the numbers look good.  On premise software sold in the traditional model with a One Time Licence Fee and ongoing Support is now ""hybrid cloud"" and counted toward cloud.  Apart from AWS from AMZN, Azure from MSFT and Google Cloud there is no-one with more than a few percentage points of the market.Revenues - Why do you think IBM will grow by 8%?  I would like to see a record of more than 4 quarters of growth at a sensible tax rate before I believe they can sustain growth in a very competitive market.IBM have been borrowing money to buy back shares and pay substantial dividends.  If Interest rates move upwards over the next few years it will be more expensive to maintain this strategy.  Without share buybacks and regular large dividends the share price will dive.Disclosure I worked at IBM for a number of years.  They were good to me.  There are a lot of good people at IBM still and in the IBM Alumni.  They have been badly let down by poor Executive leadership.  Unfortunately with a CEO who is also the Chairman of the Board their has been a lack of critical oversight.",

Berkshire at one time owned roughly 81 million IBM shares, for which it paid about $13.8 billion.Additional IBM sales by Berkshire may been have made between Jan 1, 2018 and today, but those are not required to be disclosed until the next 13F released by May 15, 2018.

Parameters such as capacity fade with cycle and calendar aging, as well as the DC impedance increase, were recorded as a function of different temperatures, storage and cycling conditions. It turned out that (i) capacity fade and (ii) the increase in DC impedance during cycle aging are predominantly driven by high temperatures rather than by the number of cycles. After 500 cycles at 25°C and 40°C, capacity fade is about 13%, whereas at 60°C the fade already reached 22%. The same trend is shown by the 46% (25°C), 60% (40°C) and 138% (60°C) increase in DC impedance observed after 500 cycles. During calendar aging capacity fade increases with increasing temperature and SOC, reaching its highest values at 80% SOC....""",

When a price is so cheap that also means the stock buyback will buy back more shares and have more meaning to their shareholders than if it traded at like a 50 p/e. So the low valuation is actually kind of a blessing. Especially in regards to the stock buyback. I think ichr has many years of incredible growth ahead of it and I see no reason to believe they will not execute and continue to rise revenue and eps at warp speed through capturing new business, expanding margins, new product mixes.

Then in the fall we saw more insider selling at prices well under what i thought was then a reasonable value and more aftermarket tape painting. The comments by management that they were not interested in buying , i thought was at a time when the stock was at like 25......three days later the stock went below a 21 handle......and i guess that what created the action to approve a buyback... these actions buy Francisco and management have created a stock that is inconceivably cheap  and is perhaps one of the cheapest peg ratio stocks i have ever seen, clearly  a great buying given the dynamic nature of their business .....Unfortunately the stock may never recover from the abuse it has received by sloppy underwriting, aftermarket tape painting , ill conceived insider selling and management who cant clearly articulate when and how their stock is mispriced.......Whats the likely hood that any stock gets meaningfully bought given managements conference call comments.... all this makes for a stock to trade at prices that are inconceivably cheap and will never garner any kind of premium to justify a reasonable selling price.

I wouldnt think that at this point in a companies existence a share buyback wouldn’t be a high priority.  Why would stating that the buy back wasn’t going to happen sink the price?  It obviously did.Very interesting that they changed their tune with the decrease in pps.  At least that shows that management is listening. But does it concern anyone that they were disconnected in the first place?  Maybe this isn’t a big issue to begin with.,

What they seemed to screw up on the M3 was not that the car was all that complicated but that the degree of automation of the build infrastructure seemed to be much more complicated than they counted on.If they get the M3 sorted out in production, they should have a very clear picture of what it takes to program the infrastructure to build the Y.  There will still be snags but they shouldn't underestimate the start by a year.  Elon has some egg on his face from this underestimation.  I personally didn't expect that they would be in volume production before last Dec.  But they seem to 6 months past that.  It's a black mark but certainly not fatal.The other aspect of the Y is that Tesla should have settled down with their suppliers and folks should have a better feel for volumes and schedules.

"While not Tesla related I will repeat what has come up with the car parts suppliers (machined and moulded parts) that we have interviewed, quoting one of them. ""Our biggest concern is that brand name car manufacturers end up in a situation where the customers don't want to buy their ICE vehicles anymore and instead will start waiting for their EVs. That can be a very sudden change triggered by any event, a new scandal, oil price hike, more cities or even countries announcing their ICE bans, etc. There is just no way those factories can switch to EV production and make money, and we are not in the position of extending credit to them. It's will be a very bad situation. And to make things worse EVs will enable car-sharing services that will further lower the need for people to own a car."" But another parts supplier said:""Don't get your hopes up for a lot of new EVs in the market, yes there might be a bunch of them coming out but none of them will be mass produced until 2022 except maybe Tesla. You think 1% share of total car sales will make much dent in the market? I'd say call me back when you produce 1 million of one of your EV models per year.""Those guys are quite pessimistic of how their car parts market will evolve. There are the ones who say there is not going to be EV market until 2025 and those that predict that 80% of the ICE factories will go out of business before 2025 because the EVs will totally disrupt the market.",

He was in the car business for a long time, yet, he could not keep DMC from going bankrupt after only 9,000 cars sold.Tesla had sold over 250,000 cars to date AND their Model 3 reservations are in the hundred thousands.John DeLorean couldn't do it yet he was in the car business.Heck, Mercedes-Benz invented the automobile yet they could not produce a 100% electric car capable of more than 100 mile range.Do you see a pattern here?Tesla can do what others can't.Indeed, it really boils down to Elon Musk - he can even do what NASA can't (reusable rockets that can land vertically on solid ground/platform AND do it for less).So, your financial analysis means nothing when applied to Tesla!",

Wow! I wonder if TESLA will take Anton's advice and just give up.,
Sacramento - that’s where I’d build the Model Y factory.   Midway between Reno and Fremont.   The biggest component is the battery pack so you want to have the factory near Reno.  Sacramento has ample labor and quick access to Pacific ports.   Also close enough for Tesla to manage from its HQ.  Plus the California State Government is friendly to Tesla.,
But flamethrowers!  Focus on the real bull news.,
Model Y can be developed and produced sometime after the new owners take over equity of the firm after the BK auction,
you missed one scenario. Tesla gets Fremont to 700k a year with around 100k to 200k being model y. two more factories one in China and Europe each doing around 350k to 400k.maybe they can buy a old closed factory like they did in Fremont. saving time on long lead items you should list closed manufacturinf sites.,

Living in the city, if I cared to drive a hybrid, the 2018 Camry would be a darn sight better choice than any BEV.

After all, the VW Beetle was popular for 40+ years, despite many variants.  The Toyota Corolla has a similar history.

"Thanks for the article.I have yet to listen to conference call, but does anyone have an idea what the other big game coming in FY '19 is?  It's described as a ""highly anticipated new title from one of 2K's biggest franchises""?  Do any of you gamers have an idea of what that might be -- obviously not GTA, since that is a Rockstar game.Also, with respect to the author's comments about missing EPS in Q3 2018 (and I assume he means the most recent fiscal quarter), TTWO actually beat on EPS.  The problem is that there are really three different EPS numbers.  First is true GAAP, which is generally ignored, and in FY Q3 was $.21.  Second is adjusted EPS, which takes out one time items, stock option expense, and generally assumes a 22% tax rate.  In FY Q3, adjusted EPS was $.23.  Finally, and this is what I believe the analysts' consensus are forecasting to, is adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of deferred revenue and associated costs (call it adjusted EPS ex deferrals).  TTWO does not publish this number, but is easily constructed from the data in the press release.  In FY Q3, this came out to $1.12, which beat consensus of $.99 by $.13.  Revenues excluding deferrals (what they refer to as Bookings) were $654M, missing consensus by about $10M.  Although the stock was down significantly, I think it wasn't the revenue miss, but the fact that the overall market was down (-1,000 on the Dow) and it was a good time as any to take gains, and likely more importantly, the fact that FY 2019 Bookings (revenues ex deferrals) guidance was $2.5B, which was below consensus of $2.9B.  But TTWO loves to under-promise and over-deliver, and at this valuation, it had better continue to do that.  In any event, their $2.5B bookings forecast for FY '19 may have been a lowball number, and even if it isn't, it still represents a 25% increase over their forecast for FY '18 bookings, which is $1.99B to $2.04B. I am long TTWO and ATVI.",

You can use real money to buy in game money for this or you can grind.Maybe you want to give it another try!",
No mention of a borderlands 3?  That series has a rabid cult following.,
"There's still huge room for growth. Take a look at micro-transactions, which is hugely profitable. TTWO makes just over 50% of its revenue from these micro-transactions, whereas ATVI and EA near 60%. TTWO also doesn't have much of a presence in the mobile gaming space, and recognizing this, they've acquired Social Point in 2017 to capture this market, meaning there's a lot of upside potential there as well assuming TTWO continues to output top-quality content.

"Enjoyed the article!COP is one Oil company that has completed a transition to successful operation in current Oil markets and pricing in my view. In 2017 I roughly bought COP below $50 and sold most of it around $60. A week or so ago I bought some back at $50.50.COP in my view is roughly a $55 value. I might put a forward 52 week range of $46-$68. Even a bear case where Oil falls back in a 2017 pattern, COP is a much better company than a year ago. In the next year Oil could do anything but I am more optimistic than some because of strong growing demand for Oil worldwide. I think it is fair to suggest 10%+ annual increases in the dividend over the next 5 years. At the 50% completion point of 1Q the pricing exceeds 4Q by a good margin. In short COP is profitable and growing from here on out.",

However, recently you have written 3 articles that are bullish on RDS, XOM and COP(and 1 fairly bullish on CVX at the right price), which has the feel that you are simply bullish on the oil sector in general.So the question is what differentiates an investment in any of these companies as they are all majors(with the exception of COP not having a downstream business anymore).

"KyleI disagree with your first bullet and agree with your second bullet.  TSMC does not compete against it's customers and it doesn't do research on AI, other than maybe implementation of a customer technology to improve foundry operations.  TSMC R&D is focused on providing the best transistors at the lowest cost for any and all customers.  The business 'moat' is the size and diversity of the customer base.  Apple essentially outgrew Samsung.  Only TSMC could provide the wafer volumes required by Apple on a leading edge node.  With TSMC's large customer base there is adequate wafer demand on the trailing edge to allow Apple to keep moving forward.  The capex requirements are so large that even Intel has moved from four to five years on equipment depreciation and slowed down node transitions.  Apple utilized the 20/16nm node for three years and has moved to the 10/7 nm node for probably three years if not four years.  Companies the size of Qualcomm and Apple can not move easily.  Essentially Qualcomm and Apple switched places between TSMC and Samsung in 2014 and 2015, with Qualcomm still having a significant residual business at TSMC.From the TSMC 2016 Annual report.  The largest company is now Apple and the second largest is Qualcomm (?).'TSMC’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 63% and 69% of net revenue in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The Company’s largest customer accounted for approximately 16% and 17% of net revenue in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The Company’s second largest customer accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of net revenue in 2015 and 2016, respectively.'In 2013 Qualcomm was at 22%.  From the 2015 Annual report;'Our largest customer accounted for 22%, 21% and 16% of our net revenue in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our second largest customer in 2015 accounted for 16% of our net revenue, with 9% and 1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.'Thanks for the article.",

"Beware of capex heavy industries, remember how many DRAM manufacturers there used to be 30 years ago -- most are out, some are dead.  At the end of the day, it's ROA that drives ROE.  I would rather be with the chip designers whose investment is mainly human capital.  As the specs get tighter, the re-investment cycle quickens as well.  If demand or price for the end products (eg, iPhone) slows/stagnates let alone drops, and the foundry is shoulder deep in building its next generation fab, good luck.",

WBA last price to buy Rad was somewhere between $6.50 to $7.00 per share before they withdrew their offer. Those numbers are what Walgreen's was willing to pay. I believe Standley and BOD paying off a big chunk of debt by June 2018 and with the 2500 stores Rite Aid still owns the value of the stock should be around $7.50 per share. The share price on the market only shows $2.11 per share as of this date. I believe that price is quite undervalued  at this time.,
long to 4th qt 2018,
Rite Aid stock will be worth $3.50 to $4.00 per share when all the stores due WBA are transferred and RAD  uses the $$ to pay off debt.  From that point it is up to John Standley and the BOD to move the company forward. In 2019 look for $5 per share.,

What type of earnings are expected after the WBA sales is completed?Eliminating  a large chunk of debt should push earnings nicely.My thinking is that a low P/E will get more investors attention.A 2 cent per quarter dividend would turn this into a 4% yielding stock and would cost around  $100 million annually.  It would boost the stock price and be manageable.  A dividend would give value back to the investors rather than waiting for management to destroy or steal it.The board and officers need to be replaced.

The drug purchase agreement garnered with the divestiture sale to WBA means RAD will not have to operate at a drug cost disadvantage and WBA and RAD may both actually improve their pricing structure from ABC. It also places RAD in discussion in the MCK boardroom as a defensive acquisition. A merger of the Rexall/RiteAid operations may protect MCK distribution channels  and deny ABC from any market share increases that could be realized with the WBA/RAD agreement. It will really suck to be a short on a $2 stock if the next quarter report shows signs of earnings growth as the store divestiture nears completion.",

Buying the stock at $2.00 and writing the January $2 calls for 50 cents provides a return of about 35% if the stock just sits there without rising or falling.  There are few places to get that sort of return with that limited amount of risk.  (Okay, I know some will think RAD is about to collapse, but that's just BS.

Author how can you claim to be long the stock writing the article you wrote?,
Long RAD...,
"I'm long a relatively small position on the hope of a buyout, hedged with $4 covered calls on most of the position to give me some breathing room.  Agree with the author that RAD has lots of problems.  But I wouldn't short it here.  It may well decline, but the decline will be slow and painful if it happens.  They are paying off all the debt due in the next couple of years with the WBA money, so it is unlikely there will be a liquidity crisis that would decimate the stock.  The cost of the short could outweigh the upside.Only the biggest players would risk $6-8 billion (debt + equity) to buy this and try to turn it around.  Too risky given all the issues, plus the industry headwinds that could easily block the exit door when one would have planned to sell.  The investment play is to risk $300-400 million to buy 15% of the company, oust the mgmt, and try to turn retail performance around...  downside is probably only $100-150 million, upside is much more likely including all kinds of special one-time payouts to activists if they hit certain targets (or manage to sell it).  But Standley set up a poison pill to prevent any such activists.Thus, we either have to depend on a historical operational disaster (Standley would have been one of the great financial magicians if the original deal with WBA had held, but that is water under the bridge) with a couple of new senior people to magically right the ship;  or RAD needs a strategic buyer.The other alternative is that they use some of the WBA money to buy back shares and crush the shorts;  not necessarily a long-term solution but certainly a path to bail out with a profit.",

I also like the fact that SJ is low-tech, although I imagine that is not a depiction it would choose for itself. My portfolio has the likes of Alphabet, Apple and AMD. It’s nice to have a counterbalance, an old school defensive stock with a solid customer base, reliable profit streams, stable cash flow and no need to chase technology.Yes, its businesses are cyclical, but SJ has managed a reasonably strong and consistent financial performance pretty much through all economic cycles.

"Sven,Have owned Tencent for over 5 year.  Enjoyed your video.  Though you mentioned investments in Tesla and Snap, believe you missed a Major potential factor.  GOING PUBLIC WITH COMPANIES TENCENT IS WHOLLY OR PART OWNERS WITH.  Last year they went public in Hong Kong with Yixin.  Price immediately soared.  What was the difference between the accounting for their before and after the offering?  As you should know, Tencent has about 100 other companies like Yixin.  They did say they were planning to take several public.  What will that do to their asset base?  Future earnings? I believe most of the companies they go public with will be on the Hong Kong exchange.  Your thoughts?",

"Good video thank you The largest % of my widely diversified portfolio is tencent. Being the facebook of China, its a buy and hold for the long term. Buy the dips and smile",
Enjoyed the video and excellent overview of Tencent. Totally agree this may be a good time to scale into a position for anyone wanting China exposure as markets likely will consolidate and perhaps retest the lows over the next weeks/months before resuming the bull train. I already have a full position since investing over a year ago and like Amazon and Facebook is a long term hold.,
"I expect that holding some of both Naspers and Tencent is less risky than holding just one. Sure, it's not like holding two unrelated stocks, but I am comparing it here to holding just one of these two.  I also hold several Chinese stock ETFs that hold Tencent, typically as their largest holding. Some also hold Naspers.",
Tencent loooooooong. 90% of facebooks money is ad driven. And with tencent I think I recall this being about 10-15% of total revenue. This is a huge difference and so much future growth potential for tencent. They know more about their users than Facebook knows about us.

Complete Mis information !  Re-direction of the Facts that are the Most important;  In this Article. The Elephant in the Room Is : CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY DO NOT HAVE ! ! ! GET IT ? ? ?No tech company survives with out it One simple concept ! ! !,
"One last time I state;  what should be obvious by all!Jvz post to Seeking Alpha.com Go-pro StoryAs an Audio Video Professional for almost 30 years my kids grew up around new technology. In January 2017 my kids living in New York decided they wanted to start a VR / 360 production company. My daughter 27 years old with a degree in film from UC Santa Cruz (a fairly renowned film program) had directed and produced a short movie submitted and shown at several film festivals including consideration at the Sundance Film Festival. My son 20 a male model represented by New York Models agency and a relative new technology maverick, has and is shooting VR videos of fashion week in Paris. Including the upcoming one in February. Ok, enough of the credentialed hype. I did however need to establish they are probably a customer Gopro / Kolor would want to keep and make happy. So in January 2017 when my kids decided to start their company I said I would help fund this venture and we would run it under my website AVstuff.com that has previously been just a one page personal Ad for me as an AV engineer / technician. So we had big plans, (and still do in spite of the nightmare we have had with Gopro) to get this new venture rolling. So, I told them to do avid research into the VR / 360 camera market and at the time the consensus was the Omni Rig VR complete system package from GOpro was the way to go. So, in February 2017 we purchased direct from GOpro the Omni VR system for a little over $6000.00. Not a lot by professional video camera systems I use for my clients; But a sizable investment for me into this new venture with my kids. I'm just a AV technician supporting 3 kids and a house in CA. Anyway, let our nightmare story with GOpro and the VR software company Kolor begin. The Omni system consisted of six (Hero 5 cameras) along with a cube style mount to house the 6 cameras. that all sync together and record 6 simultaneous Hi-Def video feeds That after recording you import into a Hi-end computer (for us we also purchased from Apple the very latest Mac Pro Tower 8 core) a major professional editing machine. From the first day we started using are new Gopro system we had problems with the Kolor software that came with the package. Kolor a French company that Gopro had or was about to acquire was the key to making a finished sellable video product. The stitching program ""Auto Pana"" from Kolor had bugs in it and as we soon discovered, as we read the user forums in the VR communities we were not alone. This then began a new year long struggle to get our problem resolved. As a bit of research will attest; just type into google ""Gopro customer service"" and many, many horror stories like mine will come up. To make a long painful story speed up I’ll get to the point.It appears from my observations, experiences, user’s forum posts and a novice’s approach to analyzing stock charts, the yearlong decline in stock price has corporate mismanagement, insider trading and fraud written all over it. in the last month numerous class action law suits have been filed by various law firms relating to the Gopro Karma Drone product line. I however think; (my personal speculation) it goes beyond that and that their entire customer service division at some point was outsourced to a Philippines call center that is a total customer service scam. Problems across multiple product lines are never acted upon. Customers are promised follow up and placated in order to allow enough time to drain inventories of products, and dump insider shares and then sell what’s left of a once profitable company. A formal investigation into this needs to be done in my opinion. As of today, a least 100 plus hours of time trying to solve my Omni Rig/ Kolor Software problems have gone without ANY resolve or follow through on any of my problems. A tech company’s customer service reputation is the life blood of ALL future sales. Gopros mismanagement and alleged calculated greed has destroyed Gopro; once trading at $90.00 or so, now down to $ 5.00 and change. Where did all this money go? who sold and benefited? all needs to be looked into.",

They need to go back to making a solid camera with actual innovation and true quality and assurance.GoPro's problem is still at the top.

How is the mkt punishing GOOG?  It’s share price is down in line with the rest of tech. Just another buying opportunity.,
The article starts off with a good description of the company and then turns into a sci fi novel.The market probably was surprised at the $3b loss while its tech peers made money in line with expectations.Over the past year there have been rumblings around the decreasing rates google is able to charge per ad while Facebook as an example has been able to increase the rate it charges.Another issue is the cost of the ad. Google has had to pay higher fees to other companies for the opportunity to deliver an ad.While sales have increased year after year these issues are obstacles the company must solve. To date it has solved the problem by showing an increasing volume of ads to consumers. The question is how much longer can it shove more ads in consumers faces? Facebook has decided to decrease the volume of ads while increasing the cost to its customers.,
Think it is more concerns about government intervention and increasing TAC.    What I do not think is realized is Google is trying to rid all search competition and once that is done TAC will lower.MS is down to 47 bps on mobile which is down from 57 bps two months ago.   So they are close.http://bit.ly/2xLWoYrMobile Search Engine Market Share Worldwide | StatCounter Global ...,
"GOOG's primary valuation issue (if there is one) is Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC).  TAC has been growing significantly faster than revenues leading to lower gross margins.  This seems to be largely due to the shift to mobile and that Google must pay Apple and wireless carriers.  A continually sliding gross margin is a big problem and GOOG clearly needs to start playing hardball and reduce their payments.  Payments should certainly grow no faster than revenue. What is Apple going to do?  Block iPhone users from downloading Google Search or Google Maps?  I'd likely dump my iPhone.As far as Other Bets are concerned I don't think GOOG's valuation gives them any credit but I don't think they are hurting the valuation either.

Gilead is going to acquire CRSP?!?!?!?,
But why would GILD be that interested in CRSP?  What makes them at the top of the list?  They could easily go with another crisper company or even SGMO.  I would think they would be far more interested in a company that could transform its KITE Car-T franchise and convert this into a leader in the allogeneic market.,
"CLLS just issued second of two patents (January 2 and today, February 13- 2018) for CRISPR/Cas9 components.

Also, I wonder how a GILD M&A would affect partners, such as CELG, VRTX, et al.",
"I like to think about Crispr technology as about molecular cloning. Are there companies that monopolize cloning? No, it is just a technology widely used by everyone. There is no need to acquire a company, the reagents are cheap enough to purchase.",
I glad that these r only opinions WOW. let's b realistic.,
Gild isn’t purchasing anything. Fat cats who are happy to sit on past success of HVC.,
"Here's why I doubt it: 1. Gilead has a history of buying assets/companies that are in relatively late clinical stages of development2. If Gilead were to buy a gene editing company outright, it faces competition from Caribou, Editas, Intellia, Excision, and a few others getting into the mix.3. There is a patent issue brewing which, if stands, has CRISPR on the losing end of the fight and may result in royalty payments to Editas.4. The costs to bring CRISPR to clinic and eventually the market will be tremendous.5. Gilead may not see revenue from this purchase for many years to come (possibly a decade)6. While I have no doubts that CRISPR will bring about a revolution in medicine, there are many (and I mean many) questions that remain unanswered including safety and efficacy.7. CRISPR relies mainly on CAS-9, which if shown to be unsafe or ineffective will put the market share solely in Edita's or Excision's hands.8. Why buy a speculative company when you can simply mitigate risk by partnering?9. Since GIlead will need gene editing to complement their CAR-T program, what will that do the cost of their drug? What about the safety or efficacy? The verdict is out",
If there is a purchase of CRSP it is far more likely to be Bayer who already owns 12.2% after adding to their stake a few weeks ago.  Between them and Celgene who owns 6.1% it seems improbable they would endorse a Gilead offer given their competitive profiles.,Crispr Therapeutics: Is There Something Else Behind The Potential Gilead Acquisition?

"Sure, GE *might* rally a bit, but the downside risk is too prevalent.  What they have done in the past borders on fraud, with the hiding of liabilities and twisting numbers to make things look better than they are.  As the truth comes to light, I expect more capitulation.I agree that we may be nearing the turning point, but IMO, $13 is a near certainty, with a fair chance for going < $10, before we see a change.The volume on Jan 16th-19th was considerably higher than last Friday's volume. I think we have at least one more major fall-out ahead of us.In short, they will only be realizing about $7B of annual profit for the next 5 years, due to liabilities, and this is somehow supposed to support an EV of $280B! ???  (40:1 ratio)Although we think GE has bad sentiment, the fact that it's still trading at an EV/Earnings ratio of 40:1 is a sign that GE sentiment has further to fall.  Investors will stop being fooled by their PE 17, since their net debt is about $150B.Good luck on your long position.  But I'd be looking for a quick escape on the next surge.",
"I am sorry to say that I am disappointed by the author this time round. I also bought GE around 17-18, but saying a huge company with mostly stable businesses can go down to 12 just based on technical ain't making sense. GE will continue to sell high margin products in stable businesses like engines, health care products and the likes. They already mentioned that they wouldn't break up the company, but even if that were to happen it would probably increase its value by unlocking hidden value. GE Capital and baker Hughes brought the house down but massive impairment are now done. Each time a new direction comes up, they like to disclose as many rotten tomatoes as possible to blame it on the past management and make it easier for them to stage a comeback. Instead of focusing on a graph to look at technicals, I would expect an investment advisor to look at fundamentals and discuss where the company should be versus where it stands. Technicals only serve to time the market short term and are as good as a crystal ball.",
why not to buy GE now and later.  buy any time drop below $1 each.,
"GE will trade in the $12s as the market realizes current guidance is - yet again - more fiction.  Borrowing to fund the pension is a raging red flag - it's a way of artificially juicing earnings.  Divvy needs to be eliminated before GE has any hope of pulling out of it's problems.  Until they get real and fully address the magnitude of their massive debt and unfunded pension liabilities, only the biggest fools would invest in the GE house of cards.",
It’s hard to see how this is going to end well based on fundamentals. GE’s a different company now. Therefore Tech Analysis doesn’t work well. Looking at a “Support” level several years back makes no sense. It’s just smoke & mirrors.,
"GE current management needs to present much more detailed and coherent plans concerning the Alstom integration, the future of oil and gas, what is the plan going forward for the IofT and additive manufacturing in addition to the low hanging cost cutting decisions. Until we can evaluate such details, no one can predict the future stick price. Technical insight to stock price behavior are not inciteful  enough to be meaningful. Neither is fourth quarter net, since it represents only short term results from the new management. Had analysts asked more penetrating questions about the Alstom acquisition, the BHI deal, the stock buy back decisions, the almost 6 B investment in GE digital, software and the projected growth of the IofT, etc.,, I think they wouldn’t have projected a stock price of between 35 and 49 at the end of 2017. The dog and pony presentations by the former CEO, parroted by much of his staff had relatively no comprehensive, detailed execution plans, nor recognizable organizational focus. The idea that the management and the board could approve between 50B and 100B in cash outflow, buying back stock and acquisitions in the face of a looming cash flow problem  has to be a case of one of the most incompetent decision process in recent history. In the face of that process most of the financial analyst community were cheer leaders. As far as I can see that community is still not asking the right questions.",
Let's face it: DEAD MONEY FOR SEVERAL YEARS.,
"Although I do not necessarily disagree with the writer's analysis,  I think the support will be greatest between just under $12 a share to just under $14 a share.  If it breaks below $11, then it could fall all the way and test the 2009 low of around $5.  Back at that time GE's most well known problem was GE Capital being a ""bank.""  Now that Immelt is gone along with ""banking"" aspect (except for long-term healthcare liabilities), all of the other bad apples in the barrel are coming out which makes the company appear far worse than was known back then.  If GE does eliminate the balance of the dividend, I suspect that would be the bottom.  The only redeeming aspect appears the relative strength has been improving since worst low last November even as the stock has continued to fall.",

Need more management clarification on how GE is going to handle GE capital and shortfall in pension fund. There are too many unknowns and risks going long; there is a looming concern GE will be kicked out of Dow and SEC may be on GE for heavy insurance loss.  Unless half of these problems are cleared it is too early to jump back in. I do agree possible swing trade for short term pop opposite of GS.,
"I watch and wait after learning the hard lessons of the past year.  Fundamentally, the company needs to convince the market it has a new operating mantra based on transparent, understandable accounting—not the ouija board stuff of Immelt and others from the Jack Welch sperm bank.  Whether a 30 year veteran of that culture, Mr. Flannery, has the right stuff to do that, and can also convince skeptics of that, is a process that will take years, not quarters in my opinion.  Meantime, I keep buying puts at lower and lower levels and make money on each batch. I hope GE stock does turn the corner.  Best to all you remaining longs.",

In such cases, I focus on the worst case results.  I am not an expert in the airline industry but I do know container shipping pretty well.

Is there a capacity constraint at HA's airports?  For the record, I don't see UAL dumping their fares on HA to gain market share.

VictorWhen you get all those negative comments you know you must be on the right track.,
"A lively discussion to say the least!  Here are a few more thoughts:•	Even if Tesla produces the number of M3 that Victor predicts, and with his (optimistic?) gross margin, what would be a reasonable value for Tesla shares? $150 per share, ($5 EPS & PE of 30), $50, or the $15 suggested by one contributor.  Certainly not anywhere near $300.•	My own opinion is zero.  What matters is net profit and cash flow.  Not even members of the Tesla fan club have offered a path that leads to positive values for either of these metrics.  Yes, I know, Elon says GAAP positive by the end of 2018 - maybe.  And we all know how good his predictions have been.  The whole enterprise is a financial basket case.•	The test launch of the Falcon Heavy was a major success for SpaceX, and the landing of two out of three boosters back at the Cape was spectacular.  What doesn’t seem to have gotten much attention is the classic Elon-speak on the capabilities of the Falcon Heavy.  The payload to low earth orbit is claimed to be 140,000 lb., but if you dig, you find that is the payload without recovering the boosters.  If you leave enough residual fuel to do the recovery, and add the landing legs etc., the payload to LEO reduces to 18,000 lb. or about 1/8th of the headline number.  That’s why most other launchers don’t do it.•	I have noted elsewhere that SpaceX has executed far better than Tesla recently.  I have asked whether that is because Elon spends more time at SpaceX, or maybe the reverse.  Maybe he lets professional managers run SpaceX, while he tries to micro manage Tesla.  His delivery on the last conference call was better than the one before, but still less than convincing, and just plain flakey at times.  He was still hung up on the aerodynamic drag in the factory, but this time is was drag on the vehicles on the production line, rather than drag on the robotic arms serving it.  The fact that he even mentions aero drag on a production line should be enough to get most longs running for the exits.",
"Of course, what Victor missed in the analysts call, was that Tesla changed their language. They no longer ""forecast"" a particular number Model 3s produced in Q2, Q3 or Q4. Instead, they're ""targeting"" to produce 2500 or 5000 vehicles.Now suppose I have 1000$ in the bank right now. If I'd have to do an honest forecast, I might have 5000$ in the bank around Christmas time. However, I like to aim high, so that won't stop me from targeting to have a nice, round million in my bank account at the end of Q4.Why the change in Tesla's projections? Why go from a forecast, to merely targeting? Is Tesla scared of yet again missing one of their forecasts? Or are they perfectly aware of the fact, that the battery issues aren't the only thing holding their production back, and the chances of actually hitting 2500 or 5000 vehicles are too poor to give an actual estimate?",

If anything with each car added to the wild the buzz and brand elevates further. I know. I'm out in the Tesla trenches with current owners, investors, and future owners. Past owners are very difficult to find BTW.I took delivery on a model 3 two weeks ago after 4 years of prior model S ownership (2 different cars). I've been doing a thorough evaluation against my S and anything the market has to offer. It is a revolutionary car. Period. I don't state this lightly after 35 years as an avid car nut getting my hands on everything the car market has to offer. I didn't become a Porschephile divorcee lightly. It performs like a a high spec BMW 3 series while being over 30% more efficient than an S and over 20% more than a Bolt. The outward visibility and agile precise handling actually feels closer to my old Porsche 993.I applaud GM's efforts to get back into the EV market but after driving the Bolt can say it is not by any means a direct comp. The M3 is far superior. If GM offered a better product at a lower price I'd buy that but it's definitely not. Sorry not a put down on Bolt owners. Leaf, Leaf2, I3, etc.still apples to oranges.Jaguar? Take a good look at Jags annual sales numbers and market penetration. They're not going to be too quick to kill off what little of the market they already have with their current line. The I Pace will be at least as inefficient as the Bolt with less interior space but with a very nice archaic Jag grill ;-) Another Tesla killer? No. Hey, I'll be first in line to buy an authentic Tesla killer only there aren't any now and not for several years to come. By then you can count on Tesla to update- innovate current/future models to stay ahead of any competition. Don is not the only car guy around and opinions among us still widely vary. Soooooo:M3 production this year will be high margin models --- a good thingTargets stay 2500/wk end Q1--5000/wk end Q2---also goodMore deliveries to Canada to stretch Fed Tax credit---also goodEver increasing Tesla car pool mints new Tesla fanatics every day---good and getting betterYou really think that Tesla has nothing significant over its competitors than go out and drive everything like I do and compare it to Tesla. Long term ownership like mine only reinforces that assessment. Valuation? way high for a traditional car company and no way to completely assess what markets Tesla will be able to penetrate. Your guess is no better than mine. What to do?I've been adding to my long position during this recent dip. I encourage new short positions to help drive quarterly share price swings necessary to enable future realized gains. Battleground cult stock with +50% CAGR for the foreseeable future still intact.

"Victor- as an MBA and financial analyst I am surprised to see such an optimistic outlook for sales and production given the historical misses.  Your gross margin estimates are particularly out of reality.  The margins for 2015 and 16 were 23% on a much higher ticket price item S and X.  2017 dropped to 19% and close to 13% for 4th quarter.  This is why most objective evaluations are concerned that gross margins may never reach 25%.  It would be optimistic to use 23%.However, during the ramp up period we can expect much lower margins given the ramp difficulties already known about.  So for all of 2018, I think we can expect closer to 15-18%.  In regards to profits they do matter since operating expenses grew even faster than revenues at 70%.  The 2.2 billion loss for 2017 will most likely repeat for 2018.Cash is nice to have but the real number to watch is working capital which is negative and on a negative trajectory.  Tesla had to delay CapX payments in 2017 to 2018 and they project similar CapX for 2018.  A ramp in sales actually results in an increase in leverage because inventory has to increase which ties up cash.  With 1st qtr CapX needing to be paid and the extended trades, cash could dramatically drop in 1st qtr or current liabilities dramatically increase.  The delay in capx and extraordinary ZEV credits taken in 4th qtr were intended to delay recognition of Tesla’s dilemma.  I was a VP in banking for many years and a dramatic increase in sales like Tesla plans takes a lot more capital than they are carrying at this time.  That may be one reason for a slower ramp since they must realize fast sales growth at currently low margins will crush their finances.",
Shorts have made money on this the past year any sustained spike has resulted in profitableshort trade. The key now?? cover on the drops down to $300 and wait for the  new spike to say $325 to $330. The spikes will get progressively lower as Institutions (Morgan et al) reduce their sponsorship and no longer prop it up. The Bulls can play the opposite side and buy on drops and sell on the spikes but the truth is that Chanos is right. Remember last year when the Bulls said not to worry that by Q4 TSLA would be profitable. Remember when Elron said there would be no more needs for Capital. Now they are saying losses are immaterial because the profits which have never materialized are going to be so gigantic.

"Victor, good article. If I am may add to your previous comment: The best short squeeze will be when Tesla announces the manufacturing growth plans. It will be epic and I will explain it as follows: Projected growth will be slow, but gigantic, almost unbeleiavable. Wall Street likes growth stories, stock reaction will be swift and unwarranted, shorts will feel cheated and I DO NOT BLAME THEM, it will look like the biggest vaporware scheme of the century to fix climate change at a more rapid pace. So stock will shoot up, really, really high, will bury all the shorts and then stock will go though a period of instability only to recover from the high prices in 5-7 years, when volumes ramp up. It will be epic. My advice: Short after the announcements, but by all means, PLEASE do not be short before the announcement.What I just wrote, is just a possibility butI am very excited.",

"It is incredible that SA allows these sorts of self-interested promotional puff pieces be posted. I'm not sure if the author is incompetent, or purposely blind to a whole host of important facts.First of all, the drop in Tesla after its earnings report was probably helped by market volatility, but hoping to fool retail investors into thinking that stock market volatility is the only reason is just disingenuous. Tesla beat on adjusted loss per share by liquidating inventory, including almost all of its ZEV credits, as well as selling off a lot of their inventory of S and X models for reduced prices (as seen from the drastically reduced margins, once ZEV credit sales are removed from the equation...down to about 13%). Tesla also manipulated its accounting numbers by arbitrarily moving expenses paid in Q4 2017 to Q1 2018, and by holding off paying its bills until after its year end date (as seen from its drastically higher accounts payable, and drastically lower accounts receivable). Tesla manipulated its numbers so it could say that its cash burn was slowing, but the reality, for anyone who knows how to read a balance sheet, is that Tesla's performance in Q4 was far worse than people had expected. More importantly, those adjustments mean that Q1 2018 will be awful, because you can only sell your inventory and your ZEV credits once, and all the additional expenses they moved out of 2017 have to be realized at some point.Secondly, how can you still talk about what a profitable enterprise the Tesla Network (Tesla's contemplated autonomous ride sharing program) will be, when Tesla is nowhere near having the technology to make it a reality, let alone actually having logistics in place to make it happen. Auto companies have to report statistics to the government when doing tests on public roadways. These publicly available statistics show companies like Waymo (aka Google) and GM, leading the autonomous driving race, while Tesla has reported zero testing on public streets. Waymo has already launched its autonomous ride sharing program in  Phoenix. Tesla has not even announced a date for its L.A. to New York promotional trip (which had been announced to happen by the end of 2017), and Google has already launched its autonomous ride sharing service to the public. Even if Tesla was able to do the L.A. to New York autonomous trip tomorrow, they would still be leagues behind the pack, since highway driving is, by far, the easiest form of driving to automate. Google has been testing on far more complicated city streets for years, and Tesla isn't even in the game. If (and that's a big ""if"") the Tesla Network makes it to market, it will be years behind competing products from Google, GM, and likely others. Tesla has shown absolutely nothing to convince us that any such launch is anywhere in the foreseeable future. Talking about revenue from Tesla's autonomous ride sharing network is like talking about revenue from my autonomous vehicle ride sharing network, because I am about as close to launching one as Tesla is.The fact of the matter is that doubling Tesla's revenues means absolutely nothing. Extra revenues mean nothing when they are outpaced by the increasing rate of losses. It is absolutely incredible that a stock can exist on the market that is worth over $300 a share, while losing over $3 a share in a single quarter ($4 a share, if you look at the structural loss with proper accounting principles). Even if Tesla achieved all of the lofty things you talk about in your article, Tesla still wouldn't justify anything close to its current valuation. It is currently valued like profitable direct competitors that are already 20 times its size (based on revenue and assets). In the article, you are talking about all the great economies of scale that Tesla could possibly achieve, if they can ever ramp the model 3, yet you ignore the fact that all of Tesla's competitors already enjoy far greater economies of scale, since they produce 10M+ cars a year. Even all the unrealistic estimates in this article would not come close to justifying a $300/share stock price, let alone the ridiculous $500/share stock price talked about in the conclusion. If valued based on industry norms, Tesla would be worth about $15 per share based on assets and revenue, and less than that if you calculate in the fact that they are burning cash like crazy. The stock price is based on the Greater Fool theory, and eventually, the bottom will drop out of it. Make no mistake, Tesla does not need to fail as a company for the stock price to plummet. Tesla could hit every goal talked about in this article and still plummet, simply because the stock price valuation is unrealistic. At some point, you simply run out of greater fools.",

"Article is full of conjecture...""what we do know is that Tesla was producing roughly 1,000 Model 3s per week by the end of 2017"".  We don't know that, in fact the data indicates that was more fluffery from Elon and they were closer to 700/week.  Tesla won't hit 25% GM without excluding MORE items from the GM calculation on the M3.  It's a cheaper and lower margin product than the S or X.  This isn't hard to figure out.If Tesla can make 2 billion in gross profits on the M3 they'll have a shot at regaining a path to sustainability.  But I don't see how they can make those kinds of margins unless the rest of the car is so cheaply put together that it'll fall apart rather quickly. Good thing is the M3s that get moved can share a lot of the SG&A costs associated with S and X but it won't be a total free ride.  I suspect real margins on the M3 are going to be closer 8 or 10% maybe 12% on a very highly optioned car.  Can they make money with margins that tight after the M3 has picked up its smaller piece of other costs?  I'm not sure they can.  Negative real margins on the M3 will further expand losses.  Assuming a 25% real gross margin, or even a Tesla calculated margin shows a lack of understanding with regard to the automotive space.  Won't hit 25% unless they further exclude additional costs.",
"Re liquidity, you say:  ""This is much higher than many people expected and suggests that Tesla is collecting significant deposits for future products, is managing its cash burn rate much better, and will not require a capital infusion in the foreseeable future.""Nonsense.  What drove the higher than expected cash was the rise in accounts payable, the deposits for the roadster, the recent lease securitization, and the decreased capex in the quarter which Elon himself states will increase in 2018.   Further, as Elon or Deepak stated, some of those measures to preserve liquidity were nonrecurring.",

""A key point often missed is Cirrus does not have a Cirrus-labeled chip in any Apple product. What is this double talk? Cirrus provides Apple with IP, engineering and hardware all labeled with Apple numbers. Apple is in complete control.""Do you think that because CRUS's chips are labeled as Apple products it makes it less likely that Apple will dump CRUS?One other point that I think can get overlooked is that if Apple wanted to make their own codecs, the easiest and cheapest way to do that would be to buy CRUS at these prices.  Apple could pay for CRUS with the cash that they find in the couch cushions in the employee lounge.  Still long and excited for Mr. Market to change his mind and begin to view the Apple relationship as a positive rather than a negative.Earwig",
"Cirrus is a good company for all the reasons cited. However, the Wolfson acquisition was supposed to enlarge customer base and revenue percentages, but I don't see that happening in any substantial manner.  The PROBLEM with AAPL is that they get excited about things that NOT ALL of their customers want, or want to pay for.  And when that happens, suppliers get hurt. From CRUS earnings report its known that stock buybacks are used to reward employees. So I wonder it those shares don't really end up back in the float.  CRUS needs to acquire a more broad offering of products, OR, be acquired by a similar thinking leading edge company (NVDA comes to mind).  But since CRUS's niche is so small, paying a premium to acquire such small (and unpredictable) revenue stream really isn't attractive to anyone. Conclusion: CRUS will have a very tough 2018, and getting meaningful traction on 2019 sales optimism is at best a 50/50 gamble, in my opinion.",

Engineering first, last and in the middle too - backed by very slick product concept.Mr Musk is not so focused. Yes, and ideas man but has too often directly intervened in the vehicle programes, frequently at a real cost of revised tooling as well as timing delay. There just has not been the discipline to concentrate on getting the product as right as possible from the design concept. All too often the meddling leads back to one person - E.

"Hello! I have tracked Tesla for many years, and am an automotive engineer. I know about production, design and development. The key to Model 3's difficulties lies in the cap ex intensive tooling - switching from an aluminium intensive body structure to an mainly steel structure, when the entire company to date has been used to the former. JLR did the opposite - steel to aluminium - many years ago and took a huge knock as the in-house expertise had to re-learn how to form as well as join aluminium. Given Tesla has often used 'not invented here' mode, this might explain the difficulties around the relatively low value but very critical quality of the Model 3 body.There's more. Upon trawling through the Model S and Model X workshop manual we can see many, many boxes for the electronic modules packed literally everywhere. The tooling cost as well as component / assembly cost of those boxes, the internals, and the associated harness is far, far higher than the norm. This points to a functional but poorly integrated electronics system.Tesla faces many hurdles, but the migration from hand built Roadster to a fully fledged cost optimized mainstream OEM was never going to be easy. However I would have expected to see more high level thought in the design of the product which seems to have been only evident in the function - but not all details - of the electronic system. The rest? Average to not good.The efficient way to control cost is at the design stage. Everything after that is managing consequences.That means Tesla Model S was about right (low investment, high piece cost), Model X was wrong (too many things to go wrong, but essentially a Model S case) and Model 3 needs to be completely re-engineered. Effectively the only way out is to scrap Model 3 and lay down the platform for Model Y- if the money to do this can be found, along with deep, deep thinking for all aspects of the product design. In reality this is unlikely to happen without support from another OEM - automotive or otherwise.",

But what's happening with this guy's pre-order vs. orders placed just now via a previous owner's account .... there's just no financial excuse except that Tesla wants to favor previous customers, and there is no way for one to take an action to get delivery sooner like there is with your ""strategic blunder.""

The improvement is continous, following the latest advances in the society. This philosphy was created to realize the idea of ""just-in-time"" manufacturing.It is regarded as one of the most disruptive concept in the recent history of industry, and was largely adopted in the 90's, even outside the industrial world. It is required to have it if you want any chance to compete in the mass-manufacturing industrial world. Tesla proved many times that they are light-years away to have implemented this philosphy in their company, the multiple delays being a symptom of the lack of this philosophy. When Johnson asked his question, he wanted to know if the management was aware of the main mistake that led to the current production hell.But no, Tesla is blinded by believing the Silicon Valley's philosophy of ""launch fast, fix later"" is going to disrupt the world of industrial manufacturing. It certainly worked for short-life software-based products. And of course, implementing software updates for a car is brilliant, and they made good innovation in the product. But the waste of money is also huge, and they have no Production System to avoid it.This is, in my opinion, the most bearish risk for Tesla in the long term, as it will prevent them of making any profits for years, whatever they try to do.But Elon Musk has a huge bullish power, and is viewed as a steamroller able to reach any goal he decides. Which is quite funny, because he consistently miss the goals he sets. He somewhat convince people that he achieved them anyway. He is inspiring. And as long as the confidence in him is there, he will get all the money he wants.So, the main questions for anyone trying to short Tesla are: What will harm this confidence? When will it happen?Possible answers:- Less than 150'000 model 3 deliveries in 2019- More than $3 billions loss in 2018- A fundamental flaw in model 3 with a massive recallOr maybe, even if I don't think it's possible, the Model 3 failures in production will open the eyes of the investors on the terrible Tesla Production System, that has nothing disruptive to offer, except burning money in a very fashionable way.And if you want a glimpse on how the Toyota Production System works, read this article:http://bit.ly/2BtwI7j(And if you don't understand why this is not a Toyota factory, just stay long on Tesla)",
"I drove a 2018 Nissan Leaf last weekend.  Incredibly nice car.  Solid, drove well, quiet, and very comfy.

"User,I am wondering if there might be a somewhat unexpected ""shoe to drop"" when the 10-K is released within the next two weeks. Maybe/ maybe not; if no, price stays  about the same; if yes, it drops a lot. Do a present value/ Monte Carlo simulation on that. (Shorts can use buzz words also.)",
"Just wanted to add some first ideas. These are the fields where I think Teslas problems might become obvious this year. So this is not a list of Teslas major problems, but a list of the problems that no one can ignore in the next months, even the less informed: Tesla being behind in autonomous driving (if major accidents happen or if competitors launch their advanced systems)Selling figures of competitor's EV models (and just the fact that any introduction of a new EV model will get press coverage. Insiders at SA now about the competition coming, but the general public will only really get it when those models are on the roads and in the news)Professional reviews of other EV cars vs Tesla Model 3Owners reporting Technical problems with model 3, high repair costs (these will get more attention once the first non-Tesla-owners get their model 3.Increased problems with Models X and S, as the fleet grows older.Lacking demand for model 3 (that is already obvious on Ebay.com. If you just display completed sales, there are new models 3s that seem to be selling with little or no additional charge. So much for the tale of 400.000 people eagerly waiting to get their Model 3. You can get one instantly on Ebay. And why are there so many offers anyway, if people have supposedly been dying to get their Model 3?)Maybe more departures of key personnel, accompanied perhaps by anonymous reports about production problems at Tesla.I think there will be more problems becomoing really obvious for the general public this year. I would appreciate anyone adding to this list, detailing some of the points, or contradicting them.",
"Dear Montana, thanks for this very precise and well-written article. I have been following the discussion at Seeking Alpha for some weeks now, and what really strikes me is that there are several bears that present really convincing arguments here, whereas I have discovered almost no substantial analysis from the Bull's side (or at least a short comment that containts something valid). Just wanted to ask a question to you Bears (Montana, CoverDrive, Rogus, Cunningham, Enertution etc): Many of you emphasize that you think the stock can still rise for a long time. Obiously it is the experience that you have had: Many of the shocking developments at Tesla were already there some years ago - and you have been documenting these already back then - but the stock conntinued to rise. But my impression is that the major problems at Tesla are getting so obvious now that at least some institutional investors can just not ignore them any more. I would be really happy to read some thoughts about this core question: Haven't we reached a point where the problems are becoming so obvious to anyone that the stock does not even need a trigger to begin its decline?I am appreciating any comment on this.",

"Thanks Montana for the Shout out in the article. I think your article is spot on. When shorting a beloved cult stock, you can expect vehement defense. There is a long list of bodies that the longs point to and say ""See, he was WRONG"" - and in a sense they are correct. If one shorted the stock at $100 and it went to $350, they were wrong to do so. You have pointed out in many articles the dangers of shorting this particular cult stock. I find it interesting that only now, when you tiptoe into the short, their reaction is how wrong you've been ""all along"". This stock trades more on hopes and dreams than nearly any other stock I have ever seen. And why should we be surprised at that? A brash, rich , comic book hero who can launch cars into space? Pretty cool.... The idea of creating a better world  and saving humanity? Sounds sexy. So all his machinations and odd comments are forgiven, for now. Here's how I see this playing out - between conference calls, all the hopes and dreams drive the stock higher. But when earnings and the cold water of reality come out... even the bravest take a step back and we get a 40 point swoon. In between reality doses, its back into the Matrix..We'll watch the lower highs and lower lows during the trading swings. Everytime Tesla trades to 300, it has firm support. Will be interesting to see how it behaves on the next trip. From the dream side the following announcements will certainly be coming - and everytime one of these hits, we should see a spike..""We really did hit 2500, at least this week""""Our production problems are solved yeah - promise""""Look over here - the Model Y plan - Did I mention 1 million per year?""""Let's have a contest to see the location for the ""Semi"" factory...""""Yes model X and S are constrained at 100,000 - but DEMAND is so high... we'll expand that anyway to 120,000 - here's the cash burn plan for that""So you'll have to get through all these things first... for me I'll just wait for the cold bucket of water, called the quarterly report, and put some options on ahead of that. Can always count on Elon to go full Elon on the call.Trading this stock now takes a katana, not a calculator. You're battling the master of spin, and his rocket ship minions.",
"Tesla long term puts are very expensive. 2020 310 put trades at 100 plus wide bid-ask spread. And don't forget tesla has a build-in put at about 100-120, because of Musk's asset in spacex and strong valley connections. So, you have a break even at about 200, and realistically a return of 50-80 points. It doesn't look like an attractive trade to me, especially paying that decay every day sounds like a Chinese water torture. Buying puts is a highly leveraged play, big risks.",

"Let’s expand another thesis item.  I’ve probably already said enough about Hubris and Battery Cost, so let’s move on to:6. The Model 3 ShortcutsWow, this is big.  Let me start by saying that reducing development cycle time is the holy grail of new product development.  There have been untold millions spent on improving, refining, and re-engineering the process.  In today’s best practice, it has boiled down to Production Part Approval Process, or PPAP.  All of the specification, design, testing, validation and schedule are targeted at PPAP submission in time for the production verification build (about 6 mo prior to launch).  At PPAP submission, you must not only submit test data to prove that you meet every detail of the specification; you must also prove that you can build components at production rates with suitable manufacturing yield.  There is nothing left to chance at vehicle launch.What we are seeing with the Model 3 launch is exactly the opposite.  Tesla decided to launch without any of this engineering rigor.  Did they save time and money by skipping critical design testing phases?  Yes.  Did they save time and money by skipping critical manufacturing testing phases?  Yes.  As a result, do they find themselves in the 9th level of manufacturing hell?  Yes.  Tesla would’ve needed to be dead lucky to launch without significant issues.  For whatever reason (time or money), failure was an option for them.  Tesla is not experiencing bottlenecks.  They are experiencing screw-ups.  Two of the screw-ups were highlighted in the CC.  There are hundreds more lurking below the surface.  You cannot engineer a car by hoping for good luck.  You need discipline.",
"Montana, I've been grappling with your short thesis. I have a question for you, and believe me, it is a mark of respect. As I work through the dependency analysis, it seems clear to me that Tesla has itself in somewhat of a trap. I really don't have any argument with your points. And as far as I can tell, and I have made a good faith attempt to figure it out, Tesla's major constraint NOW is not so much production but the Service Center bottleneck. I don't see what good it is for Tesla to be producing even 3K cars a month if it can't deliver them, and it is clear that they always intended to cushion the cash costs of a ramp by first delivering to markets that were close so that they could profit from their lead time with the suppliers. But that means Canada and the US, and with current quality, I think 3K Model 3s a month would test their service capacity, and 5K Model 3s a month would overload it in those two markets. They still have to sell and service their S/X cars, after all. And as the current fleet ages, their Service Centers naturally have more work to do on it. So, assuming that they can bring the Model 3 quality up enough to be able to deliver 5K cars a month in these two markets in the next five months without creating angry mobs at the SCs, I ask myself: ""What stands a chance of cushioning margins enough to let them go on with the ramp?"" The only answer I can come up with is the tech packages. If Tesla had the tech to actually do a fine job of EAP and something in the FSD lines - say a really strong Driver Assist - not only would it create good sales opportunities on their existing cars, but they could license it. This is a company that desperately needs a revenue stream!So my question to you and anyone else on this forum who cares to seriously engage with it is this:Is there a company that Tesla could buy that would bring in the tech that they don't have within the near term? With 170 million shares outstanding, issuing a few million more shares means nothing if it gives Tesla a way out of their predicament. Tesla may or may not have the ability to raise capital by a big stock issue, but I do believe it has the capability to buy a company with a big stock issue. And while I do not believe at all in the Semi thing, I do believe that there is currently a latent and very strong market for driver assist packages in trucking. The insurance costs are so high that even marginal safety improvements that can cut that insurance bill will support a rather high per-truck cost, and very large companies would be likely to sign up to test it. The words ""We think this has the potential to save you 10% a year on your liability insurance cost"" are going to open a lot of doors and a lot of wallets.",
"Bravo Montana.In response to an early comment (apologies but I didn't note the poster and too many comments to search through again!), I suspect the Bond holders may have a stronger lever to force TSLA's hand. They rank above the shareholder in the event of a credit ""issue"". As an equity professional the concept of cash flow, free cash flow, pre- and post-capex (growth vs maintenance etc.) are pillars of my investment process. However, for many other equity investors this is simply not the case. My (limited) experience of corporate bonds is that cashflow, and judgments thereof, is always up front and center of the analysis. So, if the bond holders lose confidence they can sell. A dramatic tick up in yield (by which I mean >100bp's ) will act as a signal to all stakeholders. Ergo, if the bond holders get worried, start ringing up the CFO then the CFO listens and does what he can to keep them calm. If he doesn't/can't then the yield rise signals to other claims in the capital hierarchy that all is not well. Selling TSLA equity is one hedge available to most (institutional) holders of the debt. Often the credit markets see the reality of bankruptcy prior to the equity holders where hope can prevail longer without the discipline of having to pay regular coupons.The slant of Muni_Bond_Guy's comments, I think, alludes to this kind of thought process.",

"Well I'm glad you are finally gambling more of your own money by speculating on a Tesla short position. I am disappointed that you hedged your bet via options. I had hoped that you really stood behind your words and gambled via margin and bet at least $200,000.Since you are using options I assume that you placed a small gamble of about $5,000 to $10,000 in total value. In other words you lack conviction and just publish propaganda. The facts are that Tesla has transformed old auto by disrupting ICE with EV. Furthermore Tesla   is now disrupting the business model of old auto with direct sales and service. Tesla is also vertical integrated and moving to high automation and has launched a perfect EV platform for autonomous driving. As you state many old auto companies are rushing into the EV space with offerings that will be sure to loose them billions in ICE wright downs and EV development cost.  In fact GM admitted to loosing over $9,000 per Bolt and Porsche executives admitted that they might not ever be profitable with EV's.Once again you failed to mention all the capacity constraints faced by old auto when lunching EV models due to all EV drive components being out sourced to LG Chem and China. You also did not mention that every old auto manufacture that has plans to sell EV's in china are forced to share all profits 50% with their joint Chinese partner and that they are forced to share all EV IP. To date only Tesla has plans to begin manufacturing  a Chinese free trade zone and will not be forced to share EV IP or 50% of profits with a Chinese joint partner. Instead they will pay a modest tariff. Once again you base your assumptions on faulty data and a total lack of strategic planing, market awareness or industry history. I mean you never mention the complex multi year/decade labor agreements VW, Ford and other old auto manufactures are locked into. Do you even know why VW sells about the same amount of cars Toyota and GM does but is required to employee double the workers? Your analysis lacks any critical thinking and demonstrates that you should NOT be an investor and are very dangerous to any one than believes in your propaganda. Have a great day.",

"Long overdue haha :)If i may add regarding the structureIf one is shorting this company with just buying puts; instead of buying the longest duration available it is cheaper to buy options with a life of about 1.5 years and then roll them about 2 months before they expire.Concerning hedging a portfolio with a TSLA short; maybe there are some situations in which it makes sense as a small part of a larger hedge. However, even though TSLA corrects more then, for example, the NASDAQ on down days so far it has been cheaper and more profitable to go long volatility to hedge equity long exposure. To be honest, it doesnt really make sense at all, as all large pullbacks in TSLA stock price were preceeded by vol spikes and general market turmoil. Even after the last two weeks and the inverted VIX curve, long term vol is still cheaper. I think TSLA is one of the few stocks out there who could see a Sun Edison type event before the next bear market arrives and even though it is strongly correlated to general market momentum i would isolate this position as much as possible. My personal experience as a trader learned me to always put up a counter position. Sometimes as a hedge against my position but always as a hedge for my subjectivity regarding my thesis. It does make one more objective and you can smile when the clown in chief tweets about his next great product/lie. Im a little bit ashamed to say it but i made more on the upside even though im net short this stock since 2013. I never try to time anything (anymore..lol) and this is my biggest lesson i learned in the markets. One of the few things in this profession which actually helps me in my social life. For moral reasons, i want to see this company fail. If the market disagrees, thats ok, but i still want to be ahead of this stupidity, and i want to live to trade another day. So, even though i feel weird going long TSLA sometimes, i highly recommend a mixed strategy, no matter on what your short thesis is based. Over the years, i saw many shorts here getting burned, to never hear from them again. There is a new generation of shorts here on SA and i feel the same thing is getting repeated again as a lot of comments from shorts here show some kind of impatience about their investment and outright fear about the power of the TSLA fanbase. I find it pathetic, as it implies some sort of forecasting abilities which we all know is impossible. Bulls make money, bears make money and pigs are getting slaughtered, i dont like this saying but it seems true.There is a saying in German i like very much; ""Der Weg ist das Ziel"" which loosely translates to ""the journey is the aim"". In this case it means dont try to time your investment, try to have fun wherever this investment takes you. If a 100$ boost in the stock price gets on your mood dont f do it. Or position yourself in way so you always have fun on your journey.Take care and be nice to your brother in arms, volatility :)",
"There may only be four bullets left in the chamber, but shorting this is still Russian Roulette.The believers still want to believe. Many of them are still up over 1000% form their initial investment - to them Tesla is already an outstanding success. Some of them are drawing an income from short interest, and have already made a real profit. They have never shown any serious regard to fundamentals or any realistic sales projections, and think this thing should trade at Amazon multiples once profits do eventually materialise.Personally, I suspect the only thing holding the stock DOWN is the fact that the company is running out of cash. The bulls don't like to talk about it, but it is a thought almost certainly in the back of their minds. But if Musk can address that issue, and history tells us this is the one thing that he truly excels at, then the stock could break out once the Model 3 starts ramping up again.The other thing to realise is that the volumes traded in this stock are extremely high, which means there is a LOT of day trader activity here. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them were willing to help recapitalise Tesla to keep the easy money coming (plenty of ""dumb"" money short and long to extract profits from). If you absolutely must short it, at least wait until the technicals favour it. And hedge. Definitely hedge.",

I've been doing a thorough evaluation against my S and anything the market has to offer. It is a revolutionary car. Period. I don't state this lightly after 35 years as an avid car nut getting my hands on everything the car market has to offer. I didn't become a Porschephile divorcee lightly. It performs like a a high spec BMW 3 series while being over 30% more efficient than an S and over 20% more than a Bolt. The outward visibility and agile precise handling actually feels closer to my old Porsche 993.I applaud GM's efforts to get back into the EV market but after driving the Bolt can say it is not by any means a direct comp. The M3 is far superior. If GM offered a better product at a lower price I'd buy that but it's definitely not. Sorry not a put down on Bolt owners. Leaf, Leaf2, I3, etc.still apples to oranges. Jaguar? Take a good look at Jags annual sales numbers and market penetration. They're not going to be too quick to kill off what little of the market they already have with their current line. The I Pace will be at least as inefficient as the Bolt with less interior space but with  a very nice archaic Jag grill ;-)   Another Tesla killer? No. Hey, I'll be first in line to buy an authentic Tesla killer only there aren't any now and not for several years to come. By then you can count on Tesla to update- innovate current/future models to stay ahead of any competition. Don is not the only car guy around and opinions among us still widely vary. Soooooo: M3 production this year will be high margin models --- a good thingTargets stay 2500/wk end Q1--5000/wk end Q2---also goodMore deliveries to Canada to stretch Fed Tax credit---also good Ever increasing Tesla car pool mints new Tesla fanatics every day---good and getting betterYou really think that Tesla has nothing significant over its competitors than go out and drive everything like I do and compare it to Tesla. Long term ownership like mine only reinforces that assessment. Valuation? way high for a traditional car company and no way to completely assess what markets Tesla will be able to penetrate. Your guess is no better than mine. What to do?I've been adding to my long position during this recent dip. I encourage new short positions to help drive quarterly share price swings necessary to enable future realized gains. Battleground cult stock with +50% CAGR for the foreseeable future still intact. Way to short sighted to call any clarity on future demise....",
"Tesla needs to communicate directly with it's reservation holders - honestly, promptly, and agreed... not to avoid facing the music is... cowardly.They also need to get a Model 3 in every showroom, ASAP.  Treating Flyover Country as just that means it's still just a premium toy for the wealthy.",
"Regarding the short thesis, personally I am not there yet.  My short thesis is much simpler.  That is, the stock is supported only by emotion, therefore the time to short is when emotions are set to be dashed.  I see enormous (mostly irrational) hope that Tesla is just about to turn the corner on production and then we will see that Elon was right all along that there are vast profits to be made by this company in its current configuration.  It just needs a little more of that $40K ASP volume.The company finds itself in a situation where it actually benefits from all the M3 production foul-ups because they push off the day of reckoning.  I see that emotional inflection point coming about 5-8 months from now.Another reason I have not jumped in short this time is that I am in the process of reducing exposure across my portfolio.  It has occurred to me, however, that if a person is very concerned about the end of this bull market, a Tesla short could make a good hedge.  If we enter a secular bear market, chances are that Tesla will be hit much harder than the average stock, so shorting TSLA might be a hedge to consider.",
the end will be sudden and quick when it will be impossible for Musk to sugarcoat the slowing demand,
"I just have one little quibble with this article.  The author discusses the decision to hide the news about the $36K delay as if it was hiding bad news.  Tesla has done that many times, such as claiming their AP was advanced when it was actually many years behind the hype.  Such is not the situation with the $36K model.  That requires no R&D whatsoever.  Tesla simply DECIDED they would rather take $42K or $45K than $36K as long as possible.  They could ship the $36K units tomorrow if they wanted to.This was not a case of management taking the cowardly way out of bad news.  It is a case of a cold-blooded management simply deciding to screw a set of customers and renege on their central promise of Model 3 the very same week they awarded Musk millions more shares.I am not convinced Tesla will pay a price for that.  Their customers exhibit Stockholm Syndrome.  It could be that this extra pain will only make their hearts grow fonder.",
Montana thanks for the article. Im short and will stay but I dont agree with you. In fact closed two thirds of the position around 310. Its just not the time to extend and go full force. It needs a trigger and thats just not there yet. The fans will eat the delays for now as it is still cool to be inline for the product of the guy firing the rockets. The believers think below 300 is very cheap. Nothing much has changed. It will though but not right now.,
"ok there are a lot of really strong bear cases for Tesla, but this report was just plain brain-dead. I didn't think it was possible to be this retarded. Not gonna comment any further cause your article says it all...",
"I think it is a bit too early. Wait for another distraction. Some positive news on SpaceX or Boring company, or Model Y/solar roofs announcements. Something that looks cool but does not help Tesla's dreadful financial situation. Only short then with expiration date after the next Q reporting. That strategy worked for me well.",

"Spent a long weekend in LA....saw Model S and X absolutely everywhere (did NOT see any terrible panel lines).  Stopped by the Century City Telsa store to sit in a Model 3 (after spotting one charging at Peterson's Museum).  Not only was it a great car...but had to wait in line to get my 3-4 minutes of sit time, while a line formed behind me.  Personally I really liked the seats and great paint, found the touch screen intuitive and easy to view and navigate.  Lots of room for an adult in the rear seats too.  Quite a nice car!PS I did see maybe 4-5 i3's....but probably 30 or more Teslas.  Saw one Volt, no Bolt.",
"As Chicago Skeptic noted, Tesla bonds are down. The lowest trade for Tesla's bonds as of my writing (on http://bit.ly/2Brsj4D) was at $93.02, which implies a yield of 6.8%. I don't have real-time ""B"" rated bond prices – those have risen sharply, from 6% on Feb 1st to 6.5% Friday (see the series on FRED at http://bit.ly/2BUAHL4). Tesla's bonds closed with a 6.57% yield on Friday, and were around 5.9% on Feb 1st. The 5.3% coupon at issue compares with a 5.8% yield in August 2017 (I assume the effective yield at issue was above 5.3%). So there may have been a modest deterioration in price over the past months. However, given the noise component of thinly traded securities, it looks like the pricing is comparable to that of other ""B"" rated bonds and that what we are seeing reflects the change in the interest rate environment and not anything specific to Tesla.We should watch whether these bonds continue to track the market. If they diverge (in a negative direction), that would strengthen the ""short"" case.I began moving a my retirement portfolio [broadly-based mutual funds with TIAA] into cash a few months ago, at the rate of 1% or so a week. I don't see much upside, and the potential for downside, and am approaching retirement so that 100% equities isn't sensible. However, I already spend too much time watching the market, I'm behind on finishing an (academic) paper disparaging the idea that the auto industry is ripe for disruption from AVs or EVs or ""sharing"". Could I risk 5%? Hmmm....I am not going to learn how to short, it's a sinkhole for time of which I have little, and as Montana warns us, potentially for money as well.One final comment: Montana's ""short"" comes with a 2020 time frame – it is not one aiming for the quick profit sought by technical traders. The many on this site who mention short-run swings in prices need to read and think more carefully about what he said.",
The bulls might want to pay attention to the fact that Tesla's bonds are trading lower than ever.,

But did you get to know:Germany will increase it's tax credit in near future because too few people are jumping on the EV train yet. The upcoming new government has already decided to do so.So the EV demand will surely increase in Germany and other EU countries as well.And be aware, even the tiny BMW I3 is more expensive than the M3.So will be the Audi, the Jaguar,and probably also the VW's coming.Because actually German car makers are not really interested in EVs,there are few models at high prices.The M3 will be welcome in such a scenario.So Elon, please send as many M3 over as possible.Demand is there.

"The big unknown is Q4 2018 Sales numbers. Assuming Model 3 hits 5k/w, + 25k S/X = 90k cars to be built in Q4 2018. That's almost as many as they sold in all of 2017. But, can they sell 90k cars with half a tax credit when competitors have a full Tax credit? Historically, TSLA has seen large demand drops in areas after tax credits are reduced. One of Musk's rabbits will likely be an announced Model S Refresh (It's getting kind of old)By Q4, will people that bought an S 3 years ago buy the same car for half the tax credit when they could have a new Jag / Audi for a full tax credit? I think they reach the 2,500/week that has been promised. If they don't they won't be able to raise any more $$$ and they need that soon....",

More interesting times ahead.On the upside, I look forward to not seeing many more comments about the vaporware version.of Model 3 on my articles. Thanks for the shout out.",
"Montana Skeptic,As always, a very entertaining and informative read.I was a bit surprised to see your shift (however mild and heavily hedged) in advice regarding TSLA.  I disagree with nothing you wrote, but I'm also not convinced this is the beginning of the end.  Musk has been telling ever wilder tales for years, but the congregation has been lapping it up in an ever-more-mindblowing manner.  If I had a dollar for every time I thought reason would overtake irrational exuberance...well, I'd have a bout twenty dollars, but you get my point.I now believe that tales of the Model Y will direct focus away from Model 3 blunders; just as launching his car into space stole focus from the conference call; just as truck nonsense did with last earnings; just as Model 3 stories stole focus from Model X miscues; just as solar roof baloney stole focus from the SolarCity debacle; and just as Powerwall and Gigafactory nonsense stole focus from increasingly horrendous financials and declining margins.Back when I was writing, I even published an article asking if Elon was finally running out of rope with his increasingly ridiculous double-speak and obviously non-viable business.  Apparently not at that time, and I'm not convinced we are close now.  Closer, no doubt, but probably not close enough.  Just look at the comments here.  I thought what we were hearing 18 months ago was preposterous enough, but it has only gotten weirder and wilder.  There will be a tipping point, for sure, but what it will take is likely even more than what we have seen.Best of luck with your investment, and thanks for adding some legitimate research and reason to the conversation.",

"Now it begins!The stock having bounced off the bottom during the recent violent market fluctuations begins its rise back to the 350 area to test new highs as the production continues to accelerate.I want to thank the shorts for all their negativity and nihilism, it forms a good underpinningfor the rise of the phoenix.Wait until TESLA opens deposits reservations for the Model -Y that should produce epic cash!",
"Thanks MS for another well written compendium of TSLA's failings and failures.Given the overall market's strength and TSLA's bump higher here, I added a small 1/3 portion of out of the money puts for this week's expiration.Once again my intention is to try and sell out of the money puts later this week in a way that would recoup a significant part of the cost basis while enabling me the potential of a $10-$15 spread.Last week this strategy has played quite well and I still have a few put spreads with much higher strike prices for which I wrote lower strike puts that are still well out of the money, so hopefully the time decay would enable me to close those spreads out close to their maximum value even before the expiration on Friday.Looking for 320-321 as a stop level on this new 1/3 portion if it goes the wrong way (for me ;) )",

Seeing as how the current price is relatively close to $300, a safer play would be to wait until TSLA CLOSES below $300 with authority before shorting. My tea leaves, chicken bones, and crystal ball are telling me that TSLA will continue oscillating between the wide range of $300-$390 for quite sometime, until the ""bottlenecks"" are worked out, and Tesla proves that it can make money (or not). I am actually long with a tiny, speculative position. To me, TSLA is like Babe Ruth at the plate. Sure he strikes out a lot, but I wouldn't bet against him...",
"Great article, Montana!  There's plenty of discussion on investing strategies here, so instead I'll take the opportunity to add some colour to some of your thesis points.  First up:5. The Model S and X Growth Stories Are OverIt's interesting that Tesla finally made a public comment on this, even though it's been evident in their production numbers for quite some time.  Production of MX has been flat for 6 quarters and production of MS has been flat for an astonishing 3 years!  The sales growth story has been perpetuated in 2017 by stockpiling inventory in the first half of the year and then dumping it in the second half.  It will be harder to play that game again.And they can conveniently point to Panasonic's inability to supply more 18650 cells.  I'm guessing that Panasonic wants more tooling money for more capacity.  And Tesla is unwilling to make that gamble.  Can they get cells elsewhere?  It's unlikely because these cells are made uniquely to Tesla's requirements. And Panasonic probably holds IP that would make it difficult for a competitor.  I can't see a business case for any supplier to spending tooling money on 18650's.  So 100k/year it is.  Maximum.",
"I notice many Tesla bulls keep repeating how great the Tesla cars are, including the Model 3. However, most Tesla bears AGREE that Tesla cars are darned good. Tesla bears feel that Tesla is extremely unlikely to achieve a profit level that  supports a market cap of nearly $60 billion. I don't dislike Tesla, I think EV cars will become mainstream over the next decade or two. As Montana stated, even if you are bullish enough to predict Tesla WILL reach all its production goals and gross margin predictions, the stock is still wildly overvalued.  Tesla cult investors could easily keep the stock price puffed up for another year or so, but I agree with Montana that the almost inevitable correction in Tesla stock is probably coming sooner than that.",

"I would make the same argument to Tesla Bears that I made to Netflix Bears at $83 (where I bought it):  your arguments about Tesla fundamentals are precisely correct, but not relevant as long as the stock trades on momentum and the story.  Sometime in the future - which gets closer every day - Tesla's fundamentals will matter to the stock price.  On that day, if Tesla has fulfilled Mr. Musk's promise to be profitable ""any day now"" first made years ago, the stock price will be fine.  On the other hand, if losses are still counted in the billions of dollars, the stock will be valueless.  No one can say when this day might arrive.Tesla in a race with it's stock price's momentum/story.

"Another excellent piece.  Thank you for writing and posting it, and for the links to other pieces, as well.My only fear in shorting TSLA is the Government factor.  I believe one reason TSLA stock is not already under $200 is because they are getting help from the Government, who is interested in their technologies.  Hey, who owns Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, where the ""Falcon Heavy"" lifted of from?  And one does not launch the second most powerful rocket after the great Saturn V without a little advice and consent from Your Government.Having said that, it is not too late to short TSLA via options or shorting the stock.  I prefer options myself, and long dated ones to mitigate the theta factor.  Some might want to consider put spreads to mitigate some of the expense.I sold my previous put positions at a good profit after the recent ""crash"" and TSLA dipping beneath $300.

"@Montana   -  Always enjoy your insight.  To me, the biggest Elephant in the room is the free supercharging.  I estimate it costs TSLA 200 Million Dollars a year to operate their Superchargers. By their own estimates, it costs 1/3 the price of traditional fuel to charge a Tesla.   Since the average person spends $2,250.00 per year on fuel, that means that TSLA has to spend about $840.00 per year for fuel alone (Per Tesla).  Since all TSLA owners do not use the network I adjusted my estimate to account for those that charge at home.  Why do they still give away free fuel?  I thought Feb 1st was the cutoff?  I believe sales will fall off a cliff if they started charging all the owners for the cost of electricity alone.  Then, you also have maintenance costs, repairs, and rent.

"Elon Musk is a genius without doubt.  His problem is a lack of focus, self-discipline, modesty, steadfastness, and reliability.  That is why Tesla now is such a bungled mess.That plus the fact that electric cars, outside their inherent limitations, are a harebrained notion, the same as in 1912.  Yes, yes, EVs have advanced ""exponentially"" in the last hundred years, just as have ICE automobiles.  Any relative gain in practicality by EVs since then comes solely from today's ubiquity of electric power.  But that facilitates ICEVs too, by enabling fuel stations with shops and restaurants open 24 hours along every highway from coast to coast.EVs are more costly to build, with no denying.  They are notoriously short-ranged even on ideal dry mild days over level roads.  The best contrary arguments for EVs point to future, i. e. nonexistent gains in efficiency and charging infrastructure, regardless of its cost.  The usual arguments are based on emotions and insults.Now electric cars can have practical uses for some owners.  They are as free to judge and choose for themselves as are we.  But speaking of EVs as ""the future"" when they are barely part of the present is nonsense for the above reasons plus this:  Tomorrow's cars and trucks must transport the same weight and bulk of passengers and cargo as today's.  For this we can expect gradual gains in energy efficiency but no quantum gain in any one form.",

"Investors should google ‘size of skin burn market.” Various market research firms claim the global market is $1.67 billion as of 2016, growing to $2.3-$2.8 billion by 2025; not the $45 billion claimed by RCAR. We all know statistics can be made to fit any position. Presumably, stem cell mists will be a replacement for skin grafts in certain but not all burn cases. I don’t know what goes into those market estimates, such as hospital overhead, doctor and staff costs, salves , bandages, insurance, etc. Without clarity from RCAR as to the breakdown of the burn-related market, it would appear that the market for their applicator is dramatically smaller than at least I thought. Having a market cap of half a billion dollars, no meaningful amount of cash or employees, likely intending to license manufacturing their product but not knowing what alternative applicators will come along in next few years, you have to give this stock a hard look. If FDA approved and applicator sold to a large medical equipment company, will proceeds be distributed to shareholders or used for another company. Since one shareholder controls over 50% ownership, based in Canada, one has to question, particularly if true that the parent company has tried several unrelated businesses in the past. I have no reason to doubt the product claims but it seems shareholders are quite vulnerable to far less than the 10-fold claim in the promotional material on the web. So, we have a known short seller with published record on one side providing considerable background information and many but not all unsubstantiated claims on the other. The company has made a categorical denial of claims but provided nothing of substance. Until market size for the applicator specifically is better defined, I think buyers at price are quite vulnerable to disappointment.",

"Contrary to the author's contention, it is an extremely positive sign that IPIX is moving to an oral formulation for their ovarian cancer trial rather than an intravenous method. IPIX's management has shown time after time that they protect the shareholders' interests by being frugal with their clinical trials, so that their resources are used extremely efficiently. The Kevetrin trial has now shown via biopsy that the drug does modulate p53 in the tumor (p53 malfunctions are indicated in about half of all cancers). Intravenous dosing is inconvenient and difficult to administer multiple times a day (if that turns out to be the best dosing schedule). Oral formulation is easy and convenient for the patient. Why should the company waste resources and inconvenience the patients in the clinical trial, if that is not to be the ultimate form of the drug? What would be gained by pursuing a clinical trial for a formulation that would not be used, instead of a clinical trial for the formulation that WOULD be used?IPIX is showing its confidence in the drug by pursuing development of an oral form, and changing the focus of the drug trials to the version that would ultimately be used by patients. This is a positive development, not a negative one.Given that IPIX also has two other drugs which have been successful in clinical trials, the very low market cap of this stock represents a compelling buying opportunity in my opinion (which of course is my opinion and not investment advice).IPIX's other drugs are Brilacidin, for multiple indications including an oral rinse for chemo/radiation induced oral mucositis, for which there is no effective preventive drug or good treatment), and Prurisol (for psoriasis).",

"MGL-3196 seems to work by enhancing LDL-C uptake via the β-selective thyroid hormone receptor in the liver.  As such it enhances bile acid production/excretion which (unfortunately) mostly gets recycled into the blood LDL-C pool.

Don't know the (prospective) cost of MGL-3196, but, if expensive (likely?), it may defeat its success, as statin-ezetimibe combos alone have proven pretty effective on their own.

On the other side of the spectrum, anyone with a balance of $50 gets at least 100 shares.I am predicting that this offering will be way over subscribed.   If I am correct Tier 2 gets zero.   Allocations are spelled out in the prospectus based upon shares requested and balances and what not.Sometime this week, Sandler will let us know how many shares will be allocated based upon those June 30, 2016 balances.    Some are hopeful that there will be at least 1 share for each dollar on deposit on that date.Lots of guessing but nobody really knows.   We'll wait and see.Also uncertain is the ""pop"" that will occur.   Some think $3.  Others think more.   This offering is so big that index funds will likely have to buy it though I am uncertain what their purchase requirements might be.   So bottom line on this:  There are two great unknowns.   Allocations and pop.   And anyone who says that they know what either one will be doesn't know anything.",
Just got letter confirming my request for shares - and they would let me know my allocation in future!,
"Allocations for Tier One have not yet come out.   The one thing for certain is that nobody knows anything at this time other than the folks at Sandler.   Trading is scheduled for the 17th--so we should hear something this week absent a delay.I would be shocked beyond any comprehension if anyone in Tier 2 gets a single share.   This is--by far--the most attractive conversion deal that has taken place in many years.   There is pent up demand for those who have played this game for decades who were waiting for a big one like this to come in.Though it's a $500MM deal it is far, far more likely that this is way over subscribed.   The bigger question is not whether Tier 2 gets any shares because I think the chances of that are about the same as Trump appointing Biden as his Secretary of State.   No, the bigger question is what kind of allocations those in Tier 1 will receive.    Speculation abounds as to whether the ratio will exceed more than one share per dollar on June 30, 2016 deposit.   Those who insist on guessing fear that it will be less than that.Bottom line:  If all you have is Tier 2 go open an account at Spencer and hope that they don't file for an IPO until 2020.",

The vote for the foundation is April 5.   Guy Malaby doesn't think trading will occur for a week after that--and maybe longer.They are only legally compelled to pay interest at a rate of their savings account which is only a step above nothing.   A month's interest spread on this amount of money is substantial.   I would guess that they are not compelled to break Usain Bolt's speed record for coming to the gate.Usually allocations are announced just prior to the trading.,
Anyone know when we’ll find out about allocations?,
"Look at the Ponce DeLeon bank.  PDLB.   That was the last MHC.  (PCSB was a standard conversion and it didn't count because all the shares were traded at that offering.)  PDLB is a fraction of the size and makes diddly squat.  CLBK?  Five billion dollar banks don't grow on trees.   They have an ROE of 6.   Compare those numbers to PDLB.   Now, to be fair, PDLB came out at at 75 TBV while CLBK is coming out at something closer to 82.    Hence, it is more richly priced.     But this will be a ""must have"" for many a fund.    This will come down to how big your deposit was on June 30, 2016.   I wouldn't expect a full allocation unless you had a hefty deposit on that date--and I'm guessing something like $50K.   If you aren't a Tier One depositor you might as well stop considering.   And if you don't know what a Tier One depositor is and how this plays out you are in over your head.",

My worst investment ever!!!,
Also it’s PRB property may have some me upside.  The value of the acreage in that basin has increased quite significantly recently.  Is there any expert around who can give us some insight?,
But you can’t assume these are liabilities at face value.  They are commitments.,
"Let’s start debating what really matters - I did a very rough estimate of CHK’s worth: Macellus ($5-7bn), Utica ($2bn), Eagle Ford ($5bn), mid-conn ($2bn), Haynesville ($3bn), PRB($1bn), shares in midstream($0.5bn). Total is about 18-20bn. It’s total liability is about $13bn ($10bn debt +$1.7bn pref shares + 1.2bn NWC). So the net worth of the company is about $5-7bn, 2-3 times of its current market value. The company does seem most undervalued vs. it’s peers. I understand there is the reason behind it. But it does seem that it will have the most upside potential if market recovers",
"It’s getting rather tiresome listening to all the reasoning behind the bearish sentiment when not a single bear, or bull, has even tried to put together a reasonable estimate of the value of the company’s assets. I can tell you this, though, it is far north of the book value that the bears like to point to when making their ridiculous arguments. So until this as discussed, all of their other arguments are just noise.",
"So ... assuming the proceeds from the sale of FTS are included in 4Q cash flow #s, recurring cash flow is more like $400 mm vs. $525 mm in CAPEX, or negative FCF of $125 mm?  And the $2 B in cash flow this year will result in flat production y-o-y?  Those #s and the 30+% PD decline that CHK has previously referenced (which will likely go up due to new drilling), appear to show a co. that must reinvest all cash flow to keep production constant, and in doing so, has no net cash to reduce debt.  The $500 mm in sales will obviously reduce cash flow by $60-80 mm annually.  The debt spiral remains locked in place.",
Thanks for another great piece! Very timely for investors checking on CHK.,
I don’t know that CHK can ever be saved. It’s a shame this once great company has been reduced to this.,

"tmpw1 you are right the equity per share doesn't drop normally but since  the looter sold to private parties 60 percent below net value of a share  the equity per share dropped dramatically.The analyst had already calculated the real market  prices of vessels such as TUDOR .After calculating each vessel   with current market value they came to a liquidation of 5 dollars a share.The looter ignored this and sold to her cronies with a 60 percent less than that.If a company's share price was 20 two years ago and in between if the company didn't lose a penny from operations how can you  explain this.In the last quarter NMM generated 27 million dollar free cash and id didn't need any capital raise at all.Sometimes the stock market doesn't appreciate the real value of the stock and in a similar case TNP criticized the market but didn't  issue shares and waited ,consequently in four months the stock price went up three hundred percent.Would it have been better if she massacred the shareholder value and enriched the managers.I watch GNK they are very careful,SBLK very careful,SB very very careful,Only a couple shippers are looting shareholder value.Nobody blames GNK  managers for the disaster ,they were overburdened by debt and they went bankrupt.That is another issue.A.F. doesn't care about double entry bookkeeping,the only thing interests her is robbery.I am hundred percent sure that if the small shareholders jointly file a petition with F.B.I.They will immediately charge her with fraud since all her public offerings are done with private parties.If she is charged with fraud all her transactions will be scrutinized  and she might lose all her assets.Some may return to NMM and NMM stock might go back to at least 8 dollars a share since A.F. ruined NMM by 500 to 600 million dollars.",

On this score I didn't like the huge $30 million impairment charge on one ship last quarter. Why was the carrying value so high prior to the write down - that's an awful lot for one ship and makes you wonder about the borrowing base calculation. In fact the $30 million write down is about the same as NMM just raised on a net basis. How accurate is the rest of the balance sheet I wonder.",

Using excess cash for dropdowns from NM creates more management fees and changes an illiquid asset into cash.

If they pay down debt or buy back shares, NMM's stock price should appreciate. Is there any difference between selling some appreciated stock or receiving dividends. I have an example: in 2009 ACAS, a business development entity decided to not pay any dividends. ARCC, a similarly situated entity, continued to pay dividends while ACAS bought back stock and reduced leverage. By the time ARCC bought ACAS in 2017, ACAS had appreciated by over 400% versus 100% for ARCC. I'll take the 400%.",

You can go into immense detail about the merits of NMM and its low stock price which JM has done very well and I agree with him but I am coming around to the opinion that none of that actually matters if NMM continues to suffer from a ""buyers' strike"". And while I have heard good opinions of why this is is so, I have yet to hear a good opinion of why this will change and absent a decent dividend if the stock price doesn't appreciate then what's the point of being long this stock? In theory it should have appreciated along with all the company specific actions last year and along with the strength of the BDI last year but in practice it is back to where it was a year ago. A good dividend would provide a proper catalyst but I don't believe a buyback will. Disappointing, but I think management performance over time is a much bigger factor than most analysts realize and TK is another case in point - it should go up and stay up but there's always something that drags it back down and gains evaporate despite business conditions improving.",

"ALT Perspective, the thing you don't really address here in a rebuttal is the marking to market of BABA's public holdings. Whether revenue growth is overstated or not, I don't particularly care. The thing that makes this uninvestable for me is that they're holding things like AliPictures at DOUBLE the publically listed market value for years. They're not just doing this with one thing, they're doing it with almost every public holding they have. I don't care whether IFRS allows write-ups and then no writedowns (I don't believe it does allow this one sided treatment), it is disingenuous accounting to mark something up based on public securities price appreciation and then fail to mark it down when it's traded below your high mark for 3 or 4 years. This dynamic is made worse when they do what they did last quarter in marking up an asset to cover up a mark down. That is managing earnings to the tune of billions of dollars, and is another sign of how this management team massages the numbers to tell the story it wants to. BABA's flywheel is to generate cash from operations, and reinvest that in all sorts of businesses (to control a piece of everything, as someone said in the comments above), as illustrated by the massive growth in investments on its balance sheet. If the treatment of public holdings is as it has been, then how can we have any confidence in the rest of their holdings where you can't see what is going on? If we can't have confidence in the rest of their holdings, then what is the actual value of that free cash flow they're reinvesting. $1 of free cash flow invested in something that goes to $0.50 is worth a lot less than $1. We need that cash flow to grow; that's the entire point of reinvestment. If BABA's investment track record is or will be spotty, it reduces the value of each dollar of cash flow it reinvests, which reduces the value of the company itself. I don't know if BABA is a $0, but to me, it's completely uninvestable. Investing in a Chinese VIE as a western investor is bad enough (and those that do likely have no understanding of the actual legal recourse they have, history of foreign investor abuses etc.), but investing in one that has this glaring issue with their accounting and earnings massaging is quite another story. Shorting isn't about necessarily proving everything; Chanos didn't know Enron was a fraud. He believed it was likely to be one based on a number of inferences and signs in their financial statements. BABA has some of the same signs, and it may or may not be a fraud. I have no stake in the matter, but to not see what is plainly there in my view, and ignore things like jurisdictional risk is folly in my view.",

Interesting until you read DeepThroat's article and your blood runs cold.........Old saying if it seems too good to be true.......,
Thanks for the calm and data/chart based rebuttal. I'm long and recently increased my stake in BABA.,
"Good article. I also long BABA since it was $80 a share,  I have been adding to it.It is the only stock that I am still making money in the deep. Is also the one I invested most amount of money. I trust that in the near future it will be rising to $300 a share. Your thoughts?",
"Great article!  What the blogger failed to realize that if baba was an accounting fraud, then why did they miss badly on earnings.

I agree with most of these comments here - watching baba for the past couple of years. American investors have not warmed up to this stock no matter what  how good the fundaments are. Great article.,
"Here is my 2 cents on this. BABA seems to ""mimic"" companies in the US, Amazon reports stellar growth in cloud revenue, BABA follows suit. Amazon moves a bit toward retail, BABA follows suit, Amazon buys a grocery store, guess what BABA does? I think it was a year ago, maybe 2016.. anyway i remember the big singles day celebration BABA had and there was Joe and Ma sitting on a stage looking and pointing at their cell phones giggling to each other at the ""amazement"" of sales. Facebook just reported very high mobile user growth, guess what BABA reported the very next quarter? It was also this same singles day that there was a single sentence on a press release and was never mentioned again. It stated how Alibaba sold 1 billion dollars worth of automobiles, then claimed it sold more cars on singles day than all the dealerships in china do in a month, I want to say it was 3 months but I just don't remember, but it was some crazy stat like that. I can't find the PR, but I do remember reading it and waiting for some mention of it on a quarterly or some other pumping PR, which never came. I find that incredibly surprising, particularly when BABA has since invested in giant car vending machines. With that said, I wish BABA longs a nice long and prosperous investment! I will remain skeptical that an individual who was unable to get a job at KFC, somehow made it to Washington State, viewed the internet and then created one of the largest most profitable companies in China with a 1/10th of the workforce of Amazon, the need to constantly raise US dollars to fund acquisitions in China (of which BABA does most all their business in yuan, yet the loan happy Chinese banks aren't lined up at BABA's door to get a piece of this amazingly profitable pie for some reason???) dresses up and tries to dance like Michel Jackson during a BABA event and would rather be remembered as a ""tai chi"" master (he isn't) rather than the mastermind behind China's crown jewel of Alibaba and employing 50k Chinese citizens.. I wish you luck.",
"Yes, analysts can give their opinions but these should be mainly based on the facts and logic. Unfortunately, many articles about BABA are full of bias, especially the “home country bias”. But still thanks to this home country bias and thus the discounted price, real long-time and strategic investors have better opportunities to earn profits. A key point from Ray Dalio’s book and his success is “radically open-minded”; but most people don’t have.",
"Any company could be misrepresenting their numbers, and if so, I guess no investments are ever ""worth the risk"". Of course that's preposterous. Is it more likely for a Chinese company than an American to lie? Perhaps. But in this case, I think it is highly unlikely for two reasons. The gov't in China wants its economic reputation to grow until it is on par with  Western nations. It has a ways to go. I'm sure it closely watches large companies in China who have the potential to tarnish that image. You might even say the gov't has a vested interest in ""helping"" such companies, as they represent the kind of success story they'd like to continue duplicating, helping them to achieve stated goal.  Of course Western gov't ""help"" their big industries too, so this is not a trick of the Communists. It good business sense. So I feel Alibaba's two boogeymen (gov't interference and fraud) are longshots at best. Lastly, stating that just because a company is large, and there is a lot of money to lose it's risky is absurd. You mean it would be ok for an investor to lose all his money in a small enterprise, but not a big one, because he'd lose a lot? All is all.  Besides, large entities get a lot more leniency and term extensions from banks than smaller entities, because the banks themselves have a lot to lose in a failure. I am long BABA because they are a juggernaut in a juggernaut economy that has a long way to run.",
"Well, you kinda helping them spreading out the words. I don't even know such article exists until I read your response, but honestly if you don't live in China, you have no idea how BABA influences your daily life in every aspect. Long BABA",

"Thank you for posting such an enlightened and informative article. I am long Baba, but there are two reasons, in my opinion, that cause many of my investor peers to shun Baba and focus instead on Amzn (despite Baba’s superior fundamentals): 1. A mistrust of Chinese companies, in general, and as mentioned by other writers and (2) the fact that foreign investors don’t actually own equity in Alibaba, but because of the VIE corporate structure, have only an interest in the future cash flows of a separate company. This is a non starter and a huge risk  for many investors as they believe that the Chinese government could pull the plug on VIE structures at any point in time.",

Excellent article. Find there is always an ulterior motive. Always have to ask the why question. Long BABA.,
"Deep Throat IPO has been writing about BABA for quite some time and has made a number of observations that serious investors should consider.   I find this rebuttal not convincing at all.  The core concern is that BABA is not being transparent about all sorts of things that would make it much easier for investors to analyze the business.  If they are so sophisticated with all their big data analysis why not provide more information to investors?  Complexity, lack of transparency are the hallmarks associated with securities fraud.   This fraud typically has at its core something that is generally believable which is how people get suckered into believing things are better than they really are.  Enron was certainly in the energy trading business and making money on certain aspects of their business.  They were also hiding debt and playing all sorts of accounting games to make the business look far more profitable than it really was.  The more I look the more I believe that BABA is not nearly as profitable as they claim to be.   The market cap today is based on assumptions of profitability that are probably unwise. Given the 450 Billion market  cap this that the potential to be one of the largest financial meltdowns in history.    When perceptions change to the negative it can happen REALLY fast, must faster than people expect.   That is what makes this such an interesting story to follow.   Deep throat deserves our thanks and praise for taking the time to read the details and exposure the concerns to a larger audience so we can find out what really is happening.   Transparency is the best disinfectant.",

I especially got a chuckle out of the suggestion that Jack and Co have pivoted into shifting old 747s and second-hand super yachts in such numbers that would explain the incredible YoY revenue growth. I think this rebuttal only serves to strengthen Mr DeepThroat's work.",
"""total revenue growth excluding Cainiao was 14 percent YoY while the core commerce revenue growth would have been 49 percent YoY.""Let's be clear on what Maggie Wu, BABA's CFO, was trying to say. Total revenue growth would have been ""14% less than"" the 56% reported for total revenue growth if Cainiao had been excluded. This does not mean that BABA's total revenue growth was only 14% if Cainiao is excluded. Ergo, total BABA revenue growth without Cainiao was 42%.(56% - 14%= 42%)It is true that BABA's total ""Core Commerce"" revenue growth would have been 49% and not the 57% reported if Cainiao had been excluded. However, it is proper to include Cainiao's revenue since a controlling interest by BABA was finally reached in Cainiao in mid October 2017. This is in accordance with GAAP.",

"Supporting the retail side is where Amazon learns and perfects its other businesses.  They first launched Cloud Computing to support the retail side of Amazon.  Now that business has over 50% of market share and the government is only now starting to move to the cloud in any meaningful way.  Over the next 2 to 3 years, the gov taps will open wide and more and more of the cloud computing business will flow to AWS.  (Believe me I know, I work in the field.  AWS is so far ahead of its competitors.  MSFT and GOOG will eventually catch up, but right now Azure seems really complex to me compared to AWS and the superb documentation that AWS provides makes them my first choice in any situation).  Warehouse Robotics:   Amazon bought out the right companies and is the leader in warehouse robotics at this time.  Delivery Service:  Amazon has been testing out its service and will soon launch its package delivery service (also competing with FedEx and UPS in the process).  Add in the delivery drone experiment, and this could be very interesting.  I see Amazon as the sum of all its parts.  It may end up spinning off a whole lot of companies eventually.  Even if you think AMZN is overvalued, think about this.  Qualcomm went from about $2-3 per share to $100 per share in the space of one year when it peaked.  Amazon has barely moved using that scale.  And it is one of the stocks showing the most strength in face of a weakening market.  Today the CPI was higher than expected.  0.5 actual compared to 0.3 expected.  Volatility in the market should resume.",

"@author, thanks for your painstaking, accurate, and relevant analysis of AMZN Financials.  Your data are the very reason, I bailed out of my AMZN investments (profitably), as I was getting concerned about a dot.com experience.  No question, Jeff Bezos is as sharp as a tack, a motivational CEO, and one of the world's greatest salesman.  But in the end it's all about the Financials, where, more than 20 years after AMZN's founding, AWS still remains its only profitable department.  Kudos again for your insightful article!",

"The deception is using the leases as an element for the bear thesis. These leases are on the balance sheet, people who know how to read it can see it is not a problem if they are put in the capex or in the operating cash flow, it is irrelevant.

You hit the nail on the head. Especially the treatment of capital leases.,
"Dave:Thank you for a solid analysis.  I have long held that AMZN is essentially a logistics play, enter where you can get between the layers and take them out with ""improved"" service.  Keep doing this over and over.  That becomes growth!  BUT, as you point out, investors will expect you to make money, at some point.  Others have pointed out that they are using USPS, and some claim that USPS losses would be greater if not for AMZN business, but I haven't seen a worthwhile analysis to justify that POV.  And AMZN seems to use USPS for final mile of delivery, at least in my area.  Perhaps at some increments USPS doesn't have to add carriers, etc.  but again, I haven't seen that analysis, so think AMZN is simply short-term cherry picking.  Others have observed that 2 days has become 3, as have I.  Maybe they are testing revenue elasticity, or maybe responding to their real cost of delivery?  Meanwhile, AMZN is 'searching' for a location for a second hq.  My money is on the DC area so Mr. Bezos can have his lobbyists very close to those they need most to influence to continue growth while bleeding cash.",

"""The interesting question for me is, what would AMZN's sales look like if it charged for delivery on all Prime-related sales under $50.""Dave, AMZN does charge for shipping on Prime Priced items, it is included in the price.Example - Pulley Bearing that I needed for my 2006 VW for preventive maintenance I will be installing this Spring.   AMZN Prime price $15.96, same exact bearing on EBay $8.81, free shipping. I am not concerned that it is not at my door in 2 days, I saved $7.15 and got it in 4 days. I find this all the time, AMZN PRIME free shipping is not free, you pay for it twice, membership fee and higher prices.",
Same as it ever was.They have been raising the commissions on marketplace merchants relentlessly for years.It will collapse.  The only question is when.,
"Thanks for the article.  Amazon has never bothered to show that they were making money - the whole focus is on growth at all costs.  It is difficult to get a true handle on the company because they are involved in so many businesses: retail, wholesale, cloud, streaming, electronics (ebook reader, voice-activated assistant, etc.) and so compete with Walmart, Microsoft & Google, Netflix, etc.Ever since my wife and I joined Prime 2 years ago, we rarely shop in a B&M store any more.  More recently, I have noticed that I can now purchase nearly all the specialty vitamins that I used to get from Vitacost, directly from Amazon, and with much faster delivery.  So Amazon is not just taking on B&M retailers, they are also taking on other .com retailers.  With  ""growth at any cost"", Amazon is out to put other retailers (B&M and online) out of business.  As the retail shakeout continues, Amazon will continue to get stronger.  Eventually, they will start turning a profit, but it is not a priority for them right now.Based on the technical indicators, I think that Amazon is still a bit overpriced and should be priced at around $1250 but the market thinks it is worth more and so the current price is much higher.",

"Another outstanding analysis by Kranzler.  I am a fan of Amazon prime and appreciate the free two day shipping! At the right price ($50/share?), I'd consider going long.Eventually value will matter again, and when it does, there is a high probability that Walmart (profitable), Google (profitable), etc will find AMZN's weak point and reduce prices - whether that is in the AWS arena or Alexa-type devices - remains to be seen.The market will turn when it turns, I guess.  We will see what the next downturn brings.",

"Kudos to Dave Kranzler for deconstructing the dishonesty of the Amazon financials. Amazon is already more overvalued than Cisco was in 1999, and that is saying something.",
I must say that in the last six months I've noticed an improvement in Walmart pricing compared to Amazon for same or comparable items. No annual fee and free shipping over  $30 is enticing for a cost sensitive consumer not to mention free shipping of anything to the store of your choice. Will be interesting to watch the competition for our disposable income.,
"Thanks to the author for his truth telling and good insight regarding AMZN's accounting distortions. Looking ahead to the next recession, the company will encounter difficulties, based on over-expansion of the cloud sector among all providers, that I think will destroy Amazon's earnings. In a cash flow crisis, where will they stop the bleeding? Cutting back international sales? What would that do to revenues and the stock's ""moxie""? Meanawhile, I suspect the home builders' stocks are trapped, because interest rates want to climb and have a long way to go. I think the Fed actually is taking back reserves and very modest taking to date reflects the lumpiness of the process. But even if they just stop reserve growth, rates need to climb. The builders collapsed from a very rapid runup just as rates were also jumping to new high ground. If long T bond rates fall, it will be because stocks get hammered (or later, from recession), in which case homebuilders will fall too. If the boom continues another year, rates will climb from here, choking back homebuilder revenues, while their costs keep marching higher.",

For Amazon build a product ad every month on the website call it R&D, Walmart puts out a print ad it goes to operations/marketing.

"Lots of good pro and con comments in this thread.Here is how I would evaluate the proposed trade. If one believes that AAPL represents a good long-term investment at current prices, then it represents a fantastic long-term investment at a net price of $126 (net of option premium) if one is assigned shares. The return calculations I would use for the option are the following: 1) 17.5% annualized return on margin (assuming 20% margin); and 2) 5.3% annualized return on risk capital.Bottom line, if one believes that AAPL represents a god long-term investment at current  prices AND has the capital (and knowledge of options), this represents an attractive trade. Stated differently, if someone offered you $400 today to buy 100 shares of AAPL from them at $130, would you take it? However, selling a naked put does not allow an investor to participate on the upside, so selling a put and buying a call (as the author suggests) would make more sense. It really comes down to one's perspective on how AAPL will perform over the next seven months.",

"SteadyOption mentioned selling options closer to ATM. That is the way to go.Selling the OTM options only look good from the perspective of return on margin capital.It stinks from an absolute return on capital basis. In order to compensate,you have to sell more OTM options,increasing leverage to get an acceptable return on capital being managed.The simple question is would you rather be short 3 OTM options for the same ""dollars"" as 1 ATM. Only you can decide that,and its a function of your appetite for risk",

"Covered calls and cash-secured puts may have the same market risk profile, but I use them for quite different reasons.  I've found that sold options are the perfect tool for generating income and just as importantly to me, for portfolio balancing and volatility taming.  Calls are used for generating cash and reducing risk.  Puts are used for generating cash and increasing market exposure.I've had no problems with selling options in my retirement accounts at Fidelity and Ameritrade.",
"Last year, selling AAPL puts worked out tremendously for me but I found out that if the market were to crash, I'd burn pretty badly. Let's say AAPL price crashes to 100 while you sold puts at $130. Now you have to buy the shares at $130 at a 30% premium and all you got was a lousy $4 per share in premiums to make up for it.

Apparently, Tesla Grohmann has designed a production line... in Germany ... tested ... working spectacularly... it’s expected to be three times as productive...And within days had to issue a clarification as to what they might or might not have meant by this in terms of actually producing 5K cars per month. The clarification didn't actually give dates, numbers, etc. This isn't ""coy,"" this is ""evasive.""They were asked twice about production and delivered a huge steaming pile of obfuscation.2.

"I have to laugh at anyone dumb enough to quote Catherine Wood as an expert. Wood is almost completely ignorant about the electric automotive scene in general , and Tesla in particular, which, for some unknown reason, she believes is ushering in some sort of sea change on the basis of technology. I've got news for  Clueless Catherine : Tesla has no technology anyone else would want, and whenone makes silly claims about autonomous driving, there are half a dozen automakers/tech shops, whose autonomous driving capabilities are light years ahead of Tesla. And if Catherine thinks Tesla has some sort of technological advantage with respect to batteries, she is likewise at sea - the CCS charging protocol has been adopted by almost all automakers and will be the universal standrad, NOT Tesl's'a now second rate Supercharger protocol. CCS is twice as fast as the Superchargersand are being deployed by an automaker consortium (Ionity) , charging companies (like evGO) and oil companies (like Royal Dutch Shell) even before there are CCS vehicles on the road capable of using their full charging rates.  TO further the lack of credibility of Catherine Woods, I note that she predicts a stock price of $4,000 for Tesla. Just how dumb is that? Tesla's semi truck, which has apparently impressed analysts by garnering a couple hundred pre-orders, while there are half a dozen wlll established truck companies, with dealership and service locations and loyal customers around the world, ready to roll out their electric semis before  Tesla can, assuming Tesla can figure out how to build the vehicle. One company alone has cut off pre-orders for their electric semi, at 8,000!!!  Tesla's loss of their $7500 tax credit per car will end sometime this year, placing Tesla in an impossible situation - facing hundreds of electric competitors from companies far more talented that they are , and all sporting a $7500 price advantage.

"Let's address these - ""Three frequent arguments levied against Tesla are: 1) it will run out of cash, 2) it will never be profitable, and 3) it is currently overvalued relative to even an optimistic forecast of its future profits.""1) It's necessary to look at the other side of the balance sheet, too.  CCE Q4 2017 vs Q4 2016 is down, while liabilities have skyrocketed.  The company has negative net working capital.  We don't know the company's exact cash position today, but can see that if Tesla were to pay its Q4 AP, cash is then less than $1B.  There's a reason Elon thanked their suppliers by giving them a shout out on the conference call... That isn't even mentioning other current liabilities and the apparent inventory build.  The point is that the company's cash position is likely much less rosy than described in this article.2) That's a big unknown and it doesn't appear that the company will be profitable in the foreseeable future.  Didn't Elon say something along the lines of 'no profits before 2020?'3) The lady in that video is off her rocker.  Tesla isn't selling software as a service.  They are in a capital-intensive manufacturing (and distribution, in their case) business, where operating income margins are less than 10% and huge unit volume is necessary to get there.  In her defense, her ETF fund probably has to buy companies like Tesla to be fully invested given size of the fund and their charter.  It would make sense for her to publicly defend their position, although I don't see her points as valid.  So, yes, if Tesla successfully executes its best-case scenario, it is still overvalued based on a present-value of those hypothetical profits someday.",

To be sure, aspects of the technology are new. There are new challenges to be faced. But Musk’s approach seems slipshod. How can too-soon-out-door manufacturing mistakes readily be fixed ex post?  Tesla doesn’t have a phalanx of independent dealers to cushion the complaints and solve them one by one. Today’s manufacturers face auto lemon laws, an aggressive tort bar, and a SEC that Henry Ford and Alfred P.  Sloan never imagined. Lemon law problems, for example, must generally be solved in a specific finite period or the manufacturer faces fairly stringent penalties.  So while Tesla hired seasoned auto veterans, they still seems stuck in the starting gate well after the race has begun. Their vaunted lead in autonomous driving seems to have vanished. They are suddenly facing competition from many different sides. Other producers are reducing range anxiety too. And, there are now several competing auto manufacturers who will tap into government subsidy gravy train pushing battery driven electric motors and dilute Tesla’s first-mover advantage. A Tesla is not an iPhone. Software updates that work as intended are one thing but software glitches are another. The complexity of software solutions to problems can easily be overwhelming. Humans still have arms and hands so what’s the point of pushing the software solutions far beyond mechanical solutions for opening the rear doors in a Model 3? If you’ve ever been so unlucky to have driven a car with underlying electrical problems, you know how unpleasant and dangerous that experience can be when the wiring stops working. The key to Apple’s success has always centered around simplicity and ease of use. I much prefer interacting with my intuitively simple controls on Apple Car Play than the comparable native controls on my Mercedes. The native controls tend to be too complicated to master than those of Apple. So that’s the chore I’d rather have Apple solve rather than Tesla but I doubt Tesla will give me that opportunity: At Tesla, Elon appears to know best. The trouble is that he really doesn’t and isn’t smart enough to admit it. He seems to be both incredibly stubborn, yet at the same time, “spread too thin.” I tend to admire stubbornness. Very often that is a very admirable trait for those anxious to change the status quo. Be persistent. But Elon prefers jumping from A to B to ...Z, leaving many problems unresolved along the way. A Tesla bull might say he’s all over the map, a one-man technological genius. But I am afraid a more accurate description is slipshod and childish. That’s Elon’s problem and those who have invested in the quixotic Teslarian future.",
"""If production were further delayed, Tesla may have more Model S and X leases it could securitize as a source of cash.""  In other words, give up future earnings from these leases in exchange for discounted cash up front.  Yet you are positive on profitability. ""Alternatively, Tesla can always issue more shares.""  Possibly, but this would dilute.  Yet you are positive on profitability.  Lastly, Elon did not play ""coy"" with M-3 production numbers.  He hedged and fudged and obfuscated, then added a ""clarification.""  LOL.  I traded my 1/19 calls for 1/20 calls (strike at 200 and 210).  Tesla is going down.  Just a matter of when.....",
"basically if you're investing in tesla at this point it's on the hope spaceX will buy it, which may very well happen, but if that is the case, Elon has to be fired as CEO and perhaps be kept on as a robotics engineer, you can't bankrupt this many companies and not change the leadership",

"I agree with one of your statements - in 2019 opinions re Tesla will be converging. I suspect you and I don't agree at all about the convergence point, but hey. To each his own.Regarding cash, no one can plausibly make the claim that Tesla's cash position is good because of the Q4 shift upward in current liabilities and shift downward in current assets. Negative by a billion dollars is not my idea of promising. The accounts payable/accounts receivable numbers are so disproportionate as to be deeply concerning. In addition the growing negatives on Services and other are a red flag to me. But I, at least, prefer to wait for the audited financials before delving much deeper. As for the idea that Tesla should be valued as a software company, if that is true for Tesla it is at least as true for the auto companies ahead of it in the self-driving race. Every three months that list gets longer. If you really believe that theory, then why aren't you arguing that all those other companies are deeply undervalued? Finally, you seem to be implicitly making the assertion that self-driving tech is really only associated with BEV vehicles. In fact the reverse is true; the power demands for real self-driving tech, to which Tesla is nowhere near, make true self-driving a better fit for ICE or hybrid vehicles.",

"""Imagine this hypothetical August 2019""""Although the bankruptcy proceedings begun July 1st are still on-going, we can already speculate on the primary causes that led to this condition:1.  Service centers swamped by the recall of Model S to fix design defects in power steering and suspension components are unable to service cars leading to owners frustration and multiple lawsuits and resulting collapse of Model S/X demand and used car values.2.  Class action lawsuits resulted in massive losses due to buybacks of Model S/X models when Tesla finally admitted that AP 2.5 HW is not capable of FSD.3.  Model 3 production stalled due to massive recall of all Model 3s following NHTSA determination that fatal crash of Model 3 into minivan with family of 5 was due to the Model 3 driver's distraction by having to use center display for a critical control in adverse weater conditions.4.

"Hello TrentI'd like to ask you a couple of questions:1) Given that you have always maintained such a positive and optimistic view of Tesla and its prospects, why is the outlook ""surprisingly good""?2) On November 6, in reference to your previous forecasts (that Model 3 deliveries would be ""a lot more than 2,000, as Morgan Stanley is predicting, or 2,025, as Goldman Sachs is predicting)  you wrote:“- - yup, this one is in my prediction tracker: https://seekingalpha.c... Don’t worry. When we get the final delivery count for 2017, I will revisit it and see how I did. I’ll write an article or blog post about it for sure and why I got it wrong (if I do get it wrong). I already think I was probably overconfident about that prediction. How about this. For every % I was off, I’ll donate a % of my earnings from that article to Cool Earth: http://bit.ly/2j4DnNY I predicted Tesla would deliver 18,000 more Model 3s than the 2,000 Wall Street was predicting at the time. So if Tesla delivers 2,000 Model 3s, I’ll donate 100% of my earnings. If Tesla delivers 11,000 Model 3s — 9,000 more than Wall Street predicted — I’ll donate 50% of my earnings.

"I am generally optimistic about Tesla, though the seas are rough.Some thoughts:>>Now the new lines just have to be shipped from Germany to Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, and installed. Not quite along the lines of ""Now we just have to point the Falcon Heavy upwards, set fire underneath and watch it fly"", but quite the nonchalant toss-off of a pretty significant task.  It's good that they've got it working.  It will got to the Gigafactory and it will work there, but...It's not exactly like throwing the thing in a FedEX envelope on one end and dumping it out on the other. It's a signficant task and things can go wrong.  The important thing is that they have a solution and it may be in place by the end of March.I'm far less impressed by the wonders of autonomous car sharing than, it seems, just about everybody.  I'm sure it will be a real thing and it will be fine -- especially in densely populated areas -- but it ignores an awful lot of reality that has more to do with people than with technology.  One thing that gets consistently glossed over is costs.  Proponents pretend that it will be cheaper than owning a car, but that's hard to see.  Things cost what they cost, regardless of how many people split the bill.  A car in constant use will require more frequent maintenance and wear out sooner than a car in occasional use.  Insurance for a shared car is likely to be higher -- especially insurance that covers the welfare of the car itself.  Mostly, though, it ignores today's realities:  there are ride-hailing services now.  There are ubers and Lyfts and, in the kind of places where autonomous ride-hailing might do best, taxis and buses and trains.  Some people in those buy cars anyway and likely will continue to do so.  People who don't won't, and won't make a difference in car buying patterns, either.The single biggest reason I am optimistic about Tesla is the cars themselves.  They make good cars.  I finally got the chance to see and sit in a Model 3 and I have to say, I'm excited to get one.  Much as I think the Bolt is a decent car, it doesn't make me want one.  The Model 3 does.When these cars get out in numbers, I think they will find a market.",
The main story of Q4 is that they generated a lot of cash by selling loads of inventory.  But look at those losses !!!!That strongly implies a that inventory was on the books at fraudulent values.  This was the great washout.  And so it will begins again.  Take in trades and hide the losses on the books as inventory until you decide to have another quarter when you paint the town.This company is fraudulent to the core.,

"Tesla did ""burn"" the cash last quarter, current assets (excluding cash) down $250 Million and Current Liabilities/Deferred Revenue up over a $1 Billion, yes they burned it in the quarter and will have to pay it out in the near future. Given long term debt up over $3.5 Billion last year and larger continuing losses, it will become harder and harder to finance this and equity raises will be more and more dilutive unless those passionate follows throw caution to the wind and buy new equity at higher and higher prices receiving lower and lower % ownership / more dilution. They not only need to raise money to replace what they have burned but also for capex further losses while they try to get their business running properly.What's more surprising is Revenue from both Energy Generation and Servies was down quarter over quarter but cost of these revenues was up, that is a scary trend for a ""growth"" company.Tesla better get its act together fast, start selling cars at reasonable margins or it will be one of the biggest business debacles in corporate history.I don't get how Tesla can be compared to a software company that has large gross profit margins when Tesla has small gross profit margins and little hope of even getting to a targeted 25% given increasing competition. Good software companies have gross margins of 2-3 times this amount.",

This whole transportation as a service and self driving justification for lunatic valuations is stupid. First her claims that people will pay several times the price for a vehicle that self drives and earns money while you’re not using it is a farce. The bulk of a persons driving needs occur at the same time I.e. rush hour. The idea that self driving will be the sole possession of one automaker is stupid too. Everyone has cruise control which is automatic throttle most everybody has an automatic braking system. Almost everybody has a self parking and lane assist so automatic control of steering so self driving will follow the path of navigation systems in cars terribly expensive and only in a few models and then availability will dramatically increase and the price will drop until it is like intermittent wipers on all cars.,

"There is a short game here and a long game. The short game is about who gets out of the starting gate with the most fizz and attracts the speculative money to bet on market volatility. For the long game one might ask “Which marijuana stock would Warren Buffet buy?”. I don’t want to speculate on the short run prospects. As an economist I want to focus on industry properties that will separate the “also rans” from the long run “winners”. Start at the beginning of the supply line, with the growing. The clear winners there are the supplies of inputs (hence  ETFs (TSX:HMMJ) (OTC:HMLSF with major presence of Miracle-Gro). The profits at the growing stage are likely to be meager for several reasons. There seem to be almost no barriers to entry, and no barriers to sourcing inputs. Contrast that with an Alberta dairy farmer selling cow’s milk, and who must own “Quota” (a permit to sell the milk). The current market cost/value of a permit is about $3,900 per milking cow, and a dairy farmer gets about 50% of the price of a liter of milk. In contrast, with no barrier to entry, the Canadian wheat farmer gets about 5-6% (12 cents) of the retail price of a loaf of bread. Grow operations are going to be more like wheat than milk. Look at the other end of the supply chain: consumer demand for cannabis. Divide those products into plain weed (smoke, home use, etc), consumables (baked goods, etc.), and medicinal products (cannabinoids, e.g. CBD). There are unlikely to be many profits in the sale of weed. The marijuana industry is Provincially regulated in Canada. Ontario is toying with a $10/gr market price yet a recent survey of 60,000 users reported an average street price of closer to $6/gr. This suggests that the regulated price will have to be less than $10/gr, with less government take than anticipated, and less profits in the supply chain. The impact on the illegal market may be dulled by higher legal prices. This leaves only three avenues for higher profit margins. They are consumables, medicinals, and our old friend “marketing”. The more refined the product, where quality is discernable, the better marketing works. The operative factors there are product differentiation and branding. Branding is intellectual property, it works in over-the-counter medications, and is a barrier to competition. For consumables who the winners are there is yet to be seen. Evidence from the U.S. suggests that consumables will account for the larger portion of the consumer dollar, again with very little going to the growers.For medicinals several factors are at play. For over-the-counter products quality and branding are important. For prescription products quality (dosage, etc.) is mandated by the authorities, with some products protected by patents. For medicinals branding plays a role but, more importantly, contracts with those who prescribe (hospitals, seniors’ facilities, etc) are important to guarantee the firm’s sustained demand. Lastly, there are the providers of associated services. The Ontario government has just signed with Shopify, an Ontario company, to handle Ontario’s online marijuana sales. So, is clear where the profits will be made, but unclear as to how much and who will be making them. It is hard to see this as a Golden Goose for government revenues. It is hard to see much in the way of profits at the “grow opp” stage. One is likely to see a weeding out (ho ho) of growers. There may be scope for a secondary market for grow permits that allows a small artisanal organic micro-grow sector to develop. The profits, large or small, are most likely to go to those with patents on mainly medicinal products; those with supplier contracts to institutions, including (as in Ontario) authorized sellers; as value-added profits to those producing consumables (local trendy bakery/coffee shop); and those who can combine branding with quality product. Other than those with patents and supplier contracts, it is hard to judge who will be the short run leads in this race for profits (and stock valuations). It may be easier to identify those with good long run prospects, those that would look good to the Warren Buffets of this world.",

They were around 9000 KG of licensed capacity before Cannimed and now they have 16000 KG. That puts them behind Organigram, which just announced licensed capacity of 16,500 KG.  Funded capacity is nice but remember that Aurora announced ground breaking ceremonies on 3 separate occasions. DELAY, DELAY , DELAY.  They have that huge shell at Aurora Sky, which impressed some people but that  is 10% of the work that needs to be done. No way they are done with it by Jan.1, 2019.

Corning sounds exciting at first glance and the company has great balance sheet. But I don't see much value in the stock on DCF basis. The dividend and buybacks are relatively small. Financial results fluctuate a lot. Looks like the company has to spend a lot to stay competitive. Would like to see lower level for entry.,
I bought more straight shares and 18 Jan 19 32 calls during the fire sale.I suspect once Valor glass kicks in and additional fiber demands increase due to 5G installs  GLW will rerate dramatically.,
"I have exposure to GLW through long-dated short puts ($30 strike price) and long calls ($35 strike price). I believe Corning is a solid company but its stock has suffered for a long time for several reasons: 1) while a technology company, Corning is not nearly as ""sexy"" as other companies covered by technology analysts; 2) its LCD business is brutally competitive and still represents a large percentage of Corning's revenues; and 3) the optical communications business is quite cyclical and memories remain of the early 2000's when Corning almost went bankrupt. As a result, the company has an image of being a stodgy, industrial company that has never been able to fully capitalize on its R&D spending and technology leadership. That said, there is an opportunity for Corning to change that perception by executing its strategy over the next several years. If successful, GLW should be rewarded with a higher relative valuation.",
"I enjoyed the fun little personal anecdote about the $20 bill at the end. I'll share my own $20 bill story:As a kid, I loved looked for change on the ground. Even pennies were a great find.

Not a single penny.On the last day, my mom and sister went shoe shopping at some Disney themed store. I was bored stiff. I started rummaging through some empty boxes looking for bubble wrap to pop. BOOM! $20 bill right in an old Disney shoe box. Couldn't believe it, but now it's in Corning stock.",
"Thanks Confounded.  Two additional points to your well argued post.  First, is that while Corning is not a serial acquirer (which is a bad thing in my book), they do have a track record of savvy acquisitions of which the recent 3M deal is a perfect example.  Second, unlike many suppliers to Apple, Corning is treated as a critical partner not as a 'dumb' supplier to beat up on.  To wit, the $200 m investment by Apple in Corning to ramp up the North Carolina glass plant.  I'm a new shareholder and plan to hold for the long term.",
"Good article, I bought in when the price declined by 10% but then got hit by the general market sell-off. Not mentioned in the article are two factors I especially like. One is the enormous  R&D spend that should keep GLW’s moat wide. The other is the target to make fibre optic cables 50% of total sales in a relatively short time. That is a growth market in the growing “connected world”. I touched on that in my article on MasTec https://seekingalpha.c... and my GLW buy connects me even more into that world.",

Anadarko used to lease our family farm but have figured out they do not know how to develop the minerals in our area.  They sold out and now we are under lease to EOG.  Mayhaps they will know how to get the minerals out of our farm.  But I suspect the price of crude is not sufficient for them to take the risk to drill.  So I figure we will be releasing some time in the future.,
These are great moves that should be mimicked by most of the U.S. O&G industry. Rather than focusing on production increases (that ultimately promote lower prices) a focus on cash flow maximization is sound financial policy.,

It reduces the heparin sulfate in both the CNS and in urine and that is the biomarker for this disease. MRI's show improvements in organ morphology. Disease starts body degradation about age 2 and is currently irreversible. Looking at an older child would not expect much improvement, that is why extension down to 6 months is so critical. We can slow the slope of disease it is shown by hitting it younger. Folks, there is NO cure. There are no palliative measures. The best case now is this treatment which slows the slope of degradation. FDA will walk them through the process. If they get 15 patients in, they probably will be allowed to file this year with a phase 4 prove out afterwards as safety has been proved adequately. I've added this week. JMHO.",

"I thought that the data looked pretty good however I am not surprised that the stock is lower. The problem is that investors wanted a clear answer regarding the efficacy of this drug using a neurocognitive endpoint. Unfortunately the data raised more questions than answers and investors like answers not questions. To provide a definitive answer on the neurocognitive effect of this drug, I think you will need a very large data set and a much longer duration.... perhaps 1-2 years. There is so much noise in a neurocognitive test and these patients all started at different ages with different start8ng parameters. Luckily, I think the FDA will take a more considered approach than Wall Street. They will loook at the data and conclude that this drug is very safe and appears to be providing a benefit to patients. It isn’t clear what the magnitude of this benefit is, or its duration but it might take 3-5 years to answer that question. So they will likely approve the drug in early 2019 and ask the company to conduct a post approval trial to measure the long term benefits of this drug. These patients have nothing other than certain death right now so the FDA will be keen to approve this drug. In the short term, there is not a lot of newsflow for the next 8 weeks which means the stock is dead money. So I guess short term traders will sell it and then rejoin the register once we get nearer the newsflow in late 2Q. When they get breakthrough therapy designation (in May?) and they meet with the FDA and provide investors with a regulatory pathway (in June?) the stock will start to work.",

However, if this business with the bet on the vix had not gone sour for the hedge funds, who are selling their assets to get themselves out of a corner, nflx would have easily hit $350 by now.  Consider that it has kept above $216 since the quarter results was first announced back in January.  The market is a herd and if the herd is bearish then it falls hard and if it is bullish it rises fast.  Now looking at fundamentals:  Everything said is correct, but there is some love out there for NFLX.  It is very good programming.

"There is a probability and then there is a possibility. If your conviction is so strong, you could have also used the same amount that you invested in a single put contract and could have bought 10 vertical put spread contracts with very high probability to be in the money compared to $225 put option and Safer as it breaks even at a much higher stock price. There is a huge resistance @ $230. The vertical spread that I am mentioning here is  21 Jun 2019 250/245. You buy 10 contracts of $250 put and partially offset it by selling $245 put. The put spread is $5 and the cost is $2.28 and your breakeven is @ $247.72. This would provide 120% return in about 16 months if the stock does sink down to the level you are looking at.

Fundamentally everything is a short in this market!,
A family member was tasked with a research project for a hedge fund to explore if NFLX was a good short. I helped and after we were done we concluded they had pricing power and with a few small moves or announcments could rip the faces off any shorts. We concluded it was a better bet as a long position than a short because of pricing power and they could likely raise prices for quite a while. That was when they were around $110 per share.

"The conference call and press release CORT just issued was a jaw dropper full of positive news..   There were four components.   The first was the confirmation of Kormlyn sales--exceptionally strong and due in part to a sales pivot they made three quarters ago to focus on community doctors instead of research centers.   The second was TEVA announcement.   They're more than willing to go to trial and that's minimum 30 months.   The conference call rose serious questions as to whether TEVA legally obtained a pill in order for them to make said application.   The third was the biggest and that is the progress of 134.   Phase II seems to be exceptionally positive.   Remember--if 134 gets approval then the generic threat is moot.   And the fourth was the biggest surprise and that was an advancement of the cancer pipeline.    After a roaring start, CORT pulled back likely because of the Merrill Lynch analyst who has been ""mistaken"" in the past.    We shall see.   In a world of bio skepticism CORT is worthy of belief.",
I look for this company to have its share price back in the $20's in just 2 more quarters.  just when all this nonsense about Teva competition blows over and 134 is starting phase 3 trials.  I have extreme confidence 134 will be approved as this compound is not something entirely new to Cort.  GLTA,
One thing we can agree is that Cort received an unwarranted 40% haircut on something that speculative information and will not even come into play for more than 3 years.  Remember a long time ago Celgene used to be a one trick pony.  This market is just full of unjustified fear now.  The shorts or bears are wrestling for control of this market and are working harder than ever for that control.  Will they succeed? Who knows and who cares.   If you are always investing off of fear in this market you will always be losing money.  Like Buffett find the good companies and stick with them.  Cort is a good company and if they are not bought out they will be around for years to come and be profitable.  Not many companies at their level can say that.  GLTA,
"no comments from management during this time, is it because of quiet period?",
$0.5 for 2021 is a drop from almost $1. I think that’s conservative assuming worst case scenario of 134 not coming to fruition and CORT paying millions in court fees etc. I’m factoring in a gradual loss of market share for Korlym.,

Wouldn’t the 30 month period begin after February of next year/orphan designation expiration? I noticed one analyst lowered FY 2020 EPS a good amount. Prior to the news, they were going to hit $1.50+ for 2020 compared to current consensus of $1 or so. Thanks",
"The downside on CORT is if 134 does not get approved.  On that we agree.   But it would appear that they would know whether the Phase II had failed because they would be going forward with a back up drug.    There is little question that 134 is a superior drug.    Cushings is more prevalent among women than men.   And there isn't a doctor in the world who would prescribe a generic over 134 to a woman of child bearing age.    In the meantime, CORT will have 30 months of sales that should be worth $700MM of sales or more.",
"Though I agree with your conclusion that CORT is a screaming buy much your reasoning is insufficient.   CORT will file a patent infringement case against TEVA that should delay any generic introduction for 30 months.   134 is now in open label which some would argue is indicative that the initial data is positive.   You don't mention Korlym's most significant weakness--that is it causes abortions and many a conservative doctor won't even prescribe it to men.   134 does not have this issue.   As per the pipeline--it shows great promise though I will agree that the valuation is difficult to pinpoint.

"You are missing here something quite significant; the Swedish/Danish/Norwegian Housing Market bubble. Nordea, like many other Swedish Banks, started pushing out largely non-amortizing Floating rate mortgages with (avg!!) tenure over 100 years....which naturally fueled the housing market prices. This is nice from bank perspective, loanbook baloons as well as the default rates (for capital model) are low (how one wouldn´t be able to pay current low interests). The Swedish supervisory has (finally) started tightening controls here...leading to recent housing price decrease in Sweden. When interest pick up, I have some serious doubts how this will play out for Nordea. Nevertheless it is still a good bank, with a nice dividend; I think above is though relevant when considering investment in Nordea.

"Actually with EVO Specifically, it may only be on a few models like you mention currently since it's a new upgrade launch but they had rear seat infotainment sales on lots of vehicle models in the Q IMO. Hopefully EVO, as it replaces some of the older contracts, gains customer traction.Think I saw this list of auto companies from an older PR:""Among the global customers served, include Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Fiat, Ford, GM, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Subaru, Tesla, Volkswagen, and more.""Hopefully it gives a nice bump to automotive YOY going fwd with revs and GMs.Good luck, all in my opinion only.",
"The Expedition and Navigator are only 2 models they shipped in the Q. They have several car models in the midst of contracts beyond those. They probably highlighted the Navigator and Expedition (think the Eco Sport is F too) with Ford since those models received new upgrades I believe in their recent launches and just started but they have a lot more customers than just Ford and just Navigator and Expedition taking product in Q3. Lots more.Anyhow, not a big deal but just wanted to make sure people understand they shipped a lot more EVO than just to F for the Nav and Exp in Q3.It's tough to know on the 25% # since Pat sounded pretty ballparkish about it. Maybe we'll get lucky and it will exceed that.Something to keep in mind, newer  launches tend to carry a bit better margin early in the contracts so hopefully we'll see increasing revs of better margins too. That's what I'm looking for.Company's shares definitely seem cheap but still need to see where automotive goes in the next 12 months.All in my opinion only, good luck.PS- thx for the info on F ramping production on those models. I hadn't seen that yet but bodes well.",
"Perhaps you're right about ~25% since 60% of the EVO launches are replacement business.  My statement regarding the number of models shipping was for the entire quarter.  Only the Expedition and Navigator were shipping for the entire quarter and those are both low production number models.  Chevy Traverse, Equinox, GMC Terrain and the Buick Enclave didn't launch until the middle of the quarter, so we didn't see the full benefit of those yet.  FWIW,  Ford recently announced they are ramping up production of Navigator and Expedition by 25% to meet demand.  The last half of this year should look really solid since most of the EVO platforms will be shipping and the new Klipsch lineup begins shipping in August.  There's some low-hanging fruit in the first half of FY 2019.  The comps aren't too tough, so that might offer a tail wind.",
"CH- On automotive, the 50% comment about EVO as I recall was nailed down by the CC questioner. Something like they currently have roughly 25% of revs from EVO in auto and could look to go to 50% of automotive revs represented (25% upside to revs in automotive segment). That's how I interpreted it and thought it was fairly clear on CC (thx to the questioner).PS- a rather small company nobody is talking about is worth a look (Optex) in my opinion. Defense niche player, biggest US player in periscopes market for combat vehicles and is picking up operating profits with very little CapEx needs. All in my opinion only.",
"Companies like this have no business being public,",
"A few things on this.  I think your revenue projections at Automotive may be too conservative.  You're showing an estimated increase of 15.4% yoy in fiscal year 2019.  On the Q3 conference call CEO Lavelle stated he thought the EVO system would account for as much as 50% of revenues,  You could construe that to mean the run rate for revenues at Automotive could double by the time all platforms are being delivered.  Perhaps he meant that EVO would increase revenues by up-to 50% though.    Only the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition were shipping during the entire quarter in Q3.  Four GM platforms launched in October (only offering one complete month during Q3).  The point being, that I believe your model is probably too conservative at Automotive.There is a problem with your chart on Automotive.  I'm going from memory, but there were quarters this year where the two-year-stack was up ~40%.   Klipsch is rolling out updated versions of their Reference and Reference Premiere speakers this summer.  Their Heritage HP-3 headphones  launched in November were rated the best new headphones of 2017 on CNET and they've hinted they're entering the Automotive space on their Facebook profile. Premium Audio revenues will almost certainly look better than +2% in FY19.Given the weak comps in  Q1 and Q2 at Consumer Accessories I expect that to look better than +2% in FY19.During the Q3 CC Lavelle stated they may begin buying back shares, so I wouldn't jump to conclusions that mgmt doesn't care about shareholder value.  Additionally they've increased book and tangible value and earnings recently.I also don't think concerns about acquisitions should be overblown.  They just booked a huge profit on the sale of Hirschmann, which they just bought a few years ago.  The company has been going for over 50 years, has a book value of $442M, and doesn't sell a single Audiovox branded product.  They must have been able to do something right with acquisitions over the years.  They also stated they may not buy anything and may divest companies.Your points on Eyelock are valid.  John Shalam indicated they'd come to conclusions about that business in 2018 at the shareholders meeting last summer though.This is profitable, but likely to become much more profitable in FY2019 and has an 80% up side to tangible book.  That's not something you see a lot.",

"I think this article fails to appreciate what is a widespread trend throughout the movie theater industry:  the Internet is killing theaters.  The problem is that the Internet has created far too many choices, and as a result, it satisfies almost completely the need for novelty and new experiences that used to be satisfied by cinema.As a result, the growth in theater businesses is going to be anemic for a while, at least until that trend reaches a climax.   You are fighting the wind by investing in this kind of business.   I would question whether a PE of 20+ makes any sense at all.   Shouldn't the PE actually continue to deteriorate to fully absorb what might be a continuing shrinkage of revenue?It is worth pointing out that China is actually one of the most dynamic and large markets for Internet-based video, as evidenced by the huge influence of streaming media players like YY and Momo.   This makes a China-based theater even more at risk.   But, again, this is a worldwide phenomena.   Look at shrinking revenues at AMC theater in the US.  Look at the collapse of Village Roadshow in Australia.   The Internet is eating this business.",

The $1.35 distribution for a stock that yields over 10% is as safe as one can get at these nose bleed levels for dividend yield investors.My thinking is about that whatever shares/units ENB has to issue to cover the distribution is just a cost of capital issue to them. At over 10% ENB's cost of capital for EEP/EEQ equity is too costly. ENB might not fix this issue any time soon.

"Michael, What relationship does ENB have to EEP/EEQ?",
"So being a complete novice on the internal workings of utility regulators, I am asking myself why can't Enbridge go to the Lakehead regulator and say:""Look, we are at 95% capacity and there is tremendous demand for this product.  The companies that use Lakehead and the governments that tax us both benefit if we can find a way to expand the pipeline.   But, we are tapped out financially and we cannot loan more money without hurting our credit rating, which is not in your interest as a regulator either, because you need us to be financially solid.    Let us increase the tariff on Lakehead now, and all the ""excess profits"" from that increase will go into a reserve that is used in four years' time to help finance an expansion of Lakehead on terms that will not take down our credit rating.   As a condition for the tariff increase, we will agree to not spend the reserve for any corporate purpose and it will be held strictly to help finance the future expansion.""Why won't regulators accept these kinds of proposals?    It is incredibly frustrating to read that Enbridge runs an absolutely critical North American pipeline and cannot expand it because they cannot finance it.   Then we as investors have to watch it circle down the drain and slowly lose value because everyone who is looking for EBITDA growth refuses to touch a company that cannot expand its revenues because it cannot finance capex cost-effectively.  This should be the regulator's problem as much as it is Enbridge's problem.  It seems to me like the utility and the regulator should be able to work proactively together to do something for the stakeholders.",

"Yes, as ENB says in it's investor presentation. ""The company has targeted non-core asset sales of C$10B with at least C$3B expected to occur in 2018. "" (wells fargo)And of course issue ENB equity to acquire EEP/EEQ equity. This will reduce the cash flow to EEP equity holders since ENB's dividend rate is less then EEP distribution rate.The rating agencies will be pleased if ENB cleans up it's messy balance sheet, of which the complex corporate structure is part of.Also the whole reason for having EEP equity to issue is to help ENB raise money to build out pipelines, was when EEP equity was twice it's current price.  That is no longer the case, no reason to continue having EEP/EEQ exist to issue equity at these low levels. ENB is EEP largest equity holder. I think that more likely then not to buy out EEP/EEQ at $15-$17 is better then issueing EEP equity at $13-$14 in the future if money to build out pipelines is needed. Issue ENB at it's current price is better then issueing EEP equity at it's current price.ENB is not  bailing out EEP investor's , ENB is taking EEP investor's to the cleaners, if it buys back EEP for less then $17.",
"http://bit.ly/2zxii2AAccording to this site.

Sell High, Buy Low....That is what Enbridge did with MEP.  Despite acting like they have no interest, ENB is definitely doing the math. Like the cost to finance pipeline construction with the current corporate step up. Or do a roll  up like KMI did and lower their interest cost to finance the debt. The rating agency would likely upgrade ENB credit rating.While I sit tiight, I get paid over 10% a year to wait.",
Enbridge claims about a 3% increase in distribution per year over the next few years.  This does not seem at all unreasonable.  EEQ currently yields 11%.  I find a 14% expected return over time on an investment grade name with strong sponsor support quite acceptable.,
"MBThank you for the work you share with us. For me, having a part of my portfolio in utility like income producing assets that are best of breed and provide 10%+ distribution, is a very good thing.

"I have ENB in my portfolio but in regard to MLPs I have gone a different route.  I sold off my SEP and bought a position in AMLP ETF.   This immediately spreads my risk and opens me up ownership in many MLPs.  The rate of return is not as high as an individual issue the risk is reduced in an otherwise high risk group.  MLPs are lagging investments in the oil patch.  They are late to be able to change or upgrade is contracts.  Now that crude prices have risen, new contracts will generate higher rates of return, but the old contracts have to expire and be re-negotiated.",

Dumped EEP last year and replaced it with SEP and MIC. We'll see ... .Retired income/dividend-growth investor,
This is indeed a great analysis.  Thank you.,
"You do terrific articles and I enjoyed this one.  Your phrase ""more better names trade higher"" gave me a laugh.  Thanks.",
"Thank you for your well-informed assessment and your cautious outlook.  After many years' lapse, I recently re-purchased EEQ in a taxable account as a ""bond-substitute with benefits.""  The PIK feature allows me to defer taxes on the current income until I sell shares, if I sell the shares, and then to pay only capital gains taxes.  OTW, they end up in my estate and pass to my heirs un-taxed, including any appreciation.  The current dividend rate is more than enough to compensate for any liquidation risk, IMO.  If KMI is a guide, that risk is minimal, as KMI was in far worse shape than ENB.  And EEQ's downside risk is probably no greater than bonds with much lower yields, especially in today's market.Reversion to the mean says ENB may be at the bottom of the cycle.  I suppose ENB may also tire of its complicated structure and buy out EEQ, but until that happens I'll just collect those PIKs.  EEQ is not for everyone.  It is tiny, has no peers now, none of the financial services, SA included, show it paying any dividend at all and it doesn't even get mentioned by ENB in all its public announcements.  Without any PR from ENB, there is not much appreciation potential--but that's also true of bonds these days.",
"Just to be clear, EEQ causes dilution, but not to just itself.  It dilutes EEP and EEQ at the same time.  Just as all DRIP shares do to all stocks.  I believe EEQ is about 18% of EEP (18% of the EEP shares are DRIPing - effectively).  The change of management/pay taxes thing is a total red herring.   If  EEQ is not equal to  EEP in all future anything - there will be huge lawsuits. 97% of EEQ is held by institutions...I believe the price of EEQ is about 6% lower than EEP because of the 10 day rule.With EEQ get your dividend (shares) at the higher price (just before ex dividend).In theory, if EEP is paying 10% per year and 2.5% per quarter.  All else remaining constant, the price will be 2.5% higher just before ex-dividend (when you get your shares) than just after ex-dividend.  In theory, you could own EEP and pick up the shares 2.5% cheaper than the EEQ recipients get them - by waiting a day to buy them yourself with your dividend money.To compensate for that effect, the EEQ holder gets 6% more shares to begin with.Some hard numbers:  With today's numbers. $10000 EEP pays $261 per quarter now $10000 EEQ pays $280 per quarter (in shares) now.But the EEQ shares are about 2.5% ""overpriced"", so worth 0.974% of that the day after you get them - or $273 the day after ex-dividend (when in theory the price drops by 2.61% = EEP dividend).   So with the 10 day formula - you really got $273 per quarter (in shares).But the EEP guy only can spend $261 that next day (to buy shares).  And he gets to pay an accountant to deal with the K1s.  And he can not time his tax events (what I care most about). All to save him worrying about a non-event (which prior history with KMR shows is not an issue).   The EEP guy is paying a 0.48% ""service fee"" per year. For less options/control.The EEQ-EEP spread has been lower in the recent past ($0.50 vs $0.89).  My math says it is valid at levels close to $0.34.   I have never seen anybody explain it properly. So my guess is that it is not properly valued.  Just accepted as historic fact and so has been left to drift out of whack.  (Note at a price of $20, such as last year, a spread of $0.50 is probably correct).",
Bought EEP years ago when it was in the $40's so guess I am in until the end....,
Could you explain the term :  sell side analyst Great article.C.O.,
"Hi Michael,Thanks for the analysis on this. I see fair value much higher though as price anchoring is permeating the analyst minds in my opinion.Did IR confirm the junior status to you?I read this portion,""""In the event of a liquidation of the Partnership not resulting from any action taken by the Partnership or otherwise approved by us at the direction of our shareholders, the value of our shares would likely decline.The Partnership may not take any action to cause a liquidation of the Partnership unless, prior to such liquidation, Enbridge has agreed to purchase all of our shares or we have voted to approve such liquidation at the direction of our shareholders. In the event of a liquidation of the Partnership not resultingfrom any action taken by the Partnership or otherwise approved by us at the direction of our shareholders, the value of our shares will depend on the after-tax amount of the liquidating distribution received by us as the owner of i-units. The terms of the i-units provide that no allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction will be made in respect of the i-units until such time as there is a liquidation of the Partnership. If there is a liquidation of the Partnership, it is intended that we will be allocated income and gain in an amount necessary for the capital account attributable to each i-unit to be equal to that of a commonunit.""'That last line is pretty clear pari passu line to me.But that said, they might be worth less due to do the tax structure and as you have highlighted. So in theory, if there is $20 left for each and the basis of EEQ is down to $10 (random number), EEQ would have to pay $2.5 in taxes so owner would get $17.50 vs $20 EEP.I am not sure EEP would be exempt from these taxes either. I think it is highlighting that the basis will be different. Do you see it differently?",
"Michael:Thanks for article.Although the future is unknown, when KMI rolled up KMR (same structure as EEQ), I received more shares in KMI at a significant unit cost reduction to under $10/share in KMI.I bought EEQ in 2015, at much higher prices, to replace KMR.  The additional shares every quarter gradually reduce my unit cost. Yesterday, I added 23% more shares of EEQ at $12.Eventually, I might sell the most costly first buys. But right now holding them just accumulates more shares every quarter, as the share distribution is cumulative on the shares you own.Rather than using Enbridge's dividend yield, I track the value of the shares I receive each quarter to measure my return.","Enbridge Energy Partners: Income Investor Delight, With Caveats"

"I think there is some miscommunication on used cars. There has been a surge of vehicles coming off-lease and going into the used car market. That has been depressing the price of used cars. This is good news for most people. Many people have hung onto their existing cars for reasons mentioned in the article (high prices on new ones, scarcity of credit for people who lost badly in the housing crisis). The increasing average age of cars in the fleet is good for ORLY. The older the car, the more you're likely to spend, in any given year, to keep it running. But this surge in newer, well-maintained vehicles coming off-lease means that people will be able to buy a newer car, needing less maintenance, and scrap the old one once and for all. If I'm right, we may see a reduction in the average age of vehicles on the road. If that happens ... pain for those who sell replacement parts. I'd suggest keeping an eye on that metric.

"I'm long AGN but the analysis by Michael Waterhouse (Morningstar, 1/12/18) is worth a read on the quality of phase 3 data/candidates to date.  There is data that doesnt sound so promising for  some of these 5 star drugs.  Either they are ""me too"" with no real therapeutic advantage or in some cases obstacles to overcome to get them to the FDA.  As far as I know, a new drug has to show better efficacy than the standard in order for approval.  There may be phase 3's that dont make it. I think the street sees this too and thats why there is this stagnation around the $170-180 price.  AGN has had positive earnings now the last 5 reporting periods so the needle doesnt  seem to move due to earnings.  Neither does it move to share buybacks, CEO confidence purchases of additional shares.  AGN stock hinges on all the M&A pipeline drugs Saunders has bought and touted as stellar.  The other issue with drugs that look good are the estimates of market value and what they anticipate making on the drugs per year.  It's a good read and worth looking at before plunging into more positions in AGN for the long term.  I tend to think there will be more pain down the road unless these phase 3's turn out stellar.",

Unfortunately, none of these efforts has triggered additional milestone payments or sales from its Biogen deal.

After two years, investors have clearly tired of the story.Slow Developing Pipeline. The company has been advancing its key candidates. XLRS has enrolled 12 patients in its phase 1/2 dosage trials, with early results being safe and well tolerated. This treatment was originally designated as an orphan drug on May 21, 2007, per the FDA’s orphan drug database. It is now over 10 years that XLRS has been in development, though AGTC has been making some strides.The XLRP candidate was only designated an orphan drug in July of 2017, but this occurred over two years after the Biogen deal. The phase 1/2 trial has not yet started but is scheduled to in 2018. The lead ACHM CNGB3 Phase 1/2 trial has enrolled 4 patients. AGTC recently made the decision to reduce its dosing level as it has been achieving decent activity with reduced dosing.There has been some progress in all their candidates but at this stage it is quite early to determine efficacy.",

"Im hearing from people that work at SHW that the valspar acquisition is going well and exciting people because it brings new capabilities and will make it much stronger to compete with PPG in the automotive space, pro and DIY markets.  They can take the private label auto and brand and t SHW which probably increases the margin by 30% per unit.  It may not last ok cheap but i think it is strong now and has significant strength to take share from PPG.  Stock goes higher and wish Berkshire would buy it.",
Nice overview of the current situation. I've been looking for an opportunity to buy this stock for years but couldn't hold my nose and do it with some of the valuations post recession. I'm glad you were bold enough to name a target price range - most don't have the nuts to lay down a number. Good work here.,

Macau looks like they will be ok in not caring too much. Again, I think you'll see a settlement soon with Macau, and Nevada will now take longer because WSJ reporting that they are getting police involved in evaluating complaints.  Wow...if true that's a major shift by Nevada regulators in responding to this.  If they and WSJ opened this up, they have to clean the entire Vegas situation up.  Wow.",

"They need to get to a settlement ASAP with all the regulators.  I assume it will be a requirement to add new independent board directors.

That's a huge unknown liability even though I think Okada has no case.",

It is unlikely PE will buy the company since they would have to pass all the regulatory reviews, however they could buy Elaine's shares as a passive investment.

Those two have worked together for more than a dozen years.  I have faith that Matt has obtained his position due to talent and drive.A less likely possibility is breaking the company completely in two.  They already have the Macau listing separately, but I don't see anything to gain by doing this.",
"Howard, I have followed you from the lows when Steve Wynn was accumulating shares to your long price of $200 many months ago.  You have significant insight into the business and your experience serves those who listen.  I have followed this company and its predecessor, Mirage Resorts, for over 20 years.While I am personally disappointed in the alleged behavior and that the man is no longer at the helm, this company is not Steve alone anymore.  While he might make the final call on certain things, a company of this size and this maturity has a team.  Steve talks about the team and the cumulative design experience.  The depth of talent is great, albeit muted on quarterly conference calls.  Steve's knowledge of the business, and his personal risk of making bold bets like Mirage at the time, and Wynn Palace have reshaped the landscape for those in gaming.  Without a visionary like Steve making bold bets the company might suffer 5+ years from now but let's think back a bit.  Howard said something when the first WSJ article came out that stuck with me.  He said that Steve's imprint on the business is in place for 90% of the company. What might be missing is his design element on the new property in Vegas (New Frontier), and possibly the Macau expansion.  What people need to remember is the purchase of the New Frontier and the Macau expansion hasn't just popped up.  Wynn has been planning both for a long time.  My guess is that ink has already dried on ideas that will continue to have his vision as part of any future development.The risk I see is that the state of Massachusetts will levy a hefty fine to the company but revoking the license means the loss of jobs and revenue to the state at a time when Wynn Boston Harbor is set to deliver both at a level never seen by the state in its history.  Even a $10M fine can be absorbed in a week's worth of revenue in Macau.  Remember the last conference call?  Steve talked about $3-4M per day mid week.One last thing that everyone should remember.  While Steve isn't the CEO or the Chairman anymore, he still owns almost 12% of the company and ""his"" team is in place and has been for quite some time to carry on the vision he created.  While I don't condone any of the alleged allegations, Steve has made the best decision for the company.  He has freed Elaine's shares and soon the dust will settle, just as Howard indicates.When Steve Jobs passed away, no one thought Tim Cook would have a chance.  Tim has done an incredible job with the company and created shareholder value.  Matt will do the same for Wynn Resorts.  At 42 and with 16 years at the company, he has learned what it means to deliver the Wynn experience and reap the profits from that premium.  The difference now is that Matt can still pick up the phone and get advice from the man who created the company and ensure the Wynn premium continues well into the future.I am long WYNN and remain confident in its long term positioning.",
The only one question to author. With current price 163 projected target range 180-200 represents 12-25% upside. That’s a very good trade or investment. So why author is not planning to initiate position?,

I can’t see this company staying intact given the two large blocks of stock floating around, the growth/development pipeline and the cash flow existing properties throw off.  Either in whole or in parts, either driven by the Wynns or despite the Wynns, this company doesn’t exist as it currently stands in a year. Could private equity buy them? Could LVS buy them? Genting?

It’s been reported that cancellations are coming for the Las Vegas property may have an affect on earnings. Also, do you think that it needs to be rebranded?

Steve Wynn Surrenders Control Over Ex-Wife Elaine's Shareshttps://yhoo.it/2BPmO0F,
Wynn is already 76 years old. Who cares if he had to leave 3-5 years early ? As an investor you knew he was going to retire in a few years anyways. The opportunity and future of Macau is what matters. Short term traders can go in and out of this stock if they want but whoever playing the long game should hold this stock for years. Nothing has really changed. Thanks for the article Howard.,
"You are all wrong and Howard is correct. Wynn doesn’t Deal cards, serve drinks or handle the accounting. The businesses are up and running. Wynn, while talented, is 76 and blind. He built a great company. Remember, he built Mirage, Bellagio and the Golden Nugget. Mirage and Bellagio got acquired and didn’t miss a step. Tilman Fertitta has transformed the Golden Nugget and made it better. Wynn will either return to $200 or will be acquired without Steve Wynn being able to block a transaction. That is just life and the assets are too great. At this level buy all you can. Stock sells for $200 plus a share. This will happen.  I am all in. Listen to Howard.",
A charismatic leader typically sets the tone.   Worth more than a passing concern that Wynn the company has more trouble to uncover.,
Love Wynn but losing steve and all the Bs that will follow I don’t see this as a co I will hold moving forward. Disclosure I did sell around $180 after the NYT piece came out.,
"This is one of the few times I am going to disagree with Howard.  I see $180 as a top for the year for the following reasons:1.  Shareholder lawsuits will persist, and cause the price to fluctuate more towards the negative side.2.  Steve Wynn is not unlike how investors view Elon Musk or Steve Jobs.  Fundamentally the company is sound, but I think Wynn's premium on the stock is closer to 25-30% .3.  We are currently in a correction - I believe this impacts Wynn to the downside in the near term.4.  Further downgrades to Neutral is most likely coming.5.  We need at least a quarter of solid performance from the new CEO to stabilize investor confidence.6.  Given how Wynn has risen so much over the past year and half, most investors will take some profit.Wynn can definitely defy all odds and go back to $200, however this isn't a risk scenario I feel matches the potential rewards I could reap from.",

"Good write up Jared, I've been following this stock for a year now, still struggling to understand the market's indifference to it.  I know the stock has run from $25, but at that price it was an absolute steal and the growth rate and margin outlook has improved since then as you say here.SKX has the best exposure to what is right now the fastest growing segment, women's athleisure shoes.  They also have the best exposure to higher growth overseas markets after several years of major investment.  I agree that this should drive growth and margins over the next year or two now, as much of the groundwork investment has been done.    With similar margins across this sector, SKX is now generating top line growth of at least double the average.  Sales growth for SKX will be 12-15% this year and next.   WWW is generating negative growth, Columbia 5%, Crocs negative, Deckers 3%, Nike 7%, on consensus estimates.  Yet SKX is on the lowest P/E of all of them for 2019.  The stock hasn't even managed to gain since it reported those results which led to 5-7% EPS upgrades.",
Totally agree- and I am not being a jerk about this. The story has been very clear to those who dig really deep. 2018 will be the turning point. The company has spent a fortune opening up stores and building out infrastructure in every corner of the globe- that is why the stock has gotten consistently hammered the last 2 years when operating expenses always were way larger than anyone ever modeled. But they weren't spending for nothing- selling 20 million pairs in China is not easy and you need to spend a ton of money to build that business to a billion and beyond as well as India and all of Southeast Asia. Read the conference calls- Weinberg told you everything you needed to know including when and why 2018 would be the year everything finally leveraged. Several huge things changed in the last 4 months- the dollar is down 10%- for a company that does 52-55% of their business overseas that is a massive tailwind- for what used to be a huge headwind- that is a pure profit turnaround. what also changed is xmas was excellent and every country is growing nicely- so macro trends have all been going great for Skechers right as their entire worldwide global infrastructure build out is pretty much done and paid for.Last year Adidas was the Wall Street darling- this year it will be Skechers. Most investors know this and are positioned accordingly- except for the owner of the near 1 million shares dumped today before 11 am- the stock still will confuse many- buy and hold for bigger gains.See I agree with you after all that there is more to go- but I am saying that the stock at 23 was an absolute screaming steal and I have the comments to back that up- and the prior articles to articulate the entire story.,
Skechers free cash flow visibility was well visible to us at 23.  It's not a better bargain at an 80% higher price. Rethink your last statement Jared- the only thing that happened is that it became more clear to some people who actually bought the stock up to higher levels. The key is to find the real hidden financial story before it happens and get long before the story plays out.,
"Thank you for the article. I've been long on this stock since the early $20s and bought in during the brief upper teens dip.  They are absolutely crushing it.  Management has done a great job of setting expectations for 2016 and 2017.  The margin expansion was always slated to hit in Q1 2018 and it seems they were a little early.  I'm expecting a great 2018 for Skechers.  Great to hear them talk about expectations through 2020.  At this price it's certainly not the bargain it was at ~$23, but it will still yield a solid return over the next 3 years",
We have made a fortune owning and trading Skechers. Go back and read our articles- a how to guide to finding great value and being patient. 2018 will be the year it all comes together for Skechers.

"Actually, the time to get in this stock was in the 20s, when the shorts were hammering it.",
All I can tell you is that my wife absolutely loves her Skechers for casual wear. The most comfortable ever. She just bought a 2nd pair a year after the first - and the first are still going strong. I will look at the men's when I need a new casual sneaker.,
Seriously can't believe this stock isn't over 50 on this quarterly report. In a very expensive market there are very few values and SKX seems one to me.,
SKX was in top ten of sales for Alibaba on singles day. I see big growth in Asian market as SKX is a style statement which really plays into that market. Style is also a big deal for the selfie generation.,
"Skechers make very comfortable casual shoes, in the same way that Meindl produce comfortable walking boots, and Clark’s half brogues are great for the office. The common thread is that all of these brands cater for wider feet and are available in half sizes. There is a problem with Skechers UK stores - they do not sell a full range in half sizes and need to carry more stock.Comparing Skechers with Meindl, Skechers are more comfortable on paved roads or sidewalks, Meindl are better on grass and mud. Skechers slip ons are a must for the airport, whether you have to take your shoes off or not, as there is no metal strengthening in mine to set off the machines !As I like the product, definitely a buyer on weakness.

"Thanks @Dan Stringer . Nice article. What are your thoughts on NDRA today?This week's equity raise at the low price of $2.10/sh was a bit surprising considering a) the average price over the preceding 30 days was $2.93/sh (~30% discount), and b) as it turned out they were just days away from receiving approval from Health Canada for an ITA. I understand biotech has been selling off recently, but it still raises questions. I suppose best case scenario -- if we can call it that -- was a strategic investor and/or insiders loading up at a better price. What do you think?More troubling is that they only raised net proceeds of about $2.7M. Not much of a runway there. At this point the monthly burn rate may be up to $750k-$1M. On 6/30/18, they had $2.2M in cash. Conservatively assuming they burned through just about all of that this quarter, this recent raise buys them roughly one more quarter. Would you agree?In your article you rightly suggested they would need to raise capital in late 2018. You felt a raise of $8M-$10M would have been appropriate - I tend to agree. So why such a small raise, especially considering the prospectus they recently filed was for $10M? Pessimistic rationale is that their backs were against the wall in a weak biotech market and that was all they could muster. Optimistic rationale is that, now that they have the ITA, they will commence human studies soon and [hopefully] have good data out by year-end. One would think such news would be a boon to the SP, and that subsequently they could do an even larger raise on much more attractive terms. What do you think?Finally, do you have any opinion on the likelihood of good data coming out of the human studies?Thanks again.",

If somebody pulls out a tablet, it is more likely than not to be an iPad.Women, particularly young ones, seem to favor the plus iPhone models.  In Hong Kong, female use of iPhones is the rule rather than exception.  Nearly 80% of female passengers in the subways and buses have their noses buried in an iPhone.  A common refrain is that iPhones are too expensive for China and particularly India.  But, in countries where an iPhone might cost a month’s salary or more, people really appreciate value.  They know that iPhones and iPads last longer.  An iPhone not only retains its value better but may be used for 4 years and then sold for a third of the price.  So,  people save up to buy iPhones.  In Hong Kong, many Filipino maids have iPhones on the streets of Hong Kong.  An iPhone is a month’s salary but they clearly find it worthwhile to pay US$600 for an iPhone that can used for 4 years and sold for $200.  That is $100/year.  In India, probably the first expensive item that a family would buy is a refrigerator for $400, then a flat screen television for $600, and then a cell phone for $800.  They want the best and most reliable, because they can’t afford to buy another one.Finally, Southeast Asia alone has 650 million people, more than twice the population of the U.S.  South Asia, including India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, has 1.75 billion, more than all non-Asian populations combined.  So, if Apple sold iPhones to even 1% of the Asian population of 4.5 billion, that is 45 million iPhones.",

"Have owned EGD off and on for 10 years and have spoken to Fred Davidson on many occasions. He is honest and transparent and competent. He just got caught in two simultaneous cyclical downdrafts (oil and metals) right after expanding heavily. Mineral drillers and oil drillers are very cyclical businesses. Davidson bought Bertram when oil prices were high and heading upwards, particularly in the Canadian oil sands. Bertram had highly specialized large diameter coring drills that were only of use in oil sands. Bertram also had a lot of drills used for seismic testing in oil fields. WTI oil dumped from $120 a barrel to $27 and oil sands coring and seismic drilling promptly went almost to zero. The active drill rig count across the whole oil industry dropped like a stone and many drillers had financial difficulties. My guess is Davidson thought Bertram would diversify EGD away from total dependence on the highly cyclical precious metal (PM) and base metal prices. The idea is when metals dumped, oil would offset it, and vice versa. Unfortunately, both oil and metals cycled together and put EGD in a difficult financial bind. When the financing bill came due, EGD had to take the best financing that was on offer. Given that both oil and metals were at the bottom of their cycles, the financing came at a steep price. That is just how these situations work. It is also why the stock price is so low and why it has the potential to be a big winner if oil and metal prices cycle back up.Hindsight is always 20/20. It was unfortunate EGD bought Bertram when it did, but at the time it seemed like a good diversifying move. Nobody anticipated oil would drop from $120 to $27.The good news is both PM and base metal prices are materially higher and appear to be on a solid upward trend. Base metals in particular are seeing strong price improvements. At the same time oil is recovering. Oil has been gyrating between $58 and $67 for awhile now. That is high enough to trigger drilling activity in the Canadian oil sands, which is driving up EGD's oil drilling revenues.We are also seeing material growth in mineral drilling with Geodrill and Major Drilling and other drillers. More meters drilled and higher capacity utilization have been reported over the last 2 quarters. Hopefully we will start to see improvements in price per meter. Global GDP growth is solid and accelerating.As was seen in the press release noted in RbarPNW's comment, we are starting to see stronger drilling demand and better financial results for EGD in mineral and oil sands drilling. This is already driving the stock price up.Personally I would like to see EGD sell Bertram when that business improves. With the rapid adoption of autonomous electric cars , oil seems to me to be a poor long term bet. I would like to see EGD expand their hydrovac and utility drilling by a large margin. That is a profitable business and would offset the cyclicality of mineral drilling.With the solid and accelerating global GDP growth and the extreme downturn in exploration drilling over the last several years, I think we are going to see a significant increase in mineral drilling demand. With the higher oil prices, we are going to see an increase in oil sands drilling. So we should see accelerating revenue and profit gains for EGD going forward. At the current stock price, EGD is a good, albeit highly risky, bet.Having said all of the above, everything depends on oil and metal prices. If we get another big dump in those, EGD will be in serious trouble. So watch those carefully and be prepared to bail out if the trend reverses to the downside.It should also be noted that there are less risky mineral drillers like Major Drilling and Geodrill. One could also consider Foraco, which is a higher risk/higher reward play similar to EGD.",

"Energold trades at a discount because it loses money; there is a negative return on capital here from operations in a highly cyclic business.  And management did not treat shareholders as partners in last June's refinancing of 5 year debt.   ""The Convertible Loan is convertible into common shares of the Company, in whole or in part, at the sole discretion of the lenders, at a conversion price of $0.85 per share + 4 million shares at $1.50 warrants.  Management's self-dealing participation in this dilutive financing is a warning flag that cannot be ignored. This report ignores that a common high risk in Canadian small caps has already been realized in Energold.  The low tide has revealed the true nature of Energold's management.  Since the author of this article already owns the stock, it is good to see that he has an exit plan.Energold's price responded well to their January press release on an uptick in business:http://bit.ly/2BQ7KjC",
"Robert - I've been following (and owned) this company for years. Your perspective on the fundamentals is reasonable. The problem with Energold is the financing deal they did in February 2017. It was very attractive for those who participated in the deal (through Extract Capital). For normal shareholders, it was relatively expensive money and it represents a great deal of dilution at 0.85 and 1.50. I'm not certain whether Energold had much of a choice, they needed money. Unfortunately, if things come together for them (i.e. you win as a shareholder), you're going to be stuck at 1.00 due to the dilution.  Additionally, be careful of the value trap of the liquidation value of their drilling assets. The value of those assets when actually sold can be much lower than you might expect. This company could go to zero.I like Fred. He has a folksy charm. He received criticism for the bought deal in 2012 @ $5.20. It effectively saved the company though. So... he's pretty cagey or lucky. I'll take either :)Take care",

It may even be worth more as the PRB and Utica are two basins currently in the exploration stage.  Their values may increase significantly once we understand better of their potentials.  PRB’s value has increased from about 1k per acre two years ago to about 4K per acre and it may increase more in future years.,
"I did a very rough estimate of CHK’s worth: Macellus ($5-7bn), Utica ($2bn), Eagle Ford ($5bn), mid-conn ($2bn), Haynesville ($3bn), PRB($1bn), shares in midstream($0.5bn).  Total is about 18-20bn.  It’s total liability is about $13bn ($10bn debt +$1.7bn pref shares + 1.2bn NWC).  So the net worth of the company is about $5-7bn, 2-3 times of its current market value.

From the latest 8K, it seems they have about 7.7 million acres under lease.  If we assume the same value for this acreage as the 250k acres sold at 0.5 billion, we would get to $15.4 billion.  That would get the share price to about $6 after paying of $10 billion debt.  They have assets like 20 million shares in FTSI.  They would bump up the per share value over $6.

"I think people are bagging on this stock pretty hard:1. Oil production is up over 100,000 barrels, and that's what was planned.2. They sold assets for 500 million and even with the sale show overall production up y-o-y. Yes, they plan on seeing a dip at the beginning of 2018, but plan on it reaching back to its current levels and staying flat for the rest of the year.3. They sold part of their equity in FTSI for 78 million and still have around 500 million in value (at the current stock price) that they can still sell. If you take all that and the recent sale, you have a good chunk of the debt through 2020 eliminated.4. All the people mad about 2017's capex need to realize that oil field service costs were not as high as they are now, with oil at 60+. I think lawler made a smart move by planning 2017 as the year to push oil production higher. He did so at a lower cost than he would have this year.5. I personally think the earnings call is going to indicate a much lower capex planned for 2018. Now, this is where the sink or swim balancing act begins. If they can't maintain production with a reduced capex, then they are in for some trouble. And all the hatred pointed at this company will be justified. However, I think the 8k recently released was a little taste of something much sweeter to come.Just food for thought; I don't know why anyone would short this stock.

"Earlier I made a humorous comment about falling knives, but something interesting happened with this particular fallen knife; it stopped falling while others continued to fall during the final throws of this recent 10% “correction”.  CHK stopped falling at $2.8, and bounced up, and continued to bounce up and down between $2.8 and $2.85, while others continued to drop, and while the Dow continued its second half of another drop of $1,000+ (4.15%), and the S&P dropped another 3.75%, in one day.  This bounce at $2.8, while others continued to drop, was interesting to me.As a long investor, there was a time, up until very recently, where I would have said that I could watch this thing (CHK) run all the way up to $7 and not regret ever investing a dollar, unless I saw something more tangible from Lawler and his crew.  But, in light of the recent pre-earnings release, and some macro information, this thing is looking very intriguing.Here are the macros I have been focusing on:*JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs recently up’d their price/bbl to $70-80+, stating that it could happen within the next three to six months.  They announced these targets for 2018 just days before the 10% market correction began last Friday. *JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have been working with Saudi Aramco, with JPM already on board, and GS in the running.  *Saudi Arabia is banking its future on the Aramco IPO as the hinge pin for their Vision 2030 plan.  *The term “rebalancing”, used by the Big international players (OPEC and non-OPEC), is not just referring to the balance of supply and demand, but to the balance of power/control/market-s...  *Rebalancing is very nearly achieved. *Venezuela still needs to be capped; almost there; about to collapse; possible US sanctions. *Canada’s oil reserves are 3rd largest in the world, with Saudi Arabia and Venezuela being 1st and 2nd respectively (Venezuela now nearly capped).  But two Canadian pipelines have been shot down, with only one straw left in the suck, and that’s the Keystone XL, which runs from Alberta Canada, through the US, to the Gulf of Mexico, where Saudi Aramco is now 100% owner of the largest refinery in the US, Port Arthur; perfectly suited to refine Alberta’s heavy bitumen. And if you have been watching Cenovus Energy (CVE), one of the largest producers (integrated) in Canada, guess who is now their new CEO; Alex Pourbaix, who had been championing Keystone XL when he worked for TransCanada, and who also knows how to play ball with the US.  So Canada’s supply is now under control too.*The US production has now surpassed Saudi Arabia, and has begun the process of becoming net exporters (oil/natgas).  The US/North America is now the new swing producer (I had said this months ago in another post, calling the US and Canada the new W-OPEC “western opec”, but heads would spin back then when I would start with that crazy talk).*Regarding the supply/demand meaning in the term “rebalancing”:  Supply is now back within the 5 year average, and the market is now in backwardation, where the spot price is greater than the future/hedged price, which results in the price being chased up over time (up to $80+ per bbl this year). *Regarding potential oil inventory bottleneck which could skew prices downward:  this refinery maintenance season’s outages are estimated to be 35% less than last year for Jan and Feb, and 55% less for March. Read here: https://bloom.bg/2BO0moN*The recent 10% market correction results in many market shoppers, some of which are contrarian, bottom-of-the-barrel, blood-in-the-streets shoppers.  CHK is certainly that. *Here’s a good read for an explanation as to what really caused this recent correction, and to add credence to $80 oil this year, and soon:http://bit.ly/2BiQvX0*With oil between $70-80, CHK will be profitable, cash flow positive, can manage debt, and can sell assets for a premium to take a bigger bite out of debt.  The stage is set.  In addition:  CHK currently trades below some investment houses marginable threshold of $3.  One could imagine a run up scenario where, as oil starts its run to $80, many long investors may buy on margin, pushing margin forward, accelerating the run in tandem with the short’s short coverings.  Yeah, I know, don’t try to catch a falling knife, and don’t chase it up like that.  But with all of the above in play, it’s going to happen.  And the risk takers will be rewarded.

"Anyone else concerned with the $4.1million instrument backlog at the end of 2017 (from annual statement)?  This is the lowest backlog in 5 years.  It suggests they only booked 11 orders in Q4.  I understand the BGI order is considered Q1 2018 and the other Chinese order hasn't officially been placed.  A $4.1 million instrument revenue would place Q1 revs under $20M, especially given they guided to lower consumable sales.  I can see now why they raised money at $2.40.  Another lower guidance for 2018 in the Q1 earnings?",
Breakeven will be at 200M with a 60% margin.  Realistically we're looking at break even in 2020 (assuming ~30% growth in 2019 and 2020).  Cashflow will be -50M in 2018 and -30M in 2019.  My guess is they need to raise another 60M to get them to profitability.  The 30M raised will last them until Q4 when they reach a balance of ~50M.  Q4 2018 starting cash balance (90M-14M-14M-14M) = 48M My guess is they will raise another 30M in Q4 when they announce the new 8M ZMW chip that should boost the stock to more favorable levels.  The only wild card is if this new clinical deal will include a cash influx similar to the Roche deal.  The clinical deal should also be done around Q3-Q4.  If it provides a 30-40M influx similar to the roche deal then that would push out the need to raise additional funds until early 2019.  A clinical deal + a new chip will also drive the stock price to much more favorable levels where a dilution would only be 3-5% to raise another 30M.  I feel there will be a lot of upside in this stock in Q4 similar to what we saw in 2015.  Time will tell.,

"I've owned CME since it went public 15 or so years ago.  Never sold a share through lots of ups and downs and never lost faith in the company and the role it plays in world finance.  It is now my largest holding with near 30% annual dividend yield on my initial investment.  I also do not understand why this stock has not shown greater growth in share price given the stability of the business model.  Yes, it is very complex and not very sexy but I will likely stay long many years to come.",
Long CME with covered calls (currently June 175s). The calls combined with the dividends get me 10%+ a year. Love this stock.,
"CME is a cash cow. It's not a sexy stock, the public seems to not understand what they do, or how higher interest rates and volatile markets add to CME's bottom line. Plus, the excellent divided, which the quarterly was raised 6% a few days ago ($.70), and the special dividend, which was $3.25 a share on top of the quarterly, and you get a very nice return on top of cap appreciation.

The Procter & Gamble Company has been trying to streamline itself. I can't help but to think an acquisition right now would possibly suggest management is rudderless. What kind of acquisition do you envision them making?I'm not sure I'd rely upon making a comparison to Unilever N.V. Especially over the last 12 months. The move 3G made towards them appears to have helped management focus and be spurred on to demonstrate why the owners of Unilever N.V. are better off keeping Unilever N.V. independent. If they fail to do so owner unhappiness towards management of Unilever N.V. would be justified.,
I'm guessing with such an outstanding history of dividend increases we will be hearing news of such an increase very shortly.  Along with the GE comparison I certainly hope they don't token raise it and then have to slash it later on.

"AMD shoot up with when they released their AMD Opteron™ X-Series server processors in the mid-2000's, then Intel began to pay AMD customers to not buy AMD products. It paid billions to Dell and other companies and was very successful for a couple of years until AMD took them to court.. AMD was winning and before the court sentenced Intel for unethical competitive practices, it settled and payed a couple billion of dollars to AMD..AMD bought ATI.. Their goal was to create a hybrid CPU/GPU processor, and anybody who understands technology thought they were crazy to try to develop a hybrid processor. The reason being that it is not only a very complex problem but technology advances every year and makes it impossible to be upgrading the processor design to incorporate the latest advances so that it will not become obsolete..AMD took 5 years to come up with brand new synergistic cpu, gpu, apu, and infinity fabric architectures..What AMD did with EPYC, Ryzen, Vega, and their new Ryzen/Vega APU products is something that Intel can't even try to do since it lacks high-end GPU IP and patents and NVIDIA can't do because they lack high-end CPU IP and patents..AMD APU's are the secret sauce of future success for AMD.. it can be used in servers (once they are MCM scaled), laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc..  AMD native HSA APUs is what Intel needed to conquer smartphones and the tablet business.. but Intel failed because they don't have high-end GPU technology to build native APUs..  Intels current EMIB packaging process using AMD Vega high-end GPUs is just a temporary patch that helps Intel profits from not collapsing..AMD is a great company with great unique synergistic products that will conquer a great amount of cpu, gpu, and apu market share over the next couple of years with no competition in the native scalable HSA APU areas..",

"Been in and out of AMD since $1.89.  Went to Costco yesterday.  Interestingly, every single laptop (there were 13 on display) had ""intel inside"".  That, my friends, is a very real problem....  AMD's roadmap seems to have a lot of potholes.  This stock is best for traders, like the author, because the company is not getting respect for its earnings or margins and gets bounced around like it's hanging in the wind.  There is an ""opportunity cost"" with every competing investment.  Not sure I can keep justifying my position much longer....",

"If Q1 2019 sees AMD releasing 7nm Epyc CPUs and Intel NOT releasing corresponding 10nm CPUs, which is probable, a significant paradigm shift will occur. Shorting Intel will be 'game on' while shorting AMD will be an act of insanity.Intel would be behind AMD on process node, core count, single core performance, memory capacity, PCIe lanes, power, efficiency, die cost and security. Intel's margins and market share would face the reaper's scythe. AMD's would be fat and sassy.",

Besides AMD being over-hyped by Perma-Bulls on these articles, the constant denial that the lawsuit would be won, Austin Craig just verified AMD is going to pay out to settle it.Do you think that will drive the stock up?  No, down.  I see no end to this, and I continue to get margin calls I've been able to appreciate out of, but with the patterns this seems to be developing, many see this correction as NOT ending yet, and many are stating that we have further downside.But, every day, when companies report and go up, most of them lose it all.  Not a good sign.",
"$29.5 was already settled it is a non issue now. too small anyway to be considered. Specter and Meltdown related law suits are just ambulance chasers. First, there are hardly any losers left, and if there are any the window of the lawsuit and valuation doesn't make any sense. wishful thinking on the part of Ambulance chasers. It is difficult to prove the loss was attributable to Specter or Meltdown as neither have had any material impact on the stock during the class period. Same is true for Intel, only CEO sold virtually all his shares except for what he was required to hold. Lawyers can try to prove intent to use material insider information for trading decisions as at the time of sale, the selling CEO may have expect the stock price to react negatively. In AND a case, the CEO holds a sizeable portion, what was sold was in a plan established long before the Specter/Meltdown News.Short if you must but at these levels there is more chances of a successful long trade vs a short trade. Better win/loss ratio for going long",
one of the best articles. need patience.,
"It is funny to always hear AMD Intel wars when they are mentioned. Like the stock market, this market is not a zero sum game. Both can do quite well and have been doing well. One should look at the market which has been growing for quite a while and may continue to do so as cars, robotics, and data centers, grow. AMD is fine not focusing on the crypto market. Like the market, it makes business sense not to chase. Just look for the new trend and opportunity. That's what keeps us moving forward.",
"AMD and Nvidia will report  after the bell today they are both falling . I have long warned that program trading will polarized the market and see how much the DOW plunge over 1700 points i a few hours . Only where there is a terrorist attack or sudden outburst of war should triggered such a wild swing. No up for Nvidia, no up for AMD if Nvidia  goes up ,up AMD by a few cents. No good news will not result in upward movement for AMD unless Nvidia move up. When these manipulating practices become wide spread regulator will try and closed the gate it will be too late as investors suffer trillion of dollars in loss. It was the same thing with Maddof who swindled billions of investors money. One lone voice gave the warning and alerted the regulator who dismiss the complaint until it was too late . For that experience trader he noticed the irregular trading pattern,  Maddof  was winning on all trade he executed in the market place 100% success. The experience trader simple said that was impossible you cant trade on the market and win on every trade. So we are saying AMD and Nvidia are separate entity and defy trading logic even if the  company was on the verge of bankruptcy it should not mirror Nvidia . some one is control both stock from a common source.",

Disney is below its true value....I’m my book anyway........with up coming movies I think it will be 20% higher by year end.,
"Disney has the Greatest diversity and content in the entertainment industry with 4 strong divisions any company would envy and a license and trademark windfall few can match and what can always be relied on for revenue and is a constant go to source. With the Fox Deal they simultaneously get access to All of the Planet of the Apes Movies, the Tv Series and Cartoon series as well as the Chipmunks, Ice Age, Simpsons and Family guy, Etc.Etc.... not to mention the incredible Fox Movie library since it's long storied inception!! If streaming ever goes mainstream Disney will be the choice and the Residuals, Licensing, Merchandising, Park and Production potential of these properties alone here and over-seas is remarkable.  It's absolutely wild that a company making 9 billion a year with no bottom line drop-off of any kind is not seen for it's true worth while companies like Domino's pizza has it's share price at the 200 a share mark for barely earning 200 million last year!! As a matter of fact the combined yearly profits of Netflix and Domino's is 500 million something Disney does on one single Film!! It's a joke that Disney a soon to be 100 year old company with no bottom line weakness who has done everything to address what investors complained about in what is still a niche streaming market financially(Netflix for all the Ballyhoo is making 300 million while spending 9 billion this year, accruing debt of all kinds) and then gets penalized for doing so??? Even if Espn who is still bringing in big money by the way fell off the face of earth Disney would still be a 7 billion dollar company. Espn is greatly expanding world-wide and has a great streaming potential within Europe, Latin America, India and China with it's billions and billion of people. With The Fox Deal and Tax Breaks coming which is a pipeline of fresh freed up money and opportunities of all kinds on all fronts Disney should be seen as the adaptation and growth king! They have to many major assets and markets to be seen as anything else!!",

It's hard for management to steer the octopus.When it does make an across the board improvement in performance it should trade quite nicely. In the meantime, it is pretty safe at its current price long term if you're scared of the sky falling.",

"It would not be unreasonable to see T unload 5-10% of any merger assets acquired.  This includes Time Warner and DTV assets (Latin America).  With assets unloaded in 2017 the total dispositions could total $20 billion over 2017 and 2018, assuming the Court sides with T.This would result in a net cost of $10 billion less for DTV and $10 billion less for Time Warner.Also, T received a great deal of data spectrum from the Federal government along with $6 billion in cash over six years to build out the emergency network over 20-25 years.  It is estimated that the states and Federal government will only use 1-2% of the spectrum which allows T to allocate this space to businesses across the U.S.  T paid nothing for this space.I expect total debt to be $20 billion less within one year of any acquisition of Time Warner rather than the total debt that many say is too much debt taken on for both the DTV and Time Warner buys.",

You're getting back in dividends payments on what you've lost in principal.Just look at many who are in T for that nice fat divvy.... While the monthly income is great, many have watched it drop and drop and drop and drop to the point that it may take years to just break even.T isn't a bad security.

Given the downturn in the market T has held up well still above 35..err make that 36.  T is and has been range bound 34-38 and for most of us that is fine as I like the dividends and the safety of T.   T is an anchor in most portfolios.

"Where it is said ""considering the sell off T has held up well as expected""---if you look at the numbers T has registered a greater percent loss than the Dow the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ and QQQs during this recent downdraft.  Please tell me how this is reasonably well.....As an additional point, I was an original TCOMA holder since 1968. Received 23 currently trading publicly traded securities. T was acquired  by me when it purchased DTV  {TCOMA  converted to LMCA) with Malone's companies the largest shareholders. As a result, I received T in 2014  and my tax basis is less than 25 cents....That is why I still own it. It has been my worst performer since it was acquired......Malone had a previous iteration with T back in 2000 when he sold Cable to C. Michael Armstrong's T.  That didn't work out well either...Yes, I get a dividend. Total return has been abysmal.  Safety has also strayed. To be real honest, T is a stock that under performs in strong up markets and also under performs when markets go down.  T is no longer the 1980s monopoly that was safe for widows and orphans. This is a very highly leveraged company that operates on thin margins with large capital costs, significant regulation and fierce competition. It has entered new markets (e.g. Video --thru DTV acquisition) where it has not performed as senior management assumed when the spent more than $50 Billion, levered up the balance sheet, and diluted the existing shareholders.",
"Q7 - Well written balanced T article describing the Good and Bad of T. T is up today but in reality for us long time T holders who really cares about stock price?      ""Historically, 92% of the time T's share price has moved back into its normal trading range of $35.64 to $35.74."" as per fidelity alerts....I am in the camp that thinks the tax cuts and merger will a positive catalyst for T.  Won't know for about a year on how much T will add to profits due to the tax cuts but it should be significant.  Hopefully they use the proceeds to pay down debt.    Considering the sell off T has held up very well as predicted.   Investors like safe stocks when corrections occur...a flight to safety..    My cost basis on the long time shares I hold forever is easily less than 10 per share ""not including dividends"" paid over the years...  I don't worry about T.  When I see 33/34 I buy more and when I see 37/38's I sell a little bit.....rinse and repeat.  In the meantime  I collect 5+% dividends.",
another down day,
How can any one claim T has excellent management. Remember the $4Billion payout for T-Mobile. The $50Billion plus for DTV. Leo Hindery ran DTV with every increasing cash flow and subscribers. T took over and has seen falling subscribers and falling revenue and falling video margins. T management is really good at rewarding themselves. Shareholders---not so much. ...Current interest rate environment is that rates are rising. T will be refinancing at substantially higher rates--don't know how that is a positive. When the merger does go thru there will be nearly 1 billion shares issued to holders of TWX. Watch out below... Some of the posts here seem to indicate that the T that many people think they are investing in is not the T that trades on the New York Stock Exchange.,
Will have to reduce the debt quickly.,
I would feel better if the debt level was below 100 billion.,
While the debt is high the current interest rate environment is a plus and that much of the increase in debt was for long term infrastructure which means that it is not an ever growing amount of debt.The dividend payouts are still well covered by cash flow from operations and have a greater potential to be increased rather than cut.

I'm still in the black from cost basis, but every passing day I bang my head against a wall as to why I didn't sell after earnings. Worst performing stock I currently hold in my portfolio (only drags down returns). The second worst performing stock I can at least attribute to the proverbial buy the rumor and sell the news. I keep telling myself it's for the long term dividend, but I can only convince myself so much day after day. Glad I reduced my stake a few weeks ago. Especially with Ts debt and the fact they are trying to acquire TW. TW will add value and help the dividend, but management is not going to be able to keep interest if this leads to a cut in the dividend or a stagnant dividend.

Recent trading suggests that shorts are returning to the story despite strong performance from both AAN and RCII and XRT being on the verge of breaking out.  The retail traction is evident, I see zero evidence for the idea that the 2017 securitization is 'much worse than '16', or that '16 will substantially miss their guidance, and at ~9x 2019 estimates, valuation looks very comfortable.

There is a lot of evidence to support the credit improvement story, with Hurricane Harvey as the only wrench in the works, with visible SSS growth recovery in the near future, plus returning to square footage growth.  In this case a 10x multiple will prove way too low - and only assuming a market multiple on the identified street estimates of 2.98/3.79 generates targets of $47.00 up to $60.00 +.

"You are confusing the net loss on the reports to the net loss on the earnings. Those are calculated differently and it is VERY material. I suggest you read every single disclosure the company has posted since 2015 and revisit your assertion that they are equal, which seems to be the crux of your entire thesis.",
"JC Here. I rebranded as I'm prepping to write some articles.I actually agree with all the analysis in this article despite coming to a different conclusion on the share price.There's a couple key points here:(1) yes the static loss rates are worse than advertised; my own model has the Q1 & Q2 of FY17 vintages topping out north of 17%(!!!), but the movement since then has been dramatically better, and the leading indicators -- aside from reaged accounts which were the result of Hurricane Harvey -- are all trending toward further improvement on a static pool basis.(2) there's a HUGE accounting issue that is not well understood and how that relates to CONN's published GAAP numbers both on the income statement and the balance sheet. They report provision for loan losses on the balance sheet as the estimated chargeoffs over the next 12 months, NOT on a net basis against all future chargeoffs which is what everyone else reports. Essentially, they're delaying the recognition of credit losses until they get within the 12 month window of the chargoff event even if they know that on a static basis that chargeoffs will be xx%. The upshot is that the improvement on the P/L from improved underwriting is also delayed significantly from when the actual economic losses are incurred.(3) part of my bullishness is centered around the timing of when the GAAP figures start reflecting the benefit of improved underwriting, and we are starting to see improvement there. That improvement will continue far into the future provided there aren't any significant hiccups in underwriting that aren't public yet. For clarity, my model estimates actual economic losses and what the reserve should be assuming all static losses are recognized at origination, and then I compare that against the GAAP numbers. And I spot check my model by walking forward each static vintage 4 quarters into the future to see if the dollar values line up with the reserve on the balance sheet (they do). Suffice it to say that chargeoffs are turning a corner and are starting to fall (as are delinquencies, FINALLY), and that trend will accelerate the further we get from the worst vintages (Q1-Q2 FY17).(3) the interest expense is a crucial component here, and yes the rising LIBOR and FED FUNDS rates will hurt CONN on the margin as their assets are fixed rate but their funding is variable rate. But... there has been, and will continue to be, massive improvement in credit spreads on their paper. The market is basically pricing the ABS's as junk paper, and the A & B tranches have virtually zero default risk, and the C paper is pretty well protected as well. Spreads have been coming down by percentage points rather than basis points, and that's going to contribute tens of millions of dollars in YoY interest expense improvement.(4) likewise, the interest revenue is continuing to tick up as a greater percentage of the portfolio is priced at 29.99%. They just finished converting the rest of their stores a few months ago, and it will take the better part of 2 years to work off the old loans at the lower rates. That's going to provide a tailwind to interest income for a very long time.(5) lastly, this last piece is somewhat squishy, but I think sentiment will change when CONN's reports full year earnings and releases guidance for next year. They're going to start opening new stores again, and the narrative will be that (1) earnings will see dramatic growth year over year (in excess of 100%), and retail sales will start growing again as underwriting stabilizes and new stores come online. The drop in credit losses, increase in interest income and retail sales, and and the drop in interest expense are all going to be occurring simultaneously, and the Street is going to price in some pretty strong EPS growth over the next 2-3 years, and CONN will end up getting a higher P/E multiple because of the growth narrative.",

"Bossco,Pursuant to leading 2018 production schedule outlook, all of the runs are profit maximized units per quarter production to achieve highest margin and lowest production cost over full run.  Any production schedule I propose is based on any number of Intel volume cost : price models I am aware. I have to assume any foundry whether GoFlo or TSMC or OSAT will attempt, and AMD will press to attempt not only effective but efficient production. I concur fabrication/test/package ultimately claim that schedule. Where AMD and customers lead production schedule with their volume commitments only then pays for time to market, time to volume assumes time to yield.https://seekingalpha.c...Pursuant this report, note I do not detail any of the individual production runs in their quarterly volumes are all profit maximized on Intel volume phase model(s). You can see those actual runs and runs and models throughout my blog post Series 'Views of Intel Monopolization' show production wave forms, time to yield and by grade SKUs yield for Core and Xeon volumes.One of the issues, pursuant net margin, concerns whether AMD negotiated any cut of foundry and OSAT marginal cost improvement through the run. My belief is AMD did not, subsequently does not share in that marginal revenue improvement goes to production. Means back to the negotiating table to receive some marginal revenue gain for mutually dependent production cost improvement?Intel is just transforming to demand based production. Intel still competes as a supply side design producer. Everything AMD is custom, demand based scheduling on AMD, customer or 3rd party equity to finance supply. If that financial commitment lags or is commensurate purely with demand, effective production lags.  Assessing AMD channel supply that shows multiple channel niche stronghold strategies and head to head grade SKUs competition, I believe AMD is competing on both demand based scheduling and supply based financial commitments to carve out defensible product category positions. This means uniquely differentiated products have sufficient market acceptance for production and supply chain to take that financial risk including vis-à-vis Intel methods of monopolizing development manpower and supply chain financial resource to consume channels as competitive barrier and monopolistic limiter.I do not believe any of the volume statements I've proposed aggressive but essential to creating a core of channels support too tough for Intel to crack.My AMD gross/net is still based on component list value / 3; 1/3 to foundry/OSAT, 1/3 to AMD and another 1/3 to customer channel margin; reoccurring board NRE and profit. When the AMD end customer value is less, because there is no board development or volume procurement is lower, some of that 1/3 customer reserve stays with AMD as gross.I believe AMD does secure a greater percentage split of the overall component margin in retail channel procurements. For PC OEM/IDM procurement AMD receives less component value includes competing with Intel purchase incentives which gets back to unique and differentiated products.Mike Bruzzone, Camp Marketing",
"""Epyc will drive gross margin up still the foundries and OSATs will take a big chunk of that gross revenue increase.""Yes and they control the production ramp rates as well.

"Bossco,This is a really good question that has me thinking since earlier in the day,""How about proving to us ""unaware"" types that AMD is capable of generating reasonable net margin from their impressive revenue growth?""We're all aware contributors I was referring to Docket 9341 and related investigations known concealed. I've offered industry production economic research sample in my blog stock talks section.:My top of mind thought is a reduction in variable cost(s).  Epyc will drive gross margin up still the foundries and OSATs will take a big chunk of that gross revenue increase. I'm estimating more than AMD gross share of component value but will revisit that in the future. On the opposite end of foundry price, the price of purchase incentives can be regulated by Intel and I'm on that advocating antitrust remedies for a very long time. The lower the sales package incentives the higher the gross at least.  There's always the question whether reclaimed dice are worth that investment when down big grades are given away in sales package. I personally believe AMD should get out of quad CPU sales on Intel control of that space. Duals are obviously obsolete on the Intel surplus crush. Four and six core surplus I'd get out of that business except when graphics are integrated on hexa core die. Packaging cost is increasing.. .  .AMD Inventory holding is a variable cost I associate mostly with obsolete product..I believe AMD is applying around $4 cost charge per unit of production to offset that inventory loss.I've stated concern with AMD cost of sales per unit in the past.I'll keep thinking on this and invite your thoughts.Mike Bruzzone, Camp Marketing",

"This Market Meltdown may actually be good for AMD. I just listened to Dan Niles , a well known analyst, and he said he is not interested in Nvidia ,even after good earnings, because its valuation is way too stretched particularly in this market condition. With Interest rates rising more importannce will be given to metrics like Price/Sales and Growth Rate. Nvidia has been growing for last few years. This growth rate cannot be maintained. AMD is coming from a very low market share. Nvidia is 10 times larger than AMD in GPU and Intel is 80 times larger in CPU. However now AMD has better products then before and many of them are differentiated from competition. So AMD has much faster future Growth rate with lower Price/Sales valuation currently. As market becomes normal , I expect AMD stock price rising faster then Nvidia or Intel. AMDs revenue will be between 7b and 9b in 2018, more likely will be 8b and Gross Margin growth nearing 40%.

"Too many DCF valuations, it looks like very easy for people to scribble at the back of a napkin or open a spreadsheet and figure out some mubo jumbo numbers and convoluted logic to come up with some valuation.

Only flaw was, he never accounted for the valuation going up given the reduced share count over the same period. However, his computation was based on current value and how the same $$$s can be used to purchase Apple stock over next 5 years.Hopefully, the CFO of Apple is not reading his note. Likewise, all the DCF valuations I have read on SeekingAlpha about AMD are plain stupid. Better to look at an 8 ball and come up with some valuation.How do you even know if AMD is going to be a stand alone independent Company over the timeframe you evaluate. What if Micron decides to buyout AMD so they can get a better multiple on their own stock, moving away from a commodity business to a better mix.

Eps will be around 0.50 to 0.60 (Interest expenses will also go down because of lower debt)If we are bit optimistic and consider double digit growth in server market as mentioned down below we get2018 revenue as 9079m which is 70% above 2017. If this happens AMD will have 0.75 as eps in 2018, 2 years ahead of projection given earlier by AMD.If we take eps=0.50 then stock price = 0.50*30=$15If we take eps=0.60 then stock price = 0.60*30=$18If we take eps=0.75 then stock price = 0.75*30=$22.5I was worried ,before Q4 earnings, that AMD had inventory problems.

I think AMD will reach the goal in 2018 and will not have to wait till 2019 as Lisa Su mentioned in prepared statement during Q4 that AMD will gain double digit server market share in 2018. AMD will have an EPS of around 0.10*4 + 17=57c. Taking a P/E of 30 gives a stock price of $17 for 2018""Forbes goes further and estimates the global server CPU shipments in 2019 to reach 26 million, meaning a 10% market share gain will imply 2.6 million server CPUs shipped. Therefore, the incremental server revenue will be roughly $1.4 billion ($550 for average processor pricing in server industry). This push, would increase AMD’s EBITDA by $250 million (18% EBITDA margin) and lead to incremental earnings of $160 million, or 17 cents per share. This, in turn, would imply a 25% jump in EPS in 2019.""",

I hold some cldx but worried the Glemba Metric study will be negative. The comparator is Xeloda which has a very good efficacy profile itself in triple neg breast cancer. The Metric study was initiated based on the strong glemba efficacy in Emerge. However in Emerge the comparator arm had no patients on Xeloda at all. Basically there’s no head to head previous data glemba vs Xeloda whatsoever. It also seems to me Cldx has no confidence in the Metric trial either.,
Agree. the current price assumes failure of the triple neg. Breast Cancer study.TNBC is a difficult indication.Not many options here.,
"Was writing about Celldex at essentially the same time and came to essentially the same conclusion. I like your 3 slides breaking down approval rates. While Glemba is the focus, I think Varlilumab has some value. While the Glemba Phase 2 trial is randomized and has enough patients in it for potential FDA approval, the bar is high. Most likely scenario is positive results, but still a need for a full Phase 3 trial. Downside is relatively small at the current price, but even though the price seems to assume failure, you can bet the price will fall further if the outcome is negative. Thanks for writing.",
You said that Cldx has nothing in final stages of development then went on to say they could file for approval on Glemba results. Fact is Glemba is an open label study designed by FDA and won’t require a phase 3 so Glemba is actually in final stages of development,

"This is a very nice summary, but I have a few quibbles...Your WACC is way to low. FELP's most junior bonds have a YTM of around 12%; it's illogical to think that equity would have a required return less than that. Required return on equity is probably more like 15-20%, maybe higher, which would get you closer to current market prices. FELP can certainly get to $10, but that will require materially higher domestic or export prices for ILB coal. On the export side, current API 2 prices haven't helped FELP because of increased sulfur discounts and increased shipping costs; export netbacks were actually down as API2 rallied from $75 to $95. Also, I wouldn't put to much hope in that CME ILB chart, those futures never trade (as in I don't think a single ILB contract has ever traded on CME).On the positive side, Murray's sub units are still deeply out of the money. For all intents and purposes, FELP's share count can be cut in half, although not for upside cases. The only near term catalysts I can think of are, 1) large Hillsboro insurance payment or  2) Less Marcellus gas production (Dominion South/ Henry Hub basis tightens). FELP will definitely be the best name to own if the ILB situation turns.",

Great detailed analysis.  Thank you for writing it.,
Outstanding summary.  Unfortunately most of the lack of market discipline in the ILB can be laid directly at the feet of Murray/Foresight. They plan on producing 3.5 million from the Armstrong mines they are acquiring out of bankruptcy which will further erode ILB pricing.Thanks again for the detailed article.,

"Something that surprise me is that many investors fail to notice  that Pandora produces 5 times more jewellry than the worlds second largest producer of branded jewellry. The jewellry industry is heavily fragmented and Pandoras largest (by sales value) competitors are retailers who are heavily reliant on luxury items for special occations such as engagement rings. Pandora is currently dominant in charms & bracelets but they are expanding rapidly in more mainstream segments such as rings and necklaces. Those sales are going very well and there is noone who can compete with Pandora in terms of scale, logistics and omnichannel capacity.",
Maybe you're forgetting that they are targetting growth between 7-10% the next five years. So historical growth rates are probably not indicative of the future,
This is the highest conviction name in my portfolio. I just wonder what those short sellers are thinking. It seems to be very hard to make a short case at this price level.,
For some reason there is no option of liking an article on Seeking Alpha? Would have liked.Agree. Pandora is a great company and currently undervalued.,
A great business at a great price. Pandora is able to grow profit with very little increase in its assets and also distributes almost all of its cash. A very rare find in today's markets.,

"Jonathan, HCV is the leading infectious disease for causing death.  Many other diseases cause more deaths.  Also, many of those new HCV infections are in the newly injecting drug using community as part of the opioid epidemic.  Very few of these individuals have medication coverage to access Gilead drugs, unless it will be HIV therapy via federal programs.  HCV will continue to provide some nice revenue, but not a real source of growth.  The same is true of Yescarta with its current indication.  There will need to be significant label expansion for Yescarta to provide significant growth.  That will be the focus for cell therapy.  Hopefully, we don't have to wait as long for the next major acquisition as we did for Kite.  Not many have that kind of patience any longer.",
That 25 B is good bonus money for the M&G team,

"GILD has pretty much bet the farm on KITE oncology pipeline making up for the declining HCV market.  That may pay off big time, only they know what tricks KITE has up it's sleeve, but there are a lot of competing sciences at play in this area and it is easy to see that one or more of these from a competitor may do a ""hail mary"" pass into the end zone, which would be a great thing for science and health care, but be a major shock to GILD's strategy and investment in this area.",
"Good article Jonathan.  The sooner HCV falls, the sooner growth resumes.  I'm hoping that they are accurate in their $3.5-4.0 B guidance for HCV this year, as the decline next year might only be perhaps $1.0 B.  I estimate Yescarta revenues at $0.5 B this year, which would amount to 1300 patients being treated.   Growth in HIV+others should result in overall revenues increasing next year.  On the other hand, if HCV were to only fall to say $5.0-6.0 B this year (from $9.1 B last year), then overall revenue growth wouldn't resume until 2020 or later.  So root for HCV to fall as fast as it can.",
"From a humanitarian point of view, I hate to say it, but new HIV infections are likely to significantly increase.  Many states and local communities (including my own, where I am a law enforcement officer) are implementing greater measures to seriously limit dispensing and access to prescription opioids.  While that has an obvious upside of course, a negative effect has been an explosion in the the use of heroin as a substitute drug.  Used, dirty needles are so common, I see them in the field almost daily (on the street and in apartments/homes).  When I speak with health professionals, they are worried not only about obvious overdoses and deaths, but huge potential for a ramp in new HIV infections going forward as government further restricts access to prescription opioids and addicts continue to turn to relatively cheap and easily available heroin and other injected drugs.",

Clearly the analysts aren't paying attention to ALL the conference calls, webcasts, fireside chats, etc.  B'cuz it's my money, I do.  NEWS flash:  Micron wants to eliminate inventory RISKS by inventing NAND (and DRAM?) that will be compatible for PC, server, mobile et cetera.  For Micron stockholders, that means if PCs enter a bust cycle, Micron won't get stuck with PC NAND in inventory getting worthless that Micron will have to write down, ** OR ** sell in the spot market undermining spot and contract pricing. With DRAM and NAND that is compatible across industries, Micron can feed the most demand without tying up money in inventory... leaving the competition in the dust.

"continued volatility, margin calls and overall fear and the talking heads on CNBC and Fox business provide the fire for more fear and the market doesn't care at this point if a company trades at 50x or 6x. Except if you are NVIdia, I'm astonished with the continued strength of that company, but the P/E is insane.also please realize that the trip down in the past few days can accelerate and can make 2008 look small. Don't forget we went from 13000 to 6600 back then. We are at 24000 down from 26600 and that's only  a 10% drop.   If we climb into a bear market because of all the outside influences as some are talking of, then we could see all gains since the election go bye byeright now I remain pessimistic about the markets after this weeks acton. Mob mentality and casino mentality has settled in during the past few months and TRUMP pushing the market successes has helped people who were on the sidelines jump in. How do you think they feel today seeing their accounts in the red. So many stayed on the sidelines getting  .0025 on bank rates since the great recession and now felt with Trump the market would go to the moon, but there is a real world and markets that climb this high this fast usually have a fast ride down and it can be very painful making the next leg up harder to achieveIm still in MU but I think moving forward I will be looking at AAPL, Intel and some safer dividend stocks like JNJ, T and MO",
"I sold 1/2 my position the other day when they preannounced and expect the markets to continue down for the next few weeks taking MU with it.  Worries of inflation, the debt skyrocketing with last nights budget deal, a market that has gone to far during the past 13 months and higher interest rates in the future will cause people to rethink their investments in stocks.  Too many retail investors came into this market during the past few months(inflows) and this week saw the largest outflow. Not goodMU's pre annoucement earlier in the week and INTELs news and NVIDIAs news today was all good, but now is old news, so whats to help support the stock price???I think MU is a great investment long term and damn cheap but the market forces are negative and therefore I will jump back in with more $$$ at a lower price. Almost pulled trigger today at  $37 and change but backed away, Market swings are too volatile, Seeing 300 point or more swings several times each day is enough to give you grey hairIntel also looks interesting and may do better in next few months, but its anyones guessGood luck to all",

That was quite the gut punch for a while there.  I think we are now in a volatile down trend. In the past, if you made a mistake on a trade, you could just hang on for a bit and it would come back and all was good. I think now there is still some trading money to be had but mistakes will not fix themselves at the moment. Hopefully this will turn better but I don't think mu or any stock at the moment is going to be able to swim upstream in these market wide sell offs. As much as this seems like a good value, it will drop further if the market tanks. I really didn't figure we would get back to the 37's, especially after the pre announcement. I suspect that we are in the early rounds of this volatility and there are definitely some more gut punched to come. Keep some dry powder to take advantage and don't get greedy on a winning trade as things turn very quickly.",

The reason NVDA keeps going higher is because mostly institutions and hedgies are invested in it not many retail investors because price is so high. On the other hand MU is low priced so their are many retail investors. They don't like many retail investors in a stock so they have to beat it down.,

Depending on how badly you've been burned there are people who won't touch the name any more for any reason.

Kumquat - in your article you did not mention any projection of debt and did not get the cash correct.

On Tesla.Are they in phase 3 or 4 of this experiment or are there 2 more phases before they are gone,well, let us give them 2 more for the benefit of the doubt.But, funny like bitcoin if you have 1 billion people believing in it and they invest just a 100 dollars each, wow, you have a lot of money there and if you got in after 300 million invested wow, what a profit, for sure.anyways, spade to spade, the company is not gone really, but yes in a short while their assets will be picked up by others and all in all there is no way this set up ever can compete with China and even the other large autos in USA, what is the difference?? they have the liquidity and cash and like you are saying this Company is running out of cash and yes, cheap money is over so soon, it will be down and down.excellent article. From Denmark.",
"As reported, Tesla burns and waste cash and may very well go bankrupt, but what's your (and others for that matter) opinion of the wider EV market moving forward?I Is the 'genie out of the bottle' so to speak because we are seeing a lot of major companies make noise about wanting to phase out the combustion engine sooner than later. How much of this 'speeding up' of the process can be attributed to Tesla (perhaps even Musk)? Or is Tesla's business model indicative of where the market stands regarding it? It's confusing but I was told just last night by a portfolio manager (who had a very sober but positive take on the EV market. ie Tesla can go bankrupt but EV is real) that the demand for the Model 3 is huge yet the company can't deliver it but it's all moot because the EV is here to stay.",
"Forget Q4.  It's over.  Check out Norway now.  http://teslastats.noRemember Q1 2017 sold a bunch in Hong Kong to perhaps ""shell companies"" and sales since have been nearly nil.  Seems to have happened in Q4 2017 in Norway.And with the exit of Sales manager Jon McNeil, maybe he arranged some of those big block deals in Q4 and knows they're not coming back in Q1 2018.I would worry more about Q1 than anything else.  Model 3 ramp is still slow, quality issues, people getting asked to configure earlier than they had thought they would and seemingly lower sales in key markets like Norway.",
"I had always impression that Tesla and other Musk companies are not market/economic entities but political projects of US elite. They all cover projects activities where US strugle for long time with goverment/scientific/b... money to achieve something and didn't achieve nothing or evel less then nothing (just look at the field of the rockets where US had to rely on Soviet era rockets before Musk appear).So, When you evaluate Musk projects you have to take in concern what were US elite alternatives to Musk's enterprises.Musk is not profitable (yet and maybe ever been), but progress is evident and cost much less then state funded loosers.",
"Thank you for the update, Montana Skeptic. Regarding the timing of your article, you certainly nailed it in the most humble way possible :)As expected, the conference call was a ""mumbled"" mess. It seems though, way less spectacular promises were made compared to the ones in the past. This maybe a sign that, after investor opinion, public opinion about TSLA is also getting less forgiving. Model 3 customers want their share of attention, but the CEO is taking it all for itself and his rockets. Not so faithful disciples after all.On a other note, not related to this article, i feel there is a important part of the discussion missing. I learned a lot here on SA and i am immensely grateful to some people here, contributors and commenters aswell. That being said, im even more surprised when i see some of those people attributing some invincibility to the CEO and the companys prospects in the credit markets. And of course the CEO's ""ability"" to move the stock. So, im reading a clever article why to short TSLA but the take away is ""due to the CEO's ability to boost the stock to infinity and endless refinancing abilities, it can go forever"". How is this thinking rational. It is the same mindset as the most fanatical long.In the last 5 trading sessions there were numerous tweets, a rocket launch and a conference call. If one really think this nonsense drove the stock, please go to your terminal, plot TSLA against ES or your favorite index future and think again. Do this for the most important stock moves over the past 5 years and it will still hold true. Of course, there are some tweets which made a sizable contribution to the upside but if the stock reacts less then a second after the tweet, the chance that it wasnt a long term TSLA holder trading it, is, lets put it diplomatically, high. The real magic would be to stop a downtrend with a tweet, which so far wasnt the case. It shows how small even a rocket launch can become in the grand scheme of things. It seems there are few actual traders here on SA and the complete absence of the sell side shows. Talk to any trader/manager which runs a momentum based strategy and his eyes will start to glow if you mention TSLA and it is not because of the Model 3 or any future prospect of the company. What im trying to say, the price action to the up- and downside seems to be defined by factors not in direct relation to TSLA, which of course is true for a lot of tech/growth/most shorted stocks. No one knows how many supporters this company has, but judging its future prospects by price action generated by people like myself wont make for a good forecast. It should be articles like this, moving the stock. But as long as FED jawboning, VIX ETF's and USDCNH have more influence on TSLA and the stock market then earnings, one should be honest to himself even if it means admitting even less control over your investments. I truly enjoy your articles and the people you are attracting, thank you.",
"Hi Montana,How do you think a capital raise would work in your opinion? Debt is obviously off the table with their 2025 bond prices and it would only tighten the noose around them. How do they place 20 million shares to keep them going another year? What would that look like logistically? Just curious from your experience. I am shocked Elon has waited so long but I guess he knows what 20 million extra shares would do to the trading price. Not to mention all the stock comp they print.",
"Many people like to highlight Tesla's loss per car, as if it could be an important metric.  OK, let's have a look.

Again, just to see the underlying trend, here are the numbers with ZEV credits stripped off.Q1 $13.2kQ2 $20.0kQ3 $23.7kQ4 $28.6kSome people would say that this is all you need to know about the company.",

That is all old auto except Tesla and they have agreed to move into a free trade zone and will NOT be required to share EV IP Or 50/50 profits. 9. No analysis on Tesla's aggressive automation capabilities or how old auto is locked into multi year/decade labor contracts precluding total automation. 10.

"Cramer just ripping Musk today""he is better than David Blaine""",
On the conference call Musk deflected by gong on about cars not being made as fast as his grandma could walk??  It made absolutely no sense but kept from spending time on real issues like quality control and no one answering service calls.  The Space X launch may have kept the earnings report from mattering had the market not imploded.  However the market did and Tesla went with it. BOOM,
"Congrats CoverDrive on the estimates. I don't know how one does it. Looks to me like collateralized lease borrowing has gone way down over the last 2 quarters.  Is Tesla going more the way of direct leasing now?  I wonder why the change, or is it really a change?",

"Oddly, today's news may not affect the number of Tesla reservations right away.  That depends on the short term not arriving too soon.  Deliveries are another question that we will skip for now.  As to most products, consumers and investors are different breeds.  The latter know how to grow rich:  Buy and hold shares of Brown & Haley, but don't eat tubs of Almond Roca.  Or buy and hold shares of Anheuser-Busch, but don't drink kegs of Budweiser.  Most consumers of both hardly know or care.With Tesla it's different.  That brand [for now] builds cult cars and offers cult stocks, with some commonality of consumers and investors.  The former hope to save money by recouping part of the car's high price in dribs and drabs of saved expenses over coming years.  The latter had planned to buy low and sell high.  Some will succeed at that, and their followers next day will end up having bought low and sold lower.  Or bought high, etc.  Many Tesla Model 3 reservation holders will get lucky by NOT having their cars delivered, leaving them only their deposit of $1,000 in the red, with part of it perhaps recoverable.  Soon also, they'll find recent Models S and X as well as 3 for sale dirt-cheap, whoever may want them.There's another guess out of many.",

Elon Musk during the conference call reminded me of Prez Bone Spurs speaking at one of his rallies...generalities and misleading statements are the norm in both venues,
"One of the things I like to parse out of the earnings statement is the Gross Margin by product line.  No tricks, no assumptions, just calculations based on Tesla's reported numbers.  I calculate automotive margins with and without ZEV credits so that quarterly trends can be identified.Tesla reports revenue/COGS independently for auto sales and auto leasing.  Auto leasing continues to have the highest GM of any product line.  It was at 34.6% this quarter, about the average for 2017.  So far so good.But when you combine leases with sales to get the total automotive picture, the view is not so pretty.  GM was running over 27% for the first half of the year, but has dropped to under 19% in the second half.  To get a better idea of the trend, these are the GM's by quarter after subtracting out ZEV credits.Q1 27.4%, Q2 24.5%, Q3 18.3%, Q4 13.2%Some people will immediately see the trend; others will not.We can also break out Tesla Energy.  Its GM was at 5.5%, down from 25.3% last quarter.  What's up with this? Are they getting paid in Australian dollars?And finally, there is Services and Other.  Its GM was at -30.7%, down from -20.7% last quarter.  Mostly due to used car sales?  I think so.Overall, how's business?  Quarterly GM including ZEV:Q1 24.8, Q2 23.9%, Q3 15.0%, Q4 13.2%Next quarter?  Hmmm... may have to discuss that with the Skeptic.",
"Quoted in The Economist: ""Christian Hoffmann of Thornburg, an investment firm, calls buying Tesla shares on the basis that Mr Musk will quickly solve its problems a “James Bond trade”: “He needs to dodge the avalanche, avoid the gunfire, ski off the cliff, pull the ripcord and glide to safety so that he can save the world.”""Should be a good show either way! Might buy a few movie tickets once I close my short trade.http://econ.st/2BLV8df - a fair and balanced view of the challenges and opportunities that Tesla faces.",
"The three-sentence ""forecast"" is most revealing.First, a ""target"" is not a ""forecast.""  A target is simply aspirational, while a forecast is something that is expected.  This contrasts sharply with Tesla's actual forecast from Jan. 3:  ""likely ending the quarter at a weekly rate of about 2,500 Model 3 vehicles.""The second sentence clarifies the first; it says that Tesla normally misses its targets.The third sentence is the real forecast; it says Tesla expects:  ""these actions should result in our production rate significantly increasing.""  Of course a 10% increase is ""significant.""So, what Tesla has said is that, while they would like to get to 2500/week in the first quarter, they expect to miss that, but at least to improve.This makes sense when Elon announced that Tesla will not actually be installing its battery module assembly line until March. If that installation occurs in March, then it will be at least April before it gets up to speed.  Until then, the current ""semiautomatic"" production will continue, which seems to be capable of less than 1,000 a week.",
"All apple needs to do after buying tesla out is to use it s cash to buy 5 million manufacturing robots and let Musk still lead this arm of business, name it the new economy branch.  Then use the store to show the entire clean energy package.  This will bring new foot traffic to the store and also help with phone, ipad, and other digital hardware.  Perhaps equip tesla cars with Apple products like navigation, car tv, or Amazon echo like products.  I see a lot of synergy there.If not Apple will only go down from here.",
"My thanks go out to all of those who have voiced their appreciation of my forecast.  And thanks to Montana for prodding me to make my spreadsheet highlights public.  After the December forecast, I updated my spreadsheet with the actual sales numbers.  Surprisingly, it had almost no effect on the bottom line because I shaved 1% from gross margin, assuming the increased sales came from discounted inventory.There were two big surprises in the earnings figures.  The good surprise was that ZEV credit sales amounted to a whopping $179M.  And the bad surprise was that gross margins were down significantly more than expected.  The two items effectively cancelled each other on the bottom line, making my prediction look better than it really was.",
"Relative Strength.  As bad as the market correction is now that the Dow is down another 600 points,  TSLA is till up 10% year to date.  This compares favorable with two big techs who have a lot of cash which Tesla doesn't have.  AAPL is -5% year to date and MSFT is 5.2% year to date.  This demonstrates TSLA's relative strength.In fact I would suggest AAPL buy out TSLA right now that its Iphones sales reached platou and will decline in the coming years.  Use the cash and buy it now before the Chinese do it.  We need to keep Tesla here in the US.  AAPL if you are listening, buy out tesla for new growth.  --- lot of synergy since you are basically a hardware company and can use your apple stores (sunken cost) to show Tsla's cars, trucks, solar, tiles, and battery.

As bad as it is, and as bad as the general market has been th elast week or so, Tesla is still at 10% when you started.  Oh wait you may actually started much earlier, at what, $190?  OK lets focus on today, as bad as you bears wanted it look for the quarter, it did not even gap down.  It initially went up, only sliding down with the general the market  with Dow down by 400 points.  I am confident to say if today is a market up day the stock will be up again.  So you bears can have your moment for a couple of days and pat on each other's back (or lick each other's feet your culture warrants so).

Her reasoning, if Elon can launch a roadster into orbit, then he can figure out the production challenges.  I was particularly impressed with how realistic she looked,  but her conclusions seemed..., contrived.  The animatronic hoses and wiring harness betrayed that she was in fact, a Tesladroid, programmed to convincingly spew out tripe.Launching Elon’s roadster into deep space is an excellent use of capital and a true commitment to limiting the carbon footprint.

In the call, we were informed Jon McNeil has left Tesla. Firstly, Elon and the Board paid Jon McNeil handsomely, and obviously believed he should be compensated for the role. However, he has now left the company, with no replacement. The impression given was that Elon would be responsible. I suspect Elon is exceptionally difficult to work with.",

That was a cheap shot at the Falcon Heavy overshooting the Mars orbit.SPACEX had good reason to burn all the fuel in the second stage. That just made the roadster's orbit larger and demonstrated the ability of the the Falcon Heavy to travel the solar system.,

Cash flow from operations total bogus: $500m but $497m came from inventory reduction; how is this possible if they are scaling up production?? Secondly $137m from share options being exercised. Is that cash from operations: its wages! converted into positive cash flow!! I just laugh. Let me give you a guarantee: 1q '18 cashflow will cause shudders down the monetary spine.

"@Montana""Slashed CapEx: Tesla spent $223 million less on capital expenditures than guidance. Something will suffer, whether it be the promised expansion of Service Centers and Superchargers or the capital investments needed to build the Model Y and semi. You can’t be a growth company if you’re not spending money to grow.""The reason for the reduced capex in Q4 is that Tesla already spent what was needed to bring model 3 ramp to 5K/wk, and ramp service and charging infrastructure to support the increased fleet size.  No further capex should occur on that model until the fruits of that investment has been realized. The guidance on 2018 capex is almost the same as 2017 which would include bringing model 3 to 10k/wk as well as bringing model Y, semi and roadster to market.  How do you figure that this is not growth?I don't get you shorts, first you say too much debt, and when they stop spending, you say not enough spending. hypocritical me thinks.",
More of the same negativity. The company is not going out of business. The news media is intentionally failing to report the production targets Q1 and Q2 unambiguously. Most state that the production target for Q1 is 2500 cars instead of 2500 cars per week. Quite a difference!Musk has unequivocally stated that they are on target to hit 2500 model-3's per week production by the end of Q1. He also stated that they are using semi automatic equipment  to achieve that rate of production. Nothing from the news media on this.Musk has stated that the automated production line in Germany is working and will further  increase the production of cars by a factor of 4. The model 3 incremental revenue for the first quarter is  $1 billion dollars. that represents a +30% expansion in gross revenue in a single quarter. Who do we believe the shorts who have been calling fro the demise of the company for years and do not want the company to succeed or the people who are building the company.Old ICE manufacturers are threatened.  This is war and the first casualty of war is truth in the media.It is going to be an interesting quarter.,

"Speaking of margin, we learned from the letter that “Gross margin on used cars sales was close to breakeven.” Car dealers refer to used car sales as a thing called “a profit center.” According to the NADA, 26% of dealer profits are generated in this area.

Tesla FCF was $0.5bn above our ests, driven by workingcapital, customer deposits and less capex. The company enters2018 with ample liquidity and its negative trade cycle shouldsee a boost when the M3 ramps. We think Tesla is fairlyvalued with high risk and potentially peaking expectations.A few thoughts following Tesla's 4Q results:Tesla Inc ( TSLA.O, TSLA US )1. Cash consumption was better than both what we and the marketexpected. Prior to the release of any Tesla quarter, we ask ourselves whatthe one or two biggest factors will be that drive the share price the nextday. In this case, we felt that the pace of cash consumption and theprogress of the Model 3 ramp-up dominated our list of concerns. Tesla'soperating cash flow, net free cash flow and gross cash were all better thanexpected. Capex was $250mm lighter than we expected and workingcapital came in around $500mm better than we had expected, andcustomer deposits increased increased nearly $200mm. This was partiallyoffset by a variety of other factors. The capex dip was helped by sometemporary delays, and it should be expected to ramp again in 1H18. Wethink working capital may remain a factor underestimated by the marketthat will help cash consumption materially through 1H18.2. Automotive gross margin (pre ZEV credits) was weaker than expected.Stripping out $179mm of ZEV credits in 4Q reveals an underlying autogross margin (including stock comp) of 13.2%. This compares to ourforecast of 14.7% excluding the $40mm of ZEV credits that we hadanticipated. Tesla attributed over 100% of its disappointing auto grossmargin to the Model 3 delay.3. FY18 guidance for Model S and X volume is well below our forecast. Teslais targeting around 100k deliveries of combined S and X in 2018 vs. ourforecast of 113k  units. Tesla attributed the flattish YoY development inModel S and X deliveries to constrained supply of its old battery cell formfactor. We reckon Model 3 cannibalization and the age of the Model Swould be reasonably contributing factors. We'd also include an evergrowingsecond-hand vehicle market as another factor to consider.Regardless, Tesla targets an improved gross margin in 2018 on Model Sand X due to mix, options, and lower costs. We would include foreign exchange tailwinds as a positive factor in 2018.4. Tesla reiterates all key milestones on Model 3. Included in Tesla'sreiterated guidance is an expectation of 2,500 M3 units per week by end of1Q and 5,000/week by end of 2Q. We have assumed an average of 667Model 3s per week in 1Q and 2,500 per week for all of 2Q. We do notexpect Tesla to reach a 5k/week level for Model 3 before 2018. Given thelack of visibility and the leap-of-faith nature of such an importantindustrial milestone, we feel it is prudent to apply a handsome discount toTesla's near-term Model 3 volume guidance.Revised down Model S and X volume to 100k from 113k, mostly offset bya 12k unit increase in Model 3 volume to 122k from 110k previously.Modest upward revision in US GAAP Automotive gross margin to 24.3%from 22.6%. The change is is more than 100% accounted for by our higherZEV credit assumptions and FX.Total company US GAAP Operating Profit unchanged vs. our prior forecastof $1bn. Embedded in this forecast is a drop in R&D as a % of sales to 9.0%from 11.7% in 2017 while SG&A falls to 16% from 21% in the prior year(including stock comp).Our 2018 full year free cash flow forecast is negative $2.7bn. While a slightimprovement from 2017 levels, this is nevertheless enough to take grosscash down to $1.2bn by year end.US GAAP EPS loss revised to a loss of ($9.50) from ($8.96) previouslyentirely reflecting higher interest expenses and other expenses.Our 2019 EPS is little changed at a loss of ($1.70) vs. ($1.58 previously)while our 2020 EPS foreacst improves to positive $0.42 from $0.06previously.Price target unchanged at $379. Reiterate EW. Tesla's share price discounts avery significant improvement in profitability, positive cash flow generation andaggressive expansion into a number of adjacent markets (trucks, transportationas a service, automation, etc.). Nearer term, while the Model 3 is still facing adifficult ramp-up period, the company's valuation gives Tesla credit forsubstantially overcoming these challenges. We remain extremely concernedabout competitive pressure in EVs and AVs from the world's largest tech firmsand an inability to access foreign markets (such as China) in a sustainable way.On our math, Tesla shares offer only modest 10%-type upside to fair value.Adjusted for the significant risk inherent in the business we do not believe suchupside justifies anything more than an Equal-weight rating.""",

His automation (467 robots and 21 KL slides for approx 33,000 employees) is slightly more advanced than the standard assembly line (100 robots for 10,000 employees), but nothing to brag about -- frankly, the Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese automation approaches are every bit as good - if not better and since Tesla ""borrowed"" most of its techniques from the Japanese (world leaders in robots and automation), just who are they going to sell this ""product"" to anyhow?

Tesla's paying those at a 60k cars/quarter rate and spreading that 5400 * 60k = 324m ""fixed"" cost over a couple thousand cars.It's probably closer to 200m due to the 800 Model 3s produced but not sold in Q4. More like 800 bpp. That implies S/X gross margin was about 21%. One analyst suggested 20% and they didn't correct him.They talked about a clear path back to 25-26%, which in Tesla-ese means 22-23.

"Well I've been standing on the sidelines. I had a few shares short but covered them a month ago. I started by reading the press release from Tesla. I have to admit it just sounds totally wonderful, gasp. I see how the longs can become so enamored with Elon Musk. I even thought one time about putting in a reservation for a model 3, $35,000 variety. Can't afford any more than that (or at least, that's the max I would spend on a car). But something about an electric car in Minnesota winters just doesn't seem like a good idea to me. As I  paged down the press release, the first thing that caught my eye in the financial tables was current assets of $6.57B versus current liabilities of $9.46B, almost $3B under water. Wow! But then this outlook from Elon Musk ""2018 will be a transformative year for Tesla, with a high level of operational scaling. As we ramp production of both Model 3 and ourenergy products while keeping tight control of operating expenses, our quarterly operating income should turn sustainably positive at some point in 2018."" So he is saying they will achieve positive quarterly operating income in 2018. I know that probably does not mean earnings per share, but still, he gives great hope to shareholders. We all know he will have to do a capital raise very soon. Probably stock. But words will flow, like ""this last 6B of capital should be all we will need, ever!"". I notice there is no going concern language. So this can't be an Enron, right? I think I will heed Montana's continuous warnings about TSLA being a dangerous short. It sure is dangerous, with the pied piper snake charmer saying the words he does. The whole squadron of true believers is watching his roadster and dummy floating above the planet.

The way I see your numbers the number on the right of your table is revenue per share not share value.  To get an estimate of share value you must complete the process. Revenue times some estimate for net profit per share and then multiply that times your estimate of an  eps multiple.  Revenue at $30/share times .7 to get net earning per share times the estimated eps multiple.  30* .7= 21 Earning per share  To get stock price you multiply that by your eps multiple. In my case I would guess that at 25 for a fast growing company. So $21* 25= $525/share  My thoughts!,

KMI earns $7.485 billion in ebitda or about $3.40 per share and expects to earn $2.05 in distributable free cash flow.  EPD sells at 13 x DCF where as KMI sells at 8.5 x DCF.....Enbridge and Transcanada also trade at far higher multiples than KMI and yet KMI is arguably as good as some of these companies and better than many others.  SO, the company is super cheap, suggesting lower real downside and higher upside if the perception of the story changes......and it is going to change.......2.  KMI is transforming.  The $2.05 in DCF means KMI could pay a much higher dividend but is choosing to use the cash for growth and restructure its balance sheet.  KMI intends to grow its asset base without the use of any debt.  In fact, KMI is buying back stock while most pipelines still issue debt and shares to build new projects.  Mean while, the dividend is being raised to .80 in 2 months, then in one more year it is going to $1.00 and then another year out it is expected to be lifted to $1.25.  They dont bother to project any further than that, but it strikes me as highly likely they continue to raise the dividend quickly in 2021 and beyond, getting up over $1.50+ in 2021 or 2022.3.  KMI says their backlog of projects has $1.6 billion additional ebitda protential or a 21% increase from today's current $7.485 billion ebitda.  Yet, KMI does not intend to USE ANY DEBT on their balance sheet to add that additional ebitda....so if they do grow 21% to $9 bilion in ebitda their debt will have remained the same at about $37 billion.  This point is very important as one of the knocks on KMI is that it has too much leverage and its Debt to ebitda is 5.1 while some popular pipelines are leveraged more like 4.5.  Yet, with the new projects and the ebitda growth, then KMI will see its ratio also drop to about 4.5 (37/9 = 4.2 potentially).  To be honest, I dont think the pubic is sophisticated enough to really anticipate this change.  In fact, Enbridge, the largest pipeline in north america has a leverage ratio of 5.1 today and it trades at a much high valuation than KMI....why is that?  Well, ENB never cut its dividend the way KMI did and it yields 5% today....so plenty of people simply own ENB for the yield which is growing nicely but it is not that high....meaning my analysis is unnecessary and all KMI needs to do is lift the damn dividend and the stock will rise.....but I also see the leverage ratio declining and sophisticated investors will then respect KMI all that much more.....so both forces will support a higher stock price......If you bother to focus on my dribble, you will see a company that is strong, has turned its back on using more debt from wall street and is rapidly transforming.  The dividend is going to grow rapidly and triple in 4 to 5 years while its leverage ratio is going to decline and its size is going to grow by a) new projects adding 21%, b) $2 billion in share buy backs will increase per share metrics by roughly 5%, and c) volumes of natural gas and oil are increasing in various basins in the country as shale fracking continues to succeed in the Bakken, Permian, Marcellus, etc basins (North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Texas.....New York is too misguided by lying movie producers to produce its own natural gas....the Gasland movie producer is a proven liar, a proven fanatic with no concern for the truth....just watch Fracknation and see Gasland's false claims destroyed....and yes movie stars turned political leaders/environmental scientists are generally idiots).I am still working on the KMI research.  I am not yet sure how much the growth in shale production and increased volumes of flow through existing pipelines will matter.  I can follow the new pipeline projects as well as most anyone, but I still need to understand what sort of organic growth is possible simply from higher utilization of existing pipelines.  Can it add 2% a year to growth, can it do more.....I am not sure and no one writes about it.....but I already see 21% + 5% + some growth from higher volumes = 27% or higher growth coming.  As the leverage is lowered and the dividend is raised, then KMI will regain its former reputation as one of the best run, largest pipelines in the Americas.....and its peers trade at yields of 5% to 6% as MLP's while C-corp pipelines (KMI is a C-corp) generally yield less, more like 4% to 5%...so in 3 years when KMI is at $1.25 dividend on its way to $1.40 or $1.50, the stock is going to be $25 on its way to $28 or $30.  Add in the dividends of .80 cents, $1.00 and the $1.25 and you add another $3 in dividends, which suggests the stock value will be $25 +$3 = $28 up from today's $17 or $11 in gains.  In truth, I think these numbers are too conservative but I dont want to appear drunk so I have not emphasized that I think the stock ought to be $30, yielding 5% in 4 years which gets me $30 + $4.40+ in dividends or $34+ up from $17 today....which means I ought to double my money in 4 years....and the downside is not the same as if one is investing in a highly valued tech stock where you can get destroyed if you are wrong or if the stock market tanks.With this story, I intend to hang on through thick and thin, regardless of the stock market and or a recession, as I see the end story is compelling, obvious, easy and clear.  I have the chance to double my money rather quickly without leverage and without crazy risk and i will be paid ever increasing amounts of dividend income while I wait.  I am reading about the Trans Mountain Expansion Project in 4 Canadian papers and I still beleive it is highly likely to be built.  In fact, we ought to learn a LOT about KMI's probability of completing the pipeline this year, in the next 4 months, so this risk is not going to linger forever, we are going to see people start to believe in its completion rather than shy away from it.  This short term kicker is one reason why I think the stock has a good chance of ending 2018 around $20 or higher, provided the TMEP wins court approval and provided the Canadian Federation votes to enforce the project....both of which ought to happen.  That is why I like KMI",
"DIVIDEND: Was $.50 last year, is now $.80 this year, will be $1.00 next year, and $1.25 in 2020. That is the driver..",
Sounds like KMI is dead money until they reinstate prior dividends.   I am very long KMI and would like to put the money to work somewhere else for now.   Perhaps EPD is a better choice.   Any recommendations appreciated.,
Kmi will be hurt with raising interest rates because they have 10 B debt floating rate.,
"Great Article - i am not optimistic and been long on this stock  little choice  - Company has done little to promote investor's confidence - Really come on.I rather they do not hike dividends ..  With Trump in office and l absence  of regulatory hawks and price of oil stabalizing around $55-57 not the rosy picture of 65-86 ( Gold man Sachs ) this stock should be trading at higher multiples ... So disappointing -Anyone can offer analysis on how every dollar drop in oil price impact cash-flow/earning etc.? Also with market awash in OIL and Oil reserves filled to top, where is the growth will come if these projects slow down and hit road-blocks?  Why is the management not selling Assets to pay off debt and streamline their operation, lower operational costs..  All the comments here help .. I am now  considering AVG down but it's  really a big gamble with oil heading lower, interest rate going higher and their cash flow is not growing .    Just have lots of money tide up and want to get out  ..   Not sure where to go - DEAD MONEY",
"Agree with you Texasthumper, it is Silly to look at earnings with the pipeline companies. It is all about cash flow..",
These stocks do not trade on earnings. Too many numbers can be book and not cash. These stocks trade on cash. Epd trades at 15x cash flow per share. Kmi trades at 8-9 timescash flow. That is why analysts etc... say Kmi trades at a deep discount.,

Compare to peers:  KMI earned $27 million on revenues of $13 billion in the trailing 12 months.  Enterprise Products over the trailing 12 months had about twice the amount of revenues as KMI, $27 billion, but had earnings of $2.6 Billion, or almost 100 times as much as KMI!KMI has a dividend yield of 2.9% while EPD yields 6.5%.  EPD has a return on equity of 12%% and a return on assets of 5.2%.Why invest in KMI when just about every other pipeline company is doing a much better job for investors?Long EPD, among others.  No positions, KMI",
one question. US oil production is the highest in decades. More oil should mean more oit transportation. KMI should benefit. I expected a strong rebound in revenues. It is not there. Why?,
KMI is  SO CHEAP..........Because Kinder  is a liar.............. and who wants to hang around for 5 years to see a yield above 3 %.............I think the stock is worth less than $10.00 and would rather own EPD and do.........,
Kmi debt is 36b. Over last two years they have paid down 6b.Yes debt matters but after a certain point it really doesn’t. Kmi thinks 5x is the right place. Others believe 4.5x is the right place. They went from 5.6 x to 5.1.If they do nothing about debt and grow ebitda they will be at 4.5x in 2021.,
Christ the dividend was cut before most of the commentators knew they had downs.,
Kinder Morgan?   Are you kidding?,
"the number one reason the stock fell was the drop in the oil price?  For many years Richard Kinder boasted on every single conference call that his company was just a ""toll taker"" and had minimal exposure to commodity prices.Then they said the 75% dividend cut was done in order to rebuild the balance sheet.  Well, the debt is still over 5X cash flow, just like it was in 2013.  The KMI story is just NOT CREDIBLE.There are plenty of well run pipeline companies out there to invest in, with higher dividend yields, stronger balance sheets, and more honest management.   Why bother with Kinder Morgan?",
"Why are you slapping a 12x multiple on cash flow when ignoring debt?Let's say XYZ Inc has $1 per share in cash flow, 1m shares outstanding, but has $100m in debt. They got some sweet 0% interest debt that matures over the next 5 years. You going to value that at 12x cash flow too? Oops. Debt matters. Novice retail investors were all over KMI because they kept touting their growing cash flows and dividends. Notice retail investors got burnt because they ignored the debt. Slapping a multiple on a number by itself is useless. You need to look at the whole picture. KMI would be better served eliminating its dividend and allocating all that free cashflow to reducing debt to ebitda to a more reasonable level. Debt by itself can be used to magnify returns but KMI's debt to ebitda is insane.",
Boomer is long KMI & envisions price appreciation once dividend increases regain market attention.,
What is the estimated addition to KMI common stock float from the October 2018 mandatory conversion of the preferred stock?  Will there be a great dilution of stock ownership?,
The company did not have to cut the dividend. But then they did not have access to debt or equity markets to fund the growth projects:O cash flow of 4.5b and at 2.00 a share that eats up 4.4mm of the cashO they had to choose between growth or dividend. They chose growthO they then had to iPo Canada to put the funding on that companyO they had to sell some assets and jv other projects so they could reduce debt from 42b to 36b and defray some growth cap ex.As to floating interest rates yes they are risk but their floating rate is like 3.0 percent. They have 65-70 percent fixed and as they roll over the fixed rates they are doing it at lower rates.They have 600mm of free cash flow predicted in 2018 which they can use to buy back stock or pay down floating rate debt.The board approved 2b in buybacks which at this price it is like 120mm shares.I am very long Kmi and the market will eventually rationalize the price.,
"Wow, this is the longest thread on KMI article since the dividend cut without any complaining about being 'Kindered'.  It must be a good article!  Thanks!",
"Not to sound rude but the stock is cheap because the trust was broken. See, in this game, investors have no eyes on what is actually going on in a company other through management's report and books. Once management starts promising raises and cutting then....",
"besides the Transmountain noise, I think the fact that $10B+ in debt is floating has been an issue for the stock - 1% rise rates is $100m+ in incremental expense.does anyone know if the articulated dividend progression through 2020 includes cash flow from Trans?  or without Trans, those targets are unlikely?",

"Good article.  One small clarification on the debt.  I don't believe KMI has ever said they won't be increasing absolute debt levels.  The ""self funding"" is always in relation to equity markets.  And they plan to keep their debt/equity ratio at 5.1 with a goal of 5.0 longer term.As they grow the equity side by putting assets into service, they will also grow their debt correspondingly.  So the ratio can stay at 5.0-5.1 but their actual debt will most likely increase along with their build outs.Greg - long KMI.",
"On Beyond Investing, you indicate in your article that oil prices hurt cash flow and higher oil prices will increase cash flow.  As the company is primarily a natural gas transporter how do oil prices play a big role in all of this?  Can you provide more clarity on this? Thanks.",
"KMI is one of the few companies that will not benefit much, if at all, from the new US tax bill. In fact, the need to constrain their debt load to avoid the 30 percent of EBIT restriction on interest deductions makes expansion more difficult. I own KMI but the fact they are a loser in this new tax environment makes them relatively less interesting and explains some of their recent poor performance.",

How much is the stock worth if the pipeline in Canada does not get built?,
"I think KMI bought back $250 million of stock in December, not the $500 million you mention here.  I hope you are correct, but I am pretty sure it was $250 million.  Not a big deal though as I bet the company buys another $250 million of stock here in February and March if they have the cash available to do so....Your analysis and logic rings true for me, still I want to dig further into this $1 billion in taxes you claim they are saving.....to suggest that is accurate, are you suggesting that they are saving about 21% in taxes on $5 billion in otherwise taxable income?  I don't know how you reach such a number?  I will ask the mgmt for detailed clarification on that unless you care to explain further where you get the numbers?",

"They don't give details in the slides on the ALT so hard to say for sure. My GUESS is it's not a major issue at all.  Look through other Gene Therapy programs and ALT elevations several weeks into treatment happened in most programs.  The protocol has a course of steroids but I don't know the specifics perhaps the dose/duration were insufficient for the patient?  Since we are seeing a benefit in the CSF/Liver then its likely not leading to a major loss of expression (which would be a concern).  With such small numbers, it's still hard to draw firm conclusions.  I imagine Spleen size reduction is not as favorable and that is why they are not continuing to show it? Also, its listed as an AE, not SAE so I doubt the elevations are extreme.  Looking at the LFT chart for patient J perhaps they tapered too soon?",

"Looks like FNSR is underestimated. This is just the beginning of 3D sensor business. FNSR has been making VCSEL for decades, mostly for telecom customers. They shipped their 250 millionth VCSEL in 2016. They are still No.1 in the optical communication business and got 14,000 employees, which is 7 times of Lumentum. Apple is just one of their VCSEL customers. If it's really profitable and the 3D sensor business is GIGANTIC, we'll soon see FNSR make big movement. Sherman is just the first step. They got at least 120 million cash at hand, and they can have more if they want. The VCSEL manufacturing process is similar to other laser products and they own most of the patents.

I actually added some on that little dip.  Against my better judgment because this market is absolutely ridiculous but I have some dry powder because of the selling I’ve done of recent.

Strength in the stock is nothing short of impressive.,
"Hi Robert,I think you are totally right, and I think there will be tons of uses for 3DS.However, I think that the next very big moneymaker after 3DS for smartphones for LITE and others doing the laser part will be in self driving cars, because the VCSELs have to be higher power and resolution, as well as much higher reliability, so the will cost much more.People may say that self driving cars will not be ubiquitous until about 10y from now, and they may be right, but there are already safety features that look for obstacles ahead and brake automatically. This kind of feature is coming much sooner for mass production, and also has high demands on the 3DS camera.",
"Ok here is an example of 3D sensing beyond the Iphone or phones in general. Irobot (IRBT) in case anyone has noticed took a 30 percent dive today because their big product the roomba robotic vacuum has more competitors now. I was reading about IRBT in the boston business journal. The article there is written by one Kelly J O brien (the technology reporter) and by his picture looks to be as old as 25. He kind of takes the market to task for being ""short term thinkers"" and ""peppering"" the poor Irobot CEO with questions about operating margin (the poor baby.)  I was going to comment on the latest IRBT article here on SA about this tech reporter who obviously doesnt know how the stock market works when I brought up his last article about Irobot from April 2017 when the stock was flying high on increased roomba sales and I read this:""iRobot announced last month Roomba 900 owners will soon be able to activate their vacuums through Amazon Alexa, but a command as simple as ""Roomba, go vacuum the kitchen"" is still out of reach because neither the vacuum nor the Amazon device would be able to identify which room is the kitchen.""I am not a Lumentum 3D engineer but couldnt 3D sensing give the roomba the ability to tell which room is indeed the kitchen?? Couldnt the roomba go around your home doing  a 3D scan of the house so it knows which room is which by the scan?? My point is right now people are just thinking about 3D in the sense of facial recognition for phones. I see a much bigger picture. I dont want to get overly enthusiastic but 3D sensing could be as ubiquitous (big word so I can tell myself my college degree was worth it) as the internet (everywhere).",
Am I going to get my 50 or below entry point?? Sold my shares after listening to IIVI thinking LITE would guide down (like they did) and the stock would pull back. They guided down the market looked past that.,

Thanks for the article.  Please continue coverage of LITE with the exciting times ahead.,
"You also heard LITE say on the conf call, that they will need to increase capacity AND start manufacturing in CQ2 too meet the huge CQ3 demand.",
"I agree that the edge emitters would be less clear. There are certain functional (spectral) advantages in using EE's rather than VCSELs, but they are supposed to be more difficult to manufacture. That is why I was happy that LITE said that they will deliver a few million worth of them this quarter, CQ1, and more next. LITE will have an even bigger advantage in EE than VCSEL if more customers choose it, since the step into mass production of VCSELs seems steep enough for FNSR and IIVI.The Android situation is a beauty for LITE, sice FNSR will likely have to deliver all its initial capacity to AAPL as part of their deal, and for most Android guys, LITE will be a better, more proven choice than IIVI, since they have shown that they can ramp mass production.I would agree that a vertical model could seem more competitive in theory, but it also requires a steeper learning curve and LITE cooperation with the Taiwanese seem to really be based on mutual strengths.",
"Lumentum is clearly looking good to serve short term high growth 3D sensing demand for VCSELs. But Finisar is hot on its heels with a vertically integrated model which may ultimately prove more competitive. Also, its less clear for the emerging edge emitters business.",
Lite seems to be in a great position.  I also like himx who is lite's partner in supplying total 3DS solution to Android camp.  himx will have largest part of revenue with big piece going to lite and qualcomm.,
Well written..Lite does have a head start and seems good in execution ...however Apple has openly committed a big amount to fnsr and as fnsr Ramps up the Sherman facilities i assume a big chunk of 2H orders will go to them.,
These guys were really excited about the future.   They are swinging for the fences.  The analyst parade the following morning was impressive.  Even saw a couple double digit raises of price targets.,
"From what I understand, reading the AAPL watchers, analysts, (this also jives well with what was said on the FQ2 call) AAPL will have 3DS on ALL their models likely to be launched in September. This makes a lot of sense, since 3DS is not just face ID, but also a useful and fun  tool for kids with stuff like talking turds with synchronized facial expression with your own ones, and loads of other gaming and even useful applications.AAPL will need maybe 100M VCSELs just for the September launch (VCSELs now expected to sit on both the front and back of the phone). and another 100M for Q4. It it highly unlikely that FNSR (or IIVI) will be able to do that fast a ramp in their new Sherman (and UK) facilities.FNSR and IIVI obviously had ramping and yield issues 2017, and it is unlikely that AAPL will trust huge volumes to them in the Sept launch after only LITE could step up for iPhone X. FNSR has said that they can only muster a significant increase from today's volume (approx 5M/quarter which I base on their CEO saying 30 MUSD per quarter tops under good yield circumstances), since he also said the Sherman facility will only be ready for ramping in CQ3.In my mind AAPL put the big pre-order to FNSR to make sure they wouldn't drop out of 3DS. You want to have alternative sources of supply.IIVI seemed so muted on their conf call last week regarding 3DS, so I even guess that AAPL have dropped them.",
As  an  investor  it  would  be  helpful to  know  what  3 d  sensing  is and  how  it  relates  to  the  stock ?    Its  not  a  common phrase thats  on  cnbc,

"ALTThe bottom lie is that XOM stock performances has languished over the past 10 years. And unfortunately, the latest quarterly result suggests more of the same.",
"r cohn (above) - commented: ""XOM has done a poor job on replacing its reserves and has paid too much for acquisitions"" Exxon just reported their reserve replacement adds for year 2017. They added 2.7 Billion boe which is 183% reserve replacement. This is the best  they have done in years, and the proved reserve adds are for reserves that are economic at a much lower price than $60/bbl. Exxon's Resource Base for YE 2017 has added 9.8 billion boe through exploration discoveries and acquisitions at low prices, which represents the highest resource base add since 2010 when they paid a very high price for XTO. The mis-timed very high price for XTO was due to where the US was regarding proved natural gas reserves at that time (2009). The US had been planning on IMPORTING LNG to meet our depleted gas reserves before horizontal drilling in tight reservoirs increased US reserves, and changed how the entire natural gas industry in the US operated. Thus Exxon paid to much for XTO when they announced the acquisition in 2009. But with the 2010 acquisition of XTO came the same technology and experience needed for tight shale oil E&P (which is being used in the Permian). 2017 year end resource & proved reserves adds due to acquisitions & discoveries came from: Permian Basin, Deepwater Brazil Presalt Field, onshore Papua New Guinea purchase of InterOil, Mozambique, and world class major discoveries offshore Guyana. Exxon total resource base increased to 97 billion boe for year end 2017. These are large additions to the resource base, and there is plenty more to add in 2018 and on due to the size of these discoveries and acquisitions. Such as 3 additional offshore Guyana discoveries out of 6 discoveries to date with 3.2 Billion boe gross recoverable reserves to date, plus the addition of the latest Ranger discovery. Mozambique involves 25% interest in 85 TCF (Trillion). Exxon has dropped significantly since it hit $89 last week, and usually drops more after the dividend is paid (tomorrow), so it should be available to buy with a 4.05% dividend as of todays close. I see Exxon going up due to the exceptional 2017 proved reserve adds as well as the 9.8 billion boe resource adds. I am not sure if this information was presented during the 4Q 2017 earnings call. If it was not presented I see Exxon climbing soon. Regards.",

"Regarding, loosing experienced employees,  It's somewhat real but it's not quantifiable. However, these young bucks come out of college, (XOM only hires the top 2% of class) and take off running.  The experienced management is still in place both in the office and the field and they have plenty of mentors.  Everyone has known the old closed minded person who just won't consider anything but the way he has always done it.

Thanks for the article written in easy-to-understand terms. I had some XOM stock in 2016 and made some money on it. I am watching and hope to buy in the mid 70s. I like the 3.9% dividend and I agree this stock will be much higher in 1-2 years. I think the 10% rise predicted by the analysts may be a bit low.,
"Xom is still a bit too expensive. It’s normal PE for the past 20 years is 16.5. I’d argue that’s a bit rich going forward now that it no longer is perceived to have the best management in the business.  But even if you accept it should still carry a premium PE of 16.5 that would mean a price of $59 based on 2017 adjusted earnings or $74 based on 2018 projected adjusted earnings. It probably would make sense to say the company’s shares would be fully valued in the middle of that range, say $66.  I’d want it to trade a bit lower than that to buy. I’d want a risk premium.",

Have held XOM for a long time through many ups & downs. Those dividends just keep on coming to help pay for my needs in retirement. Staying long - buying some on these low levels.,
"The main driver of my optimism is their NG reserves. I think NG will be far and away the largest fuel source for power plants over the next 30+ years. I also think there is plenty of opportunity for XOM to acquire some of the larger NG producers (SWN, RRC, etc.) at a discount, further increasing reserves. I’ll wait for stock prices to level off and will add to my position. I think anything below $72 is a steal.",

I would think that makes the upgrade an easy decision. (Do you want an extra 90 miles range for $1500?) And the bonus, I get my car 6-9 months earlier.Don't forget that full tax credit is unlimited during Q2 and Q3, so sales would be limited only by production (which should be in the 5000/wk range around that).BTW, if Tesla is driving more people to upgrade to LR, that's not necessarily a bad thing from a profitability standpoint (and I am sure that bothers you as a short).

Given the companies financial woes might be difficult to get a refund at this point.  Hang on to your butts because this might be the biggest implosion since Lehman,
"I still remember your article in December saying GMs Volt outsold the model 3 at 9:1I think you might of missed the January figuresVolt 1,177Model 3 1,875",
"But one of the other ""Elron"" companies shot a Tesla into space, so I guess all is GREAT!Some analysts/fan boys seemed very impressed and will probably double their price target.",
"The biggest problem with Tesla is not what they do promise, or what they do tell you as a customer or shareholder. The biggest problem is everything they(Tesla) do know, but do not tell you.What signal do they send to their customers for the $36.000,- Model 3? You will just have to wait another year for your car. We are too busy launching a car in to space… Tesla is very busy generating extra publicity, but it’s time they focus on “generating”/producing cars.",
"I say tsla hits $310 tom.his explanation of maintaining gross margin target (25%) whilst here model 3 production roadmap is drastically reduced (cf the bullsh*t), shows they have no access to logic. Cash flow from operations total bogus: $500m but $497m came from inventory reduction; how is this possible if they are scaling up production?? Secondly $137m from share options being exercised. Is that cash from operations: its wages! converted into positive cash flow!! I just laugh. Musk magic wearing v thin now...Musk says 'I think' :-on gross margin-and Lidar - if his autonomous driving software cant see a huge fire truck and every other auto maker is using Lidar in order to see above fire truck, who do you think will be proved right....",
"Anton,Bravo!!!Earnings come out and you have your article out in a few hours. Such a hard worker, trying to pay off that judgement.",
"The Model 3 is simply an amazing car, nothing comes close to it in price point, even with 7500 bucks back from Uncle Sam I would not even consider another EV, I'd gladly wait another eight months if need be, nothing has the Model 3's style, performance, safety, passenger/cargo space or overall technology packed into it, and no one else has a fast charge network for long distance travel,,, Telsa's advantages far outweigh a 7500 dollar rebate and quite frankly, many people who put down a deposit never expected the discount would be available when the time came. Many people are also forgetting that Tesla's original target for production ramp was actually 2020, it wasn't until months after the deposits were taken that Tesla revealed it was going to push production ahead by two years, at the time nobody thought it was possible and yet here we are, mere months away from full production. Once again while bears continue to attack Tesla they fail to see the accomplishments Tesla have made, or acknowledge that production targets and cash burn will soon be old news when production targets are eventually met, by then we should see more doom and gloom articles with charts and graphs explaining why the Model Y will be the end of Tesla.",
"I put a deposit in on 12/26/16 and it took nearly 6 weeks for me to realize what was happening. So I applied for a refund and it only took 3 weeks,which surprised me. I shied away from the facts that were in front of me for over a year before I took the plunge.and it only took that 6 weeks to see the light. Too bad so many haven't as yet.",
The funny thing is the XIV longs would taunt the volatility buyers the same way TSLA longs keep taunting the shorts. That parallel is really ironic. The one thing in common is both the xiv longs and tsla longs have zero understanding of what kind of risk they are/were taking.,
The $35000 M3 was a scam to get lot of reservations and a successful equity raise. Scams like these end badly.,
If it's really a cult like you shorts say then the faithful will calmly accept the situation and wait for their turn at the alter... Meanwhile Elon can and should sell as many 50k Model 3s as he can for as long as possible... Every good cult leader knows that deep down inside the followers want to prove their faith by making the sacrifice... The poor members of the flock sacrifice by waiting patiently... The rich sacrifice by handing over that cash!,
EPS beat + revenue beat + $49k Model 3 outselling GM’s $36k Bolt = Stormy weather in Shortville...,
"How much longer will the SEC continue to let Tesla get away with this stuff?Few things are as material to Tesla's future as a going concern than the conversion of those Model 3 deposits into Model 3 sales.  And that is not going to happen in any meaningful degree if the $7,500 tax credit is not available on the Model 3 but is available on vehicles produced by a Tesla competitor.",
"Come on, Anton. Why would Tesla line up $36,000 buyers when they have more orders at $49,000 than they can fill (like mine). You can't both go after Tesla for not meeting schedules and also just being smart. Everyone (I know) assumes part of what goes on here is that Tesla had no incentive to fill M3 sales at the expense of Model S cars at higher price. Even aside from if people might accept or even prefer M3, they could have shifted resources from the MS and MX lines to get production up in M3, which the numbers show they didn't do.Tesla misses (the ridiculous and self inflicted) schedules, then chases the high dollar items. I'm sorry, the crisis is where exactly?PS. I am quite aware as a reservation holder than I need to pony up max dollar to get my delivery this year. And yea my delivery estimator makes that clear. So I pay extra, get the tax rebate to cover the difference. Score me. Gary not so much (apparently).",
"Usually I disagree with the TSLA shorters.  Make everything sound like doom and gloom, push the price down, make more money.But I pretty much have to agree with everything you have said.  I am a reservation holder, and basically can kiss the rebate goodbye.  I would not be surprised if I only managed the 25% rate of the rebate, or none at all.  I have been pushed to early 2019 now.  Which will probably be more like mid to late 2019 at the earliest.  And as they give preference to people ordering today, that order the LR version, over my two year old reservation, I will slip farther and farther back.  If they get enough new orders from people who are current owners, or want the LR or Dual motor so that it comes close to equaling their production rate, and then they keep inserting them in front of me, I may never get one.They should just cancel the SR version now.  And say that maybe in the future they may have it if they wind up with any extra production ability that is not taken up by LR and Dual motor versions. So, so bummed.  With the delay, and probably another delay after that, and the new cars from competitors coming out, and no rebate, I will more than likely cancel my reservation if I find something else I want from a competitor.",
"It feels like you are, once again, really reaching to find the hyper-negative in what was largely a lot of positive news today from Tesla. I don't believe a preponderance of people who are looking to buy the car are holding to to get a Tesla Model 3 for $27,500. Consumers know what these cars are worth, and they are willing to pay for them. If a Tesla Model 3 is a $27,500 car, then a Nissan Leaf should probably cost around $16,000 and a Chevy Bolt, what, $13K? As Tesla gets closer and closer to delivering on the Model 3, shorts are feeling the squeeze. Good luck to all tomorrow. Feels like we're looking at another leg up for Tesla longs.",
"Anton,How do you like the 20 M3's you ordered?http://bit.ly/2BKX6dS",
"Anton,Remember when you wrote an article saying that lack of 50% growth in q3 2017 would cause a run on the bank for institutional share holders whose stock portfolio was tied to the term growth but then that didn’t happen, like at all or in any way? Yeah. That will happen again here.",
People aren’t stupid and I would wager lessThen half of the 455 remain as of today.The further delay of the base Model willHalf it again.Lousy service and a lousy product withMore competition looming.Short Tesla,
"Anton,Nice try, but we are still here and still happy and long. But unlike the shorts, we aren't stuck with time limits or lose our axes.These petty little articles by shorts think that since their readers here do not fact check them that they will believe the slander here buy those who keep claiming he is a liar, fraud etc.I won't defend that, I will simply educate the peanut gallery that just like to see online controversy.You try, and fail, to give the impression that Elon Musk is just starting and has not produced anything yet, and what he has you claim is not represented truthfully.And this is not for the purpose of getting anyone to stay long with the rest of us.

They don't land reusable twin first stages simultaneously live on TV.They could save a lot on advertising if they just produced what Musk and Tesla has since 2008.

As I listened to the call today I could not stop thinking about my experiences working with the SEC and wondering how they can ignore the ongoing MATERIAL STATEMENTS from this Exec Team that continue to be incorrect.,
I was one of the first to reserve a m3 the higher end one. Resident of northern CALI not a previous owner. My reservation has been delayed four months on every earnings call. I have to call it quits can’t take the waiting any longer.,
Im from the Bay Area remember reading an SA piece awhile back on models in transit. After I read it I thought it was weird seeing car carriers full of model s and x going north on highway 101 towards the Tesla plant. Makes me wonder if the orders were canceled or are a certain amount always kept in transit to make it appear they were sold. Any thoughts on my observation,
Because the majority of comments are bearish Tesla I wouldn’t be surprised if today Tesla shares gain.That’s how ridiculous this stock is.,
wow - TSLA is in trouble. lollol lol.... I mean...hey I'm sorry but your buggy whip salesman all.,
Delay ?More like - NEVER !!!,
"1) I guess it is very hard to sell a hand-assembled car for $35K. 2) It is funny how some people still support Elon. He kind of has a product that they like and want. As such they have zero standards they are holding him to. Lies become business decisions, over promising and under delivering become slight exaggerations and minor delays. Financial holes became mouse nuts. I wonder if some surgeon with the same track record as Elon would be performing surgeries on those Tesla supporters or  their relatives. I bet they would whistle a completely different tune. A wrong leg was amputated, you had to wait 4 months for the surgery instead of 1 and died in the process, you got overcharged by a $100K because of some accounting error. Disgusting.",
"Agreed. Very deceptive to throw this out AFTER earnings call.Elon will brag about how few have cancelled. I'm am out, I fold. Waited with the faithful for 2 years and Elon betrayed that trust by ignoring people who've waited 2 years and let people who cough up more money cut in line ahead. The $35,000 car is a lie. It will never happen until the last person willing to spend $60,000 has stopped cutting in line. Pure money talks. Bribery. No level playing field. Line waiters deceived.",
shocked is no one that the base model has been pushed back to the end of 2018 if not early 2019. I have been calling this for awhile now because this is Tesla's classic bait and switch. Will it cause many to head for the doors? Not in the beginning because many will be hopefully that Tesla can fix its production problems and start selling the base model. I believe we will start seeing people switching to the Model s/x or another brand soon though. Also Tesla cares a lot about this reservation money because not only can they proclaim the number of people wanting a Tesla but now Tesla is using reservation money to offset CAPEX.,
Wow. no wonder the customer deposits dropped significantly this current report... imagine how fast the drop accelerates when they realize the credit is gone and the wait is longerrr. the velocity to the exit grows exponentially every second. like an s curve after the depositors find out they just got conned. this can drop to 250 soon.,
"Who would think that Tesla now hides its bad news behind even more bad news! But wait, the good news is that Musk claims they're going to produce 1 zillion Model Y's per year with 1/2 the capex that the Model 3 is requiring...uh yeah, that's the thing. Model Y anyone ??",
"well at least for the next four quarters, or so, they might come close to breaking even before they must compete with stronger competition. Hopefully by then Tesla will be able to provide more incentives to retain or gain new customers.",
Appreciate the disclosure about being short Tesla. As if that wasn’t obvious.   How much have you lost betting against Tesla so far?  I don’t want a Hyundai EV or a Kia or any other piece of junk.  I want a Tesla!   If I wanted some off brand I’d be driving a Nissan leaf!   I guarantee zero people ask for their refund.,
Can’t figure out why so many people put their money on that stock. It’s alwsys more and more BS.,
A good way to improve Model 3 ASPs!,
The big question is will Coverdrive and Montana Skeptic up their model 3 avg price estimates?  They have been using lowball price estimates in their theory that Tesla will go bankrupt.  Obviously that theory just went up in smoke.,
"The boards at InsideEVs are not happy:http://bit.ly/2BN8xlnMusk is slow rolling $35k M3.  The world will get their $55k M3's first, and then maybe Elon will get around to the $35k M3.  It is just business, of course.Nevertheless, the super-bad financials just released, the lack of capital raise or debt raise -- the payday loan that Tesla just took out -- all point to a liquidity crisis for Tesla, regardless of what the ratings agencies do.",
"Oh boy. The Musk fan club isnt going to like this one. And when reservations are cancelled, the credit rating is pulled. I agree this could be the loose thread that unwinds the Musk bullshit story.",
what? Tesla pulled a fast one? and the media did not care? and the cult just looked the other way? a shocking development.,
">the $400 million is not material to Tesla's overall financial situationI don't know about that, Tesla's financial situation might be worse than even many bears seem to think. Tesla ended the quarter with about $3,4B in cash, but should they come close to bancruptcy the $900M in deposits will be withdrawn very quickly. That leaves them with a more realistic figure of around $2.5B of usable cash. They pushed out $100s of millions of capex payments to Q1, and net loss will probably close in on a billion, so cash burn will be in the ballpark of $1.5-2B. That leaves them with a measly $.5-1B cash at the end of this quarter. They might not even make it to next earnings call before running into liquidity problems without a capital raise in the next few months, and people are still talking about Tesla being able to ramp the 3 without a cash injection, lol. They probably will get the raise done, but the question is how much they will be able to get, probably only enough to cover a single quarter of cash burn.",

"Boy Lee can not get out of its own way.  There is either something awful pending, maybe higher interest rates affecting a potential refinance, a really bad quarter about to be announced or a motivated seller, but the gap between its peers has never been more profound.",
"just to add another angle here - 4.1mm shares shorted, it's just ~ 8% of float but with limited daily volume it's ~ 28 days to cover (assuming you can be 100% of volume every day). couple positive quarters or any other positive catalyst and somebody can get hurt really bad..recall MNI was the most shorted stock in 2013 or so....",
"If an acquirer were to look at Lee, they would see that the cheapest aspect would be to satisfy the common shareholders, so the exercise of warrants could help pay down additional debt in the event of a takeover.  This would help offset the cash option which expires at the end of March.  While it does put a 10% cap on a potential takeover price, the influx of $25 million does help reduce debt by another 5%.  As such, I'm not sure how much in an impediment this would be to an acquirer.",
"In connection with the 2nd Lien Term Loan, we entered into a Warrant Agreement dated as of March 31, 2014 (the “Warrant Agreement”). Under the Warrant Agreement, certain affiliates or designees of the 2nd Lien Lenders received on March 31, 2014 their pro rata share of warrants to purchase, in cash, an initial aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment pursuant to anti-dilution provisions (the “Warrants”). The Warrants represent, when fully exercised, approximately 10.1% of shares of Common Stock outstanding at March 30, 2014 on a fully diluted basis. The exercise price of the Warrants is $4.19 per share.The Warrant Agreement contains a cash settlement provision in the event of a change of control prior to March 31, 2018 as well as other provisions requiring the Warrants to be measured at fair value and included in other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We remeasure the fair value of the liability each reporting period, with changes reported in other, net non-operating income (expense). The initial fair value of the Warrants was $16,930,000. See Note 9.In connection with the issuance of the Warrants, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of March 31, 2014 (the “Registration Rights Agreement”). The Registration Rights Agreement requires, among other matters, that we use our commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness for certain specified periods of a shelf registration statement related to the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of the Warrants.",

"Forgot to mention the FCC ruling as I think it could have a major impact going forward, although I don't know how much synergies there would be in Lee's markets as they are generally small.  How many other media outlets have the heft to consolidate, except on a one-off basis?  That ruling was well telegraphed and I have not scene much activity in the space, especially how it would affect Lee.  My instinct is that Michael Ferro and his management team isn't as interested in selling Tronc as it might be speculated.  I could be very wrong on this, but he fought real hard and has delivered stock gains in excess of Gannett's rumored high bid.   However, now that industry dynamics surrounding Gannett's buying spree have cooled down, and investor confidence seems to be returning to some of these companies, it feels like there could be some noise again.  The LA/San Diego deal appear much like the Las Vegas deal that New Media did a few years back.  Someone pays a lot for a prized asset for what appears to be their own reasons.  Still, Lee's valuation gap to it's peers remains notable, especially given their ebitda margins.  A potential refinance that would allow them to pay down debt outside of the current structure could be really beneficial, but I still can't see that happening while they have room to make an impact with their current structure in fiscal 2018 and call premiums drop dramatically in 2019.  It just has to be that good, or a financing window that has opened and is attractive.  Otherwise there's $30 million or so that will need to be amortized in excess call premiums.  Another thing to consider is that there are warrants that expire shortly and would increase the outstanding shares by more than 8 million, but in the event of a change in control, have a cash settlement clause.  I think those need to expire before an acquirer would step up...unless they are paying below the exercise price which i think is $4.18...that would be possible.  Another thing to think about is that transfer of debt to equity hasn't occurred.  This might be because declines in print and subscriptions were more aggressive than anyone might have modeled.  This affected the valuation metrics of the industry and more specifically this company.  But we just might have turned a corner as valuations changed in recent months which Lee has only seen a modestly.  Over the next weeks, we will see Lee's peers report their numbers, and it will be yet another sign post to the next few months for how the market views the company.  One thing that could be good is that these companies will report a 53-week year end, that Lee wasn't able to do because their year-end is in September.  This could be good for their year end results when released in December 2018....assuming they live up to their telegraphed comments that things should continue to get better for the balance of the year on the conference call.Now it's time for the Melting Ice Cube comment...",
"I was concerned that the quarter was not going well but got a lot stronger on the back half, so the results were better than I was fearing.  I feel it's important to note that last year's first half was terrible...especially the 2nd quarter, which is why I believe the share price collapsed.  The back half of last year was a marked improvement but a few things remain puzzling.  First of all, the industry has gotten a real valuation uptick over the past months (but might have reversed over the past week) and Lee was stuck at its slightly improved share price while it's peers hit new 52-week highs and achieved way higher valuations closer to 7x ebitda/ev as opposed to Lee's 4.4x.  Lee's numbers were pretty much as good as New Media's and they didn't have to make a lot of acquisitions to get there.  There's a lot of talk about what can go wrong here, so lets think about what can go right.  Although a different animal, NYT's numbers this week were pretty strong and maybe viewed as a harbinger for the rest of the industry.  Refinancing their debt has to be a great deal, or why not wait till next year?  With what they can pay down between Pulitzer and current debt, is all they need over the next 12 months.  Further, I don't know what chess pieces have moved around with Tronc's sale of LA/San Diego Times, but at the multiple it was sold 8.1x, Lee's value would be worth more than $9 and at current Tronc's valuation, almost $5.50.  Unless I read the trust indenture wrong, a buyout of Lee would only command a 1% premium to be paid to bondholders.  I have to believe that they have attractive enough assets and industry leading margins, and another round of consolidation could be around the corner.   Now that the bitter taste of the  GCI/TRNC non-deal is dissipated into their share prices, perhaps these companies would look to re-engage more growth and get hold of that ebitda, which allows them better levers to reduce interest costs and create synergies from corporate low-hanging fruit.  One thing that irks me is the increase in outstanding shares that are issued to management and it's Chairman's apparent $2 million salary. I'd like them to really consider being more shareholder accommodating and address this issue in and around a refinance.",
"The most restrictive covenant is the 3.25x leverage ratio comprised of Adjusted EBITDA/ (Debt – Cash). So the company already has to bear the most covenants. I reckon the notes will be refinanced for a lower rate as the company is in much better shape than in 2014 when they refinance. I agree that the pension liability is also there, and adds some additional risk. However, I think recession risk for the company is overstated. It is not as if the industry isn’t already in a huge decline and the company has managed to do a very good job for the last 5 years. Online revenue might take a hit when the recession comes, but that is something we would have to see. I do not see cashflows evaporating on a short term basis. It all revolves around how quickly the company can get the leverage ratio down to 3.25x. I expect this to be early 2019. On the premia, I think LEE will not have to pay a lot of premia to call its debt. There is 33mn left on the 1st lien loan. Which will be probably paid off in Q4 at this rate. Any additional cash flow will mostly run through Pulitzer which makes calling the 2nd lien loan premium free. Coming March 31, 2019 the 2nd lien loan won’t have a call premium anymore. I think the company will either refinance before or just after this date.",
"Nice article, but not much new here.  You are also overlooking recession risk.  If a recession hit, ad revenue would decline rapidly and mess up all of the nice cashflow forecasts you have.Probably you are right - there is just enough gas in the tank to pay off the debt and equity might get something, although you have overlooked the pension liabilities, which, while smaller than the formal debt are still $200mn, and accruing interest.  They have $150mn in the pension trusts, which is good, but 50% of that is in equity, a bear market could actually see the value of the pension assets decline.The big risk here is that they violate one or more of the debt covenants before they can get this stuff paid down.  If they can continue to operate as they have the past few years, they probably can get out in front of the liabiliites, as debt reduction of $65mn a year or so (they have to pay premia to prepay for a few years yet) reduces interest expense by about $6mn a year which likely offsets the decline in operating cash.   It seems probable that they will pay off the first lien this year and make a nice dent in the 2nd lien.  You can even see them paying off the 2nd lien in 2019, but it will be years before they can pay off the notes.  Now they have until 2022, and so you could see them paying 180-200mn and then refinancing the rest (or just doing a refi after the liens are paid).  Again, the issue is, what happens if a recession hits and they fail to maintain the cashflow they need.I have to admit I haven't take the tieim yet to read the indentures, so not entirely sure what all of the covenants & ratios are, but if it is a cashflow, ebitda etc. multiple, then the operating risks are significant, as the K and the Qs note: namely, the note holders have the right to take some of the crown jewel assets.  If someone has some color on those, it would be helpful.Something tells me that you are right - that the odds are better than 50:50 that they sqeak by and the equity has lots of upside if they do.  The problem is, if they hit a rough patch, there is a very non-zero chance (probably 1 in 3 or roughly my estimate on the odds of a recession between now an 2020) that you have a total loss.  Probably there are better risk / reward options out there.",
"The smart folks over at Bloomberg Gadfly are speculating that the announced sale this week of the California newspapers by the company formerly known as Tribune (sorry but I can't bring myself to use the new name) means that the Gannett takeover of Tribune, which failed in 2015 (or was it '16?), may now happen. This is, on its face, unrelated to Lee Enterprises but there's actually a connection because one of the rationales for being long Lee is industry consolidation. If Gannett does buy Tribune it's a safe bet they won't be bidding for Lee any time soon. Not that there aren't other possible buyers, of course.https://bloom.bg/2GYtR6G",
"Thanks for the article, there is some solid information. I don't agree on your observation about the acquisition. I posted this response before right here: https://seekingalpha.c..., but I thought it was worth repeating in this thread since the other article is behind the paywall. I had some time to digest the numbers, the acquisition seems to add $14 million of which $900.000 - $1.000.000 in digital revenue. Townnews was strong with 12.7% growth, digital retail grew 5.7% and national digital saw 15%+ growth. Total digital advertising just grew 2.8% which means digital classified revenue must have been very very bad. I did not like same property growth for Lee especially subscription revenue was lower than expected at -3.2%. Advertising revenues were below my expectations as well with a 11.7% decline. Especially if 28% of this revenue is digital and grew 5.7%. This means nondigital revenue declined in excess of 15%From the 8K it seems Lee is distributing more of its MNI assets towards Pulitzer which helps in paying down the 2nd lien loan. Pulitzer results were better than i expected, but I have to be honest and say Lee legacy results ex-acquisition came in much lower than expected. They will pay of 5.6 million of the 2nd lien loan in Q1 lower than the 6.5-7 i thought they would. I guess there is approximately 4 million of Pulitzer real estate under contract which will help to pay off the loan in the upcoming quarters. One last positive is that the Edison project looks to pay off with 20% revenue growth of which 33% is digital.",
"I mentioned this before... thought I’d repeat myself here...LEE's current ratio is a bit lean but the cash ratio is abysmal. It might be better for them to fill their coffers to improve liquidity and show the world they can easily cover their debt obligations before they do any more acquisitions.Print will not die, but it must be readjusted. Digital is moving along but more capex there may be for the best. Cap x was about .17 a share (10m) last time I bothered to check.The increase in revenue decline is worrisome but share count has been increasing and so has ESP. Non-convertible debt is down 40% in the last 5 years and retained earnings is increasing, not to mention shareholder equity has increased 46% over the last 5 years. Over all the company is downsizing and surviving. I hope they continue to do so... it may be a good investment someday.",
"This is a great write-up.  Thanks for all of your research.I do take exception to  your statement ""I don’t think that those two acquisitions were bad by any means....."".  I think the Pulitzer deal was horrendous (even if they had used equity).  Mary Junck rushed into that.  And to compound there error, they continued to pay a dividend for a few years after that.But she (and the rest of the team) have have done yeoman's work of righting the ship.  Weather there will be any value left for the equity holders is uncertain.  (fyi, I have been long LEE and FP.TO {Winnipeg Free Press}. TI drastically underestimated the continued beating Print advertising has had....hence, I am at a substantial loss on FP and a smaller one on LEE. I think the 10 year trajectory is towards a 90% reduction in Print newspapers.  If they cannot work with Google/FB to generate their fair share of revenue for the content they are creating, it will be difficult for them to generate meaningful cash flows (regardless of debt).",

"Jeori,Did you see that 4.6x coverage, and increase of cash/share from .50 in q3 to .65 in q4 for TGP??!! They could double the divi and still maintain a coverage of 2.3x !!

"What about deleveraging? Having a decent amount of financial flexibility is key in this business. With the recent TK raise they shown they like to take a more conservative approach. A 'ASAP' Massive raise that drains maximum cashflow from TGP does not seem to align with their previous actions?The only reasons I can see them raise big ""soon"", is if they want to deleverage through issuing new equity for TGP at 25$+ prices and try to deleverage a bit that way (would make more sense from a TK GP perspective as they then take more of the economic profit due to the IDRs)MY guess would be H1 2019, with guidance about the raise in late 2018 when most ships are operational and delivery risks are out of the way.

"Dear all, I have to share a piece of information and ask for help. About two weeks ago, I was talking to an acquaintance at the gym and singing the praise of TK after I read JM postings.

I would not touch it'I asked what he was looking at and all he said ""for me to know and you to find out"", smiled and left.Since then the TK has been under pressure and such well educated in the stock as Joeri and JM have had an opposite view.My question to anyone knowing the answer and willing or able to share it is:How does one know the money is flowing it out? What is it that he was looking at? I did not want to nosy and rush to see what was on the screen.Does it always portends a lowering of price? or rather is this an accurate way to time ones purchases.

"Joeri,I respect your articles and believe you do a thorough analysis.  I am long TK from a long time ago when JM recommended it.Having said that, it is a frustrating holding.  The TGP dividend increase never happens, and always gets pushed to the future.  TK share price goes to $10.90 on 1/23/2017, and management does a secondary, pushing the price down to $7.50.  It seems both TK and TGP managements do not care about share prices.  I don't even understand the logic for the TK secondary, if the cash flow improvements you cited happened in Q4.  All in all, very frustrating.Thanks.",
"Joeri, I think you're spot on regarding the likelihood that TK returns the two older LNG carriers to TGP in April.And to be honest, they should also think about dropping down the FPSO's to TOO. Probably not as easy from a governance standpoint because you would need Brookfield's okay, but in terms of making the TK story going forward very easy to understand, to me if they were simply a holding company with investments (and IDRs, where applicable) in the three daughter entities, it makes modeling the various cash flows and potential upsides very easy.",

"Hi Joeri,good additional color on TK but the stock hasn't suffered because of Teekay's cash flow issues as of late.The stock has been under pressure because of perceived negative implications of the recent offering:1) Timing of a potential TGP distribution increase 2) 2020 debt rollover issuesObviously, TK is not assuming a major TGP distribution increase until the 2020 bond is refinanced as otherwise this just wouldn't be an issue. At least the market does not see the bond being at risk given its trading price. That said, management has hinted to the offering on the last conference call:""And I think when we are looking at the refinancing and debt, I think we would like to continue to delever the balance sheet as we approach 2020. So we are taking a multifaceted approach here in terms of both increasing free cash flow as well as chipping away at that maturity before 2020. I think, especially with the strong macro environment I think we should be in a good position to look at various alternatives to refinancing that.""",
"The stock may go further down due to the global sell-off might continue a bit more before going up again - fundamentally and technically it seems. But there seems to be okay support around 7,5 for TK I added a lot at 7,53.. it’s a great risk/reward now",

Will start nibbling around $6/share for technical reasons (maybe sooner on some massive piece of good news) and really load up if it gets to $5, which it won't be at for very long. Hopefully, by then, management will get out of its own way and J. Mintzmyer's thesis will begin to take hold.",
Hi joeriGood write up! I agree TK is low at present. I think the reason is partly one of not understanding what you’re buying. If I may - I think it would be a fine idea to show a SOTP of the balance sheet. In addition to the figures you have shown above. I feel it would be quite complimentary.Anyway-good work as ever!Tw,
"Thanks again Joeri. Good report here and it also saves me some work as I'm planning a quick update as well to come public before earnings. I will focus more on the raise itself, how we have $225-$250M of institutional money saying TK is clearly worth well ABOVE $9.75-$11.70, as well as showing how the higher share count impacts the forward valuation targets.Hint: It doesn't take away much upside at all, since the majority of cash will be used for debt reduction and interest costs will drop.I've been buying a LOT of $TK lately, albeit a tad too early it seems, as I believe TK in the $7-$8 range today is a BETTER buy than it was last summer at $5-$6.",
Will the end of the charter ins negatively impact TGP?,
"Hi JoeriThanks you for the article, I usually read you and always learn something! . I am long TK since the Morgan Stanley morning; every month the company is stronger and better!I am relatively new in the maritime sector (started purchasing this companies 9 months ago), a 80% downturn from all time highs and Cobas Asset management is the cause why I got interested in this sector. I have a question I hope you can answer. There are a lot of companies trading at 0,50x, book value that keep paying dividends even if their stock is so cheap. I simply dont understand how so many maritime companies are paying dividends yielding a 3-5% meanwhile the stock trades at less than book value for years. How is this possible? Because of a base of shareholders dividend-addicted? Is just the culture of the sector? They dont have the ability of putting aside the status quo?I undestand this is a very cyclical and now punished sector; that´s why I am here. But there are asset alocations that I dont understand in this sector, if TK needs money to strengthen their balance, why not firstly cut 100% OF THE DIVIDEND? A normal Corp would do that as first step. maybe I am new here and I have other perspectiveI hope you could answer me, I would be very gratefulThanks,",

"My back of the napkin calculation is that their land holding / real estate investment division, has about $10 billion dollars in assets (conservatively) just in the Chilean central region that are not wine related / used for wine production. The company has been under reporting the value of that land vs. market value of similar real estate. If you take that in to account, in over say the next 5-10 years, this company is really more like a real estate investment trust, than a wine producer. I would not be surprised to see them do some sort of spin-off of the real estate development division.",
"Glad to see another SA contributor interested in VCO. To be clear, the price is running up because they are selling off Santiago, Chile land at huge capital gains - and they have plenty more in reserve. In fact, they've set up a real estate development arm to monetize these gains. Other Chilean land plays listed in Santiago are up 100% or more over the past two years... VCO is highly undervalued on a P/B basis when you adjust their land to fair value rather than stated book - don't get too hung up on operating earnings, though obviously they are a nice add-on to the real estate story.Disc: own a lot of VCO, also drank some Casillero del Diablo this week.",

It is way overstated because it is not taking into account the milestone payments coming in from Novartis and the fact that Novartis is paying for half of all Ph2 trial expenses.  Conatus might not ever have to raise money, or, if they do it will be in mid-to late 2019.  Further, it is a non-issue because at that time the stock will be $30+ so the number of new shares will be very low.  Likely 3 million, MAX.Your $7 year end stock price target makes no sense at all.  By July 1, 2018, CNAT will be either $25 or $2.  It all depends on the first Ph2 results in April/May/June.",

Does anyone know how to turn off notifications of new comments for a specific article?,
real and pretend toreadors as an active commentator I have noticed that many authors and commentators are like toreadors dressing for meeting with the bull in the arena.  What have i have noticed is that while all they look good standing outside the arena many seem to break out in a cold sweat when the bull appears.  And then when their turn comes up to actually go in and meet their fate a bout of nauseau overtakes them and then retreat to the dressing room as the real fear of being gored is overwhelming.  comments welcome,

"That's a good article too. I have a different opinion than both of you but appreciate both perspectives. I can poke holes in your article just as you could probably poke holes in any one of mine - and as you've done with this one. Interestingly, it was this article's original analysis that you used in your article and that, in and of itself, is why I think this is a good article. It shows me the analyst is trying to investigate, dissect, and interpret data. Whether its right or wrong, I don't know and don't care. The concept, however, is intriguing. Even if O is reporting correctly and is not declining its SS rents, 1% growth? That doesn't sound too great but at least its growth, right. My bigger question is how can they be recapturing rents at 102% to 106% yet same-store rents are only growing at 1%? Seems to be that having a well-laddered lease schedule in this case is not helpful - probably because escalators are around 1%. I'd like to see a big year in which leases come up for renewal, then maybe those recaptured rates of 100%+ will trickle through to same store growth. In the meantime, looks like O is going to have to keep on raising capital and buying more properties. That's OK, though. The question is, how much bigger can it get or how much longer will that model work? I'm working on that.",

"Just a comment here on unrealized losses:  They are real.  Here is one scenario:Pen invests $100,00 with his broker, Big Talker - or BT for short.  BT claims that REITs are the best way to go with his portfolio and he can earn $4,500 a year based on a yield of 4.5%.  That sounds reasonable to me.  A year from now Pen meets with his broker (no pun intended) to review his account.  Pen does have $4,500 in dividends.  In fact, one of the dividends was raised - so Pen is actually up $4,650 in dividends.  Big Talker (BT) says things are going great and the portfolio is doing fine.  Pen looks at the year-end statement but notices the account value is down to $85,000 because the stocks promoted by Big Talker have tanked 20% in value.  While he is down 15% in one year, Pen and BT give each other high 5's for having a great year in the REIT market, because he is not down any money.",

"The duration is assumed 10 year, 30yr or perpetuity(pretty standard) though based on the duration result would have moderate variance(this can be calculates specific to period). Short term bonds are moderately safe but have no yield! I used some crazy quant math my thoery is the higher the interest rates the less you need to be discounted on a reit  due to low probability of rates increasing more will lower likely. This would be very innacurate if rates went up in an accelerated pace but I'm not one to believe we will see inflation per my comment above. you could run my calculations against historic data and match the period to one where you think inflation will be going and get the exact percents of correlated drops, I  think my numbers are close . Regardless it's still 6-16% yield vs 3% yield of bonds with the probability more likely you lose money on bonds if a sharp move occurs(personal opinion based on my interest rate theory)",
"regarding this statement I can certainly clarify what part is confusing?1.Here's an exaggeration but should do a fair job as a sample: if bonds yield 3% and the interest rate or inflation increase by 3% your 10000$ bond is likely worth 5000$ because investors now expect to receive 6% on their bond so you need to sell it for half off, ifwhat is the duration of the bond you referencing?2. Reits on the other hand if they yield 6% they may need to only go to 7-8% a 15 to 25 percent drop and if your stuck holding it then you will be making 6 % with 0-6% growth up to 12% vs bonds how did you come up with this?",

regarding this statementO appears unreasonably cheap compared to bondsbased on what metric?,
"O appears unreasonably cheap compared to bonds(imagine losses in bonds if rates skyrocket), stocks(may be more impacted by rates than people believe due to loans usage for growth and buybacks) and other reits( many pay less dividends and have worse holdings imo), inflation rates likely won't skyrocket due to raising rates because the reversal of qe will remove money from the money supply which counters some inflation with deflation. Volume of o is very high if you go back to all of its charts and look for 5m shares a day traded. To add institutions appeared to net inflows last two quarters which leads me to believe they are trying to buy the reit dip. I would expect a larger price drop from the massive volume we saw if people were going short but my analysis could be wrong- disclaimer I am long o and intent to enter future positions",
regarding this statementI think its a bit early to predict a short squeeze. But its likely to be coming.what empirical evidence do you have of this?,
"It takes talent to pick one of the reits that reverses its down trend within days of when you say its 40% overvalued! Now you are short a solid reit that has a higher than index divididend, likely lower than index risk at a 52 week low and betting against the large institutional investors who had what appears net inflows in Sept and dec; market -.88 o up. 75%, vnq up .32%. if the reit sector gets capital inflows due to the cheap valuations you will really start hurting all it takes is one instition to buy this dip and short investors may be squeezed, I really hope no-o-one copied your short position - disclaimer long o and will intend to enter positions in the future",

Those are the extremes. I am a big fan of the book Dividends Still Don't Lie by Kelley Wright. He espouses buying stocks near their historic high dividend yields and selling near the low yield, of course with requisite due diligence to other fundamental factors.

"The comments in this article are the problem with SA.Mr Axler wrote an article saying to be worried about O.  Based on the fact that the stock has fallen almost 20% in the last 6-8 weeks, his warning should at least be heard.But instead, he is being personally assaulted by those too emotionally attached to the stock to think rationally.  The totality of the comments are an effort to bully him off the ""stage"".  The flaw in SA is that 98% of the people commenting here own the stock, so we are just hearing one side of the story in the comments (I happen to be among the 2% who doesn't because I had O on a watch list).An article like this, instead of bringing out the emotional wrath of so many, should be encouraging everyone interested in O to go back to their valuation models.  A lot has happened in the world the last few months that could impact O;  are those changes accurately reflected in your valuation?  The movie theater industry has reported some disappointing results, Amazon/BRK/JPM are getting into the health care business (although we still don't know exactly how), etc.  Maybe you still come out with a $60 value and decide $48 is an opportunity to back up the truck, or maybe you come to a different perspective.  ""Brad Thomas says...."" is not a rational argument;  nothing against Mr Thomas, he gets a lot of calls right, but he isn't perfect and shouldn't be treated as the holy gospel.I don't know how SA fixes this problem, but there has to be a way to bring balanced perspectives to each stock analysis.",

Seems odd to me since the last book my wife ordered from Amazon wound up in Illinois and we just happen to live in Tennessee.  It is a good hype to follow around though as an investor and buy the supposed failing companies on the drop. I think O was a little rich as were many companies were and have been waiting for a drop like this to buy in.  They won't be able to pay a 7 or 8 percent dividend unless the properties they buy get much cheaper since most quality NNN deals they own are presently selling for sub 7 caps.",

"Article is based on rather primitive manipulation of company metrics to create an impression of declining business. For example it states that the number of vacancies increased by 91 just last year while in fact it was approximately flat. This number is fabricated by excluding new leases from newly acquired properties while including properties which did not get new leases and were (or are in the process) of disposing. Naturally properties destined for sale are not getting new leases but it does not change anything as this is not one time event but year after year business as usual. Instead author suggests that disposing of underperforming properties is somehow wrong and even deceitful. Nonsense, of course. Some non-zero vacancy rate is normal as exiting some portions of the business and adding other. All businesses work this way, not only REITS. This is just an example, there are many more silly accusations like that based on ""creative analysis"" in the article above. Not worth an ink.

In addition, Ultimate’s audit chairman served in the same role at another company that went bankrupt when executives were convicted of fraud.Spruce Point rated Ultimate Software stock a Strong Sell and Axler predicted 20–45% downside once the market fully appreciates the company’s shortcomings.Since his bearish call 14 months ago, the stock is up over 25%.

"Ok, the dumb newbie here. I only have 3K in O and bought a month ago and am down. A few things I dont understand. I thought O bought a lot of real-estate the last year or so. Maybe they are not all rented yet??? O is down 25% already from the 52 week high, and to go down 35-40% ??  It seem the value of the real-estate would be worth more than the total price of all the shares?  Also, there is hardly a REIT that has not suffered much the same way O has, even WPC. It sure has a long track record and that is more than I can say for some out there , especially the Amreican Realty Capital bunch. I sold GNL for O, and wish I'd have waited a few weeks . Although a new investor , I see this stuff all the time , and the little experience I have in reading S.A , I have seen several times Authors bad mouthing and promoting a stock.

When people buy an index fund (like VNQ) the fund buys the index components.  When people sell an index fund, the fund sells the index components.

"For a general observation, it seems to me that the disclaimer and the stock positon long/short of the author should be at the front of the article.  This is similar to the risks of an ipo in an S-1 for a stock offering.  IMO many readers want confirmation of their beliefs in the associated article to instill confidence in our position on the stock.   So an article for a short is not the usual method of most investors to create wealth and therefore we object to the rational the author uses for his/her position.  I quite frankly am dubious of most authors who own/short a stock and then write with great confidence of why it is the way to prosperity.   Both may have an ax to grind and both could benefit by convincing others to follow their footsteps into the stock.  I know that is the game on SA, but I am weary.  Just a thought.",

I’m under the assumption that a lot of the recent declines in O are related to interest rate sensitivity.  I think it’s still a great buy and hold stock. The yield is up to 5.25% which is pretty good.I started a small position inside my Roth.  Hopefully it will pay off down the road.,
regarding 0 performance the 0/VNQ pair has seen O be a mutliyear outperformer but it has underperformed since february 2016.. the pair has put in multiple bottoms going back to december 2016.. we are nearing those bottoms ..assuming no change in index would target mid 40's for acquistion with a trailing stop below 43.15..comments welcome,

"Ben Axler -  Do you have an response about the Rip Off report below with your name and company on it.  I also saw somewhere that your company employs social media fear to bolster your short positions.   Do you have a response to the below article? .    http://bit.ly/2BKssRF""Spruce Point Capital Watch Out! New York New YorkRecently I worked as an analyst doing consulting work for a small hedge fund in NYC called Spruce Point Capital Management. Initially I was very excited to work with the principal, Ben Axler, who impressed me with his interviews on Hedgeye TV. There, I got the image of a man who was highly professional, polished, and an expert in his field. When he took me on to help with a project, I was genuinely thrilled. I thought, not only will I be working with one of the most up-and-coming hedge fund managers, I’ll also be working with an activist short-seller who fights to expose the unstable or even corrupt companies that are throwing the market off balance.Yet from the first few weeks working on the project, I witnessed some troubling behavior in the company. The first warning sign came when I tried to find a reliable lab that could analyze the content of a target company’s product composition. I approached Axler with my suggestions, but he insisted that we use one particular lab, even though he couldn’t explain its advantage. When I asked questions about it, I was met with evasive answers and annoyance.From phone conversations I overheard, it appeared as if he had a deal with this lab – there was clearly nothing independent about the testing they conducted. In addition to the shady situation with a lab, there were other instances where I got the feeling that Spruce Point Capital was manipulating data in the reports for its own benefit. The bottom line was always about justifying a short position, the facts took a backseat unless they were serving the Spruce Point narrative of a failed company. If information emerged that didn’t fit neatly into the one-sided story, I was told to disregard it.In short, I would recommend analysts who are accustomed to working with rigorously ethical companies (as I was until now) to stay away! You are not only contributing to an illegitimate business – you are risking your own reputation by associating with this hedge fund. Don’t believe the hype about these trendy new funds. As for investors, all I can say is, the information you read about in Spruce Point Capital’s reports is so carefully filtered that it is practically meaningless. This is the first time and last time I work for this sketchy business masquerading as a financial firm."" So it comes down to who one believes. I have also sent a copy of this report to Realty Income hoping for a response...”Disclosure: I am long O.",

Closed under $49 with heavy volume. The market has spoken. Bad times ahead for O.,
"One research article does not confirm much at this point. Facts must be analyzed first. Speculation at this point. Good for option investors, little else. O is a long term investment per se. Dividend is intact. A lot would have had to change in the past quarter to support this thesis. A lot! Demographics for one. If O were to tank, the whole REIT sector would follow. Financials for REITs are solid. Therewill likely be short term impact if FED goes too fast with rate increases. Once cost of capital can be predicted REITs would settle in for the long haul. That is a summary of what most analysts predict.",
"And to use the authors logic, since he worked at Credit Suisse, which illegally provided unregistered  cross border investment services for clients and paid $196 million in fines to the SEC and approximately 2.4 billion in fines for helping US citizens evade taxes, we shouldn't trust him either.

"Sorry, but you cannot simply deduct the vacancy level from the SS rent growth.You can only deduct the INCREASE in the vacancy rate from that growth rate.Thus, if the company says SS Rent growth is +1.5% and you see that vacancy increased by 50bps YoY, the adjusted SS Rent growth would be 1.0%.Clealrly, in any case, accounting for the ""rent"" of a vacant property as being ""0"" in a SS calculation is itself misleading, since the achievable rent of the vacant property is not zero.Finally, same property revenues CANNOT be declining. Virtually all of their properties have annual rent INCREASES. Only a few percent of the company's leases expire in a given year.Most of them are re-leased, a few are sold, and some remain vacant for a time.",

"Furthermore, how are we supposed to trust the author and Spruce, being investment people and statisticians and not business owners nor owners of movie theaters or grocery chains as knowing what they are talking about when they cast aspersions on the health of either industry?",
"3. The author mentions that people should be concerned about the background of the management and audit committees of O. They mention the investment banker background and being trained in financial engineering, and then mentioning that they could use this training during the course of their service at O. Yet they provide no evidence, just could ofs/conjecture.Furthermore, they heap disdain on the competency of the audit committee because of their backgrounds. Yet two of those committee members were senior members of a top accounting firm and a top bank. This background gets shaded/dirtied by their mention of KPMG and Wells Fargo's improprieties, even though they mention after that that no evidence existed that these guys had done anything illegal/wrong while at said firms.They also question the ability of another board member (Katherine R. Allen) because she had no real estate experience. Most curiously, if one examines her c.v. posted on her faculty page at USC one sees that this is not the case. http://bit.ly/2BNoc3SIn fact she has experience in real estate from being involved in several companies besides O:Founder/CEO-American Pacific Investments-Involved in real estate brokerage and consulting (1982-1988)Principal-John Allen Company LLC-Involved in commercial real estate development and investment(1981-present)Principal of Valley Capital Partners-Involved in commercial real estate development and investment(2007-present)Also, the ""Golf pro"" has a BS in Economics from Ohio State and a law degree from Chicago Kent College of Law.

The timing of this release was devious as well. Most REITS have weak technicals right now and O was rebounding early. The overhanging supply was already an issue but the timing took full advantage of this and compounded that in the short term. The blessing here is that DRIP investors will be rewarded now and benefit from that over time.,
"Spruce Point is attempting to paint a picture similar to what happened to American Realty Capital Properties (ARCP) with their accounting fraud by sowing the seeds of potential fraud in the way O reports certain company metrics, and by painting their management and audit committee as nothing more than amateurs or having been linked to previous company shenanigans.  The history of Realty Income should dispel these unfounded attacks, and I expect management will have something to say about this hit job.  When Spruce Point has some hard evidence of improprieties, we'll pay more attention.  In the meantime, as with most rumors, investors should not let such things counteract their fundamental views of O.  It has lost 1/3 of its value since July 2016, and next week we will hear from them on the ER and see for ourselves whether another 30-45% downside is in the cards.",

If it had not sold 91 vacant properties since the beginning of 2016, the occupancy metric might be as low as 96.6%.""  This is laughable.

"2. Making mountains out of molehills-When comparing occupancy rates, Spruce compares O to 4 other companies and does not mention industry wide variation in occupancy rate. Is a 2.5% difference in occupancy as reported by Spruce that big a deal/significant(e.g. 96.6% vs. 99.1 for the other 4 companies)? Also, does that number reflect a one time event such as a major renter going bankrupt and not renewing the lease? And if that is true, then does O have a replacement for said renter?It is also not clear whether Spruce adjusted the numbers to reflect the size/total capitalization/worth of the companies that they compare to O. So is the 0.25% ownership by O insiders really that low?Also, the author mentions that O has the most number of leases up for renewal in 2 years out of the 4 other Triple net leasing companies, as if it were a negative. Yet, one could look at it as a positive in that higher leases could be renegotiated.  O one could envision new clients who will rent and be more stable than other clients.",

Wait for the next big uptick to short.I've been looking at a trade buying O around these levels, waiting for such a bounce, and then selling covered calls as an exit strategy.  But I've gotten burned so many times trying to catch falling knives, I think I'll wait till it finds solid resistance.",

The author criticizes O for the way they calculate SSR, Then they use ""Spruce numbers"" which supposedly are adjusted for vacant properties. Yet, there is no detailed mention of the numbers and equations used to generate their numbers. Furthermore, given the weight they place on a 2.0% difference, I would think they would confirm their analysis using an independent accounting/finance firm. Also, they mention this 2% difference as being significant, yet they don't mention the normal industry standard or analyst expected increases for a triple net REIT. If the expected growth is 0.5-2.5%, then I see their point. If positive growth can range from 1-20%, then their point is not as relevant.",

"Why go back just one year, then add in vacancies and call it a ""trend""?  Since O has always excluded vacancies from SSR then to be consistent the author should go back several years and calculate adjusted values for each prior year, then he could say if there is a trend or not.  Also, he did not address dividend coverage, which is really critical in deciding if there is going to be a decline in the stock price.However, it is nice to hear a contrary view in order to gain some perspective.  It is disturbing that a board member has no relevant experience, but is simply a golf pro. I don't know if that's really the case, but if it's true then shareholders need to bring it up at the next stockholders meeting.",
when someone takes the time and invests in an article I find it rude to call it crop or a lie. his views and opinions differ from those who love the company. if he is right and prices drop 40% it will hurt my portfolio. but if they don't cut divident I'll still make 5.12 % per year. my horizon is 27 years. they will eventually bounce back. giving me the choice to buy  at lower cost. they are 2 years away from being an aristocrat. Entering that realm will create more cash and stock value. there tendens are quite diverse. many safe frome e commerce. you can't eat online or go to an online gym for instance. yes O is declining and that's a first for them.

Horrible Article by this hedge fund. I’m Buying and he can pay off my mortgage. Great management team,
"I disagree with your assessment but I always appreciate serious analysis of downside risk. I thought O was seriously overvalued and sold half of my position at $65 and completely exited the position at $69. I recently re-initiated 1/2 of the position at $53 and doubled down yesterday at $50. I plan to add if it falls further. I agree that there will be short-term pains with rising interest rates - NNN should get hit the hardest. However, the company has very high occupancy, high renewal rates, a low cost of capital, and low debt. The retail portfolio is strategically located in high value locations that aren't going anywhere. Tenant will always want those locations. This is short-term analysis, not long-term thinking. I hope that the price drops to $28/share; at an annual dividend of $2.628, that would imply a 9.39% dividend yield! I'd take it any day of the week.",
"Wow. No mention of the off balance sheet assets that implies the company is significantly undervalued...SAD. Ben, I thought you were more through in your analysis.

The rebuilt of the 2016 SSR pool is nicely done. How do you get the 17 million for the vacant 91 properties?,
This report is an attempt to repair an existing short position?,
"Personally like O, do think this is something of a hit piece but hey, this thread is eerily reminiscent of how Kinder Morgan investors piled on back when anyone suggested that might be a bad investment.    If you’re in O for the dividend this is probably a buying opportunity.  Just be sure you’re diversified.",

"While I disagree with the ""Amazon will eat and kill all"" thesis (moving groceries on-line and structurally changing the path to market of prescription medications is not quite as logistically easy or impending as many would infer) and the ""death of the theater"" thesis (streaming has been around for a while and ticket sales and box office receipts have done reasonably well, not to mention the ""experience and social"" aspect of the theater industry), if nothing else, the presentation might cause folks to look critically at the company rather than blindly buying it.  I am nervous when bankers run companies as well, but that does not mean that they do not have the ability to manage the company.  Saying that people on the audit committee are weak because they work(ed) for companies whose reputations have been tarnished is a disservice to the profession. When Lehman failed, were all their employees shady?  Can one say that KPMG has been tarnished so their employees are weak - what firms have your forensic accountants worked for?  Have they ever been questioned?  I am not long Realty Income, nor an I a cheerleader of the REIT, these are just my observations.  As I said earlier, hopefully your analysis will raise eyebrows and cause folks to question their investment thesis (as everyone should, regularly), critically look at the company and arrive at their own decision to buy/sell/hold.  I am not dismissive of short-sellers as I have seen them reveal corporate issues numerous times and believe they have a necessary role in analysis and markets.",
"I think the author  is right. O is a much bigger risk than it used to be.However, I hope he's wrong. You see, I'm long.  Maybe too long.",
"Historically, I’m pretty sure REITs rise during rate hikes (early 2000’s), contrary to popular belief, because rents rise along with it. If I remember correctly, O has a superior credit rating to its peers which will help keep cost of capital low through interest rate pressures.Additionally, isn’t a higher ratio of expiring leases vs. peers a positive assuming it can turn more leases over quicker as rates (& presumably rents) rise? I see it as an opportunity to mark-to-market.Would love to know what the author thinks..",
"Although I sold my entire position in O at $64 over a year ago, I am eager to initiate a new position at current levels.  There are so many REITs selling at bargain prices now, it is difficult to choose!  I still consider O one of the more solid picks in the REIT space.",
"There are so many weaker names in the retail REIT sector, why for God's sake would anyone *short* O?Let's say this author isn't crazy and O declines.  Is it really going to collapse enough to cover the high cost of shorting (margin + covering the dividend)?I doubt the sky will fall for O.  It will experience volatility in line with the rest of the REIT space.  But it's hardly ""priced for perfection,"" particularly in relation to peers.I'm recently long O.  I think it will struggle for a while (along with most REITs), but will rebound eventually, paying you a handsome dividend in the meanwhile.  I have a lowball limit order pending to buy more.--TBC",
This report confirms my gut feeling on O.,
"This article is something one can expect in this media driven world.  Information moves very quickly through the system and one can make significant $'s if you are on the right side of it.  It would be more helpful if accusations were substantiated  -  ""We do not have any direct evidence to suggest Mr. Chapman has done anything bad.""This article could very well have some truth...time will tell.  Overall a fair price is most likely somewhere in the 40s versus 70s.  Yield is keeping the valuation strong.This articles framework could be used for any company with a very high out of balance valuation. Identify a highly overvalued company with similar attributes,  build an article using this example, establish a short position, publish, repeat.",

"They should change the name of this outfit from Spruce Point to Spruce Goose. Much ado about nothing. Sure, it got off the ground, flew a short distance and came down with a thud. Now, it resides in some out of the way warehouse, a dusty relic of bygone days. This “in-depth” report from the boys at Spruce Goose is destined for a similar fate IMHO. Lost all credibility at the point where authors suggested that O would be pressured by the malls changing to triple net lease models upon tenant renewals, LOL. Clear the runway, boys. The Spruce Goose and its harried crew are hobbling in. Jack",
You lost me at saying their tenant quality is deteriorating.  I am under the belief that their tenant quality is improving.Please keep shorting it though as I would love to buy more at a lower price/higher yield. If you can do that for me I would be most appreciative. In the mean time I will just have to settle for my ever growing income stream.,
"A reasonable analysis but clearly jumping the shark. Grocery is not the business it once was. But neither is it going away. Movies are an event younger generations will put their cell phones down for. I will give them drug stores with a long tail. But mail delivery is nothing new here. But again like DIY home improvement, service can be the key difference. O has established their reputation as the best management team in this space. Also came through the credit crisis in better condition than competitors. While more disclosure is always better for analysis. The O teams established record does allow them to keep this data obscured from competitors.  Finally retail sales are very strong. While incomes are actually increasing. Amazon did not bother with badly run Whole Foods on a whim. It maybe things are not as bright as other real estate and retail economic cycles. But to claim o is overvalued by 25% to 45% is clearly jumping the shark. This is something very different from a B mall stock.",

"Comparing same store rents is definitely worthwhile, but excluding the billions in acquisitions over the last couple of years seems to be excluding a huge reason why they are able to continue increasing the dividend.

"regarding this statementAt $28 to $35 range as suggested would correspond to 9.4% to 7.5% yield. Besides 2009, has the yield ever been so high? Either way, I'd be selling everything I own to buy O at those levels.good strategy",
"O going to $30-35 range? Even if the issues described are true, this would bring the entire REIT industry to its knees!",
"O has been a disappointment for sure.  I am now negative for the entire position.  I've held on thinking O would turn around (and it might), rewarding me for holding.  Now, I wish I had sold when I had a profit of some kind.  Investing never does get easy.  I'm not sure I buy into this article, but it might be time for all of us to consider the current retail environment that O is involved in.  Not so much what shape O is in, but what shape the retail sector is in, and will be in for awhile.  Second guessing, hindsight,  difficult time right now.  Good investing to all.  Find a good bargain in today's ashes.",

"Retail sq ft per capita in the US is twice the next country (Australia) and 3-5x of Western Europe.  The difference in GDP per capita only explains a tiny portion of that difference.  Amazon and others are squeezing retail margins and creating cost pressures that force retail sf to be downsized.I've heard from folks who study such things that retail sales / sf are rising as space is being eliminated.  I admit I haven't seen that hard data, but it makes sense to me until I see otherwise.Be careful retail REITs.  Some are very well managed, I agree, but I hate owning a stock where you have to swim against the current to succeed.",

If so, then it will pay to wait until this shakes out, but it may be several years.  But then why did WB take such a hefty position in STOR?  And I wonder if it also applies to medical REITS.

I have looked at their recent financial statements myself, and nothing jumps out at me about them to raise any concerns.  But I have NOT dug into the footnotes the way ""deep throat"" has done for Alibaba.  That is usually where the bodies are buried. Having said that, you should be aware that Chinese accounting rules and regulations are not considered to be at the level of those of the U.S. and Europe.  A few years ago there were a number of cases of smaller Chinese companies going public in the U.S. that turned out to be shams.  Those cases did cause Chinese authorities to start paying more attention to financial reporting standards in China.  And it does seem the new Chinese president is cracking down more on corruption in China, including in the business world.  But that may also have something to do with him consolidating his power base.I should also point out that since JD and Alibaba have chosen to issue stock on U.S. exchanges, they are required to produce financial reports that conform to U.S. GAAP rules.  But as a retired CFA/CPA, I can tell you that doesn't mean as much as we wish it would.I am long JD myself, but please don't take that as my endorsement for anyone else to follow my lead.

"William I may have missed a LLL comment including this article about Samsung's expansion plans.http://bit.ly/2BuyDIP'Predicting tightness in supply and demand of DRAM chips due to rising demand from data center businesses, Samsung is currently expanding its DRAM production by building a new fabrication line on the second floor of the clean room in its newest plant in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province.The new facility’s capacity is expected to be 60,000 wafers, about a sixth of the company’s total DRAM production capacity, according to the industry. When the expansion plan was released in November, DRAM prices temporarily nosedived 21.4 percent in one week, due to oversupply worries.'This is somewhat old news if it was first reported in November but it doesn't sound like it matches up with the company line of offsetting wafer losses to technology transitions?  Are they losing 1/6 of their wafers in moving from 1X to 1Y or is this a net expansion in wafer capacity?",

"I would tend to believe, that these trends bode well for Micron and to those who remain invested in this company. Best to the BoBs' and a prosperous future. Thanks so much William for your solid efforts, very much appreciated - calDemand for compute, storage, and network capacity around the world is huge, and growing. Every day, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. The digital universe is growing 40% each year. An increasing share of that demand comes from video. According to Cisco’s latest analysis, it would take more than 5 million years to watch the amount of video that will cross global IP networks each month in 2021.  It’s growing fast, too: Cisco predicts that Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) traffic will increase 20-fold between 2016 and 2021 globally  IoT may be the most significant driver of future increases in demand around the world. A new Business Insider report projects that there will be a total of 22.5 billion IoT devices in 2021, up from 6.6 billion in 2016.  The impact on data centers would be huge; according to industry veteran Mark Thiele, “If the numbers follow a historical precedent at all we will need roughly 400 million servers to support our 2020 IoT and technology demands. In order to have enough data centers for 400 million servers we would need to add another 4,000 massive data centers measuring roughly 400,000 sq. ft. with approximately 50 megawatts of power each.” http://bit.ly/2BYrgukHow much infrastructure will be needed to support the Internet of Things? Industry veteran Mark Thiele, Chief Strategy Officer at Apcera, recently ran an analysis.“If the numbers follow a historical precedent at all we will need roughly 400 million servers to support our 2020 IoT and technology demands,” said Thiele. “Let’s look at what 400 million servers means to data centers. A massive data center with 5,000 racks with 20 servers per rack has 100,000 servers. In order to have enough data centers for 400 million servers we would need to add another 4,000 massive data centers measuring roughly 400K SF with approximately 50 megawatts of power each.” http://bit.ly/2vFOtuGNew Approaches for A New Data AgeIt’s no surprise that our world will be awash in data in 2025. But what is startling is volume of data: 163 zettabytes (ZB), a ten-fold increase over what was created in 2016, according to a recent report by analyst firm IDC and sponsored by Seagate. The report also identifies other disruptive data trends reshaping the global datasphere, such as the increasing life-critical nature of data to society, the shift of data to the cloud and the surge in devices that create data without human involvement.http://bit.ly/2BWHhRdAnd this;http://bit.ly/2BrRt39",

"There will be new demand for DRAM from new crytocurrency machine. Now the bit coin machine market is dominated by ASIC type machine which has higher mining efficiency,  cost much more power and need very few DRAM like 512M per machine. However as the quantity of Bitcoin are getting less, the machine makers are shifting to Ethereum. One of the main maker Bitmain is going to develop a new machine ""F3"" which is using ETHASH algorithm asking for high bandwidth memory and cost less power. Each F3 mining machine will need 72GB DRAM compared the current 512M DRAM by S9 mining machine. Bitman is sourcing 3000 WPM from Taiwan DRAM makers. Hope Micron is putting effort to catch the opportunities. When F3 come to market in 2Q CY18, the GPU market will suffer because F3 power consumption is much lower than previous ASIC machine and more efficient than GPU.",

"El-Erian on the markets In the latest POLITICO Money podcast I talk to Allianz chief economic adviser and potential future Fed Vice Chair Mohamed A. El-Erian about Wall Street's wild ride of the last few days.He argues the recent roller-coaster ride represents a perfectly normal return to volatility and shouldn't freak anyone out. The surprise was that markets ran ahead so far so fast without any pull back over the last couple years:""We are coming from a period in which there was virtually no financial market volatility whatsoever. Last year alone we saw six of the seven lowest measures for volatility in history... Equity markets went a very long way up very quickly and you tend to get technical corrections, you tend to get air pockets.""El-Erian said the declines did not represent any fundamental problem with the economy. Instead, they showed traders trying to come to terms with an accelerating economy that will likely lead to higher interest rates:""The market was surprised by better than expected job creation and looked at wages and thought, 'Wow they are coming back,' which is good for the economy but it's different from what they have seen in the past ... And there was a reaction in the fixed-income market, the bond market, which was a significant rise in yields. I think that reflects a healthy economy. Interest rates are going up for good reason.""NOT WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION - El-Erian on the rise in wages and the glut of tax cut stimulus: ""Somewhat higher inflation - as long as it's contained, and I think it will be contained - and higher wage growth is actually part of the solution and not part of the problem.""",

And, Castellano provides charts that show the drop in MU NAND demand, due to its big competitors and the market for NAND.Let's look at today's price drop.

"I'm 100% with you :-)  Micron is way undervalued considering the huge earning it is producing.  Even with half as much earning the stock is undervalued!  It is the scare factor of memory cycles that's kept the price down. But by all accounts the dynamics of the memory market has changed. It's no longer PC cycles driving this. We now see huge memory demand for servers, machine learning/AI (autonomous driving, etc), smart phones and IoT. There are no signs this demand is slowing anytime soon. Once the market accepts this new paradigm, there is no stopping Micron from reaching 80s and higher.",

"Michael, don’t worry your analysis was 100pc even at $20. This MLP is way too cheap I bought more yesterday (all the way from down here in Sydney!) and this is just a perfect example a listed company not appropriately managing the sell side research expectations. It is very very clear that 2019 2020 this MLP is going to have strong FFO growth and unfortunately the sell side research had it starting sooner. It’s now dirt cheap in my view.

In the industry, and I am aware of delays and unintennded hiccups, so I believe this is a 2019 story...  And Mr. Fitzimmons I relied on an analyst who had this rated as a top pick with a price target of 29... I added my position on the day of earning feeling the  market had it wrong  given what ETP did a couple of days before..   The analyst has yet to comment, but it is pretty clear to me, I will need to average down... by the way, the 12 % yield is a nice thing....One final point, you make money on the buys.... not on the sells...

"Mr. Fitzsimmons:   Not at all.  You don't guarantee anybody any result and your analysis was certainly reasonable. The reason that compression won't be needed for two years is that the well pressure is unusually and unexpectedly high, which you could not have predicted.

"Michael Fitzsimmons,From December until mid-January ""Pipeline Water Vapor Freezing"" Caused Delays!During December and even more so the first week of January I learned that there were a number of unexpected pipeline issues stemming from the water vapor intrinsic to natural gas transportation in this manner being vulnerable to sudden, severe downturns in temperatures. Although, it was widely known that the Bakken Basin was severely affected, even as far South as Texas, with Texas and Oklahoma's pipeline systems reporting a 20% and 22% net volume decline. Though the attention focused on North Dakota, where Hettinger, North Dakota reported temperatures below -45 F, and Continental Resources, the 2nd largest Natural Gas producer there reluctantly admitted that ""Freeze-Ups had caused reductions"", they refused to quantify that. The Marcellus Gas production was also down at least 5% despite increased activity but there have been a few acknowledgements with many denials as to who, where and specifically how much of an impact. The Utica shale-basin will naturally be very much in step with the Marcellus, insofar as negative-externalities go,  like the ephemeral impact and quantified effects of ""Freeze-Offs"" throughout the system.

"'Xom', and 'Enb', that your long on are examples of candidates for 'Core Holdings', plus Chevron, which if I recall make 3/3 in terms of long core positions we both share. Along those lines, this, high yielding 'Credit Rating Challenged' well situated Midstream is what we might consider a 'Speculative-Play', worth an 1% investment or less, but certainly worthwhile.Question Becomes Comparative Values?How does this Midstream compare to equally high yielding MLPs, such as 'AHGP', 'BPL' or 'ETP'? Maybe all 4 make decent 'Speculative', Discretionary plays. A thousand units of each pays a handsome distribution, though risks should keep the investment small, and closely watched. I done this with the 3 I've mentioned, but have found that though they pay large Distributions, there's a lack of certainly that Exxon, Enbridge, and Chevron protect investors from. In essence, Exxon and Chevron may be trading sharply lower than before the 'State of the Union', but I haven't fretted over it. For good reason too, they're very solid as Common Shares go. Buckeye, a company which I have had a 'Speculative' trust holding in for almost 20 years was one I never worried about until I replaced Occidental shares with Buckeye Units last Spring, in my Discretionary fund. At that larger scale I began watching and noticing the Dilution, the Hurricane season, the nuances including Venezuela's potential default on their account and the rollercoaster the Unit prices rode on. In essence, very good article which pointed out the Utica-Shale Pipeline opportunity, the high yield stuck for now, like Buckeye, as well as the risk of a mediocre credit rating in an interest rate rising environment. All in all a good speculative candidate.",

"Mr. Fitzsimmions:   SMLP closed today unchanged at $21.70. Is that adequate to entice you to start a position? I have a meaningful position at $22.96, for a 10% yield on my cost, and I'm happy with that. I think that after the 2020 payment is made all inhibitions known today to unit price increases will be gone.   Elliot Miller",

"I think one lesson to learn from Horsehead was that when a company appears to be facing a cashflow shortage, it provides cover to management to collude with vulture investors and creates a case in bankruptcy for the debtholders to claim that upon liquidation there would be no equity left.  In the case of Aimia, current cash flows are in no way a guarantee of what will remain after 2020; debtholders could clearly claim that a liquidation of the company would result in zero equity; and management has little skin in the game, meaning they are vulnerable to a Horsehead-type bargain with debtholders and the circumstances would give them good cover.  Granted, this sounds like a remote scenario, but if you read Guy Spier's and the rest of the equity committee's coverage of what happened with Horsehead, you realize that justice does not always prevail and you remember that people follow incentives (the fact pattern suggests that ZINC's management was wooed by the promise of rich rewards and low chance of paying a penalty for allowing the company to miss its interest payment).  The fact that Aimia has high uncertainty cuts both ways: it not only creates a low stock price (and the potential for great equity returns) but it also creates an opportunity for unsavory vulture investors to collude with management.  Chances are low that this happens, but this business case is naturally a more promising hunting ground for vulture investors than others; it's a vulnerability.",
"Speaking of Pabrai, I'm reminded of Horsehead, which was a case where some simple debt maturities that should have been covered by cash flows created an opportunity for some vulture investors to buy the debt and collude with management to let it default, which transferred massive value to debtholders and bankrupted the company.  It caught Pabrai totally off guard, and although I'm a shareholder in Aimia I don't have the insight into how to avoid situations like that one in all cases unless you stick to companies that can immediately liquidate their debt.",
"Thanks for a great article. Aimia reminds me of the book, the Dhando Investor, in which Pabrai discusses the allure of equities with Low Risk, HIGH Uncertainty.  AIM is a textbook example.  I will feel a lot more comfortable when Mittleman gets a board seat or two.",
Mittleman filing is interesting. Would love to see them get a board seat. We could certainly expect a pop if and when they do.,

"I think you should summarize your points from both article in a neat power point presentation and send it to one of the activist investors that are about to start getting involved, such as Mittleman. Although we can't assume that management is not already considering some of these, an active board can force management to ensure that the existing value in terms of buying power and name recognition doesn't just evaporate, as clearly there are multiple avenues to realizing that value. It doesn't take Steve Jobs to run this company, that's for sure. Maybe a better board, that would probably do it. Thanks for your article and analysis!",

Well one thing is for sure is there are worse quality companies out there trading at a P/E higher than 25. Waste Management is as steady as they come I would not mind adding at sub $80. It is all about future cash flows. When your moat is that wide i think a 25 P/E is justified. Thats just me I also hope they will be active in M&A in scooping up some of the smaller regional garbage companies. It would be nice if the P/E was 15 but the future cash is inevitable and the management is solid.,

That's the problem when paying up for premium companies. Thank god, I don't do it very often.",
"sorry to disagree.  Even after the last market correction, WM is still overvalued.",
"Thanks Brad. I am sorry to hear about your pay cut. I was not trying to bash you and I am sure many readers thank you for not repeating the obvious that I am unaware of as that is annoying. I guess my suggestion would be to reference such article so someone interested in the stock could click and find out what the growth factors are. It is not you I am complaining about. This site used to be great but it is dying. To many articles that have no meaning or depth, whereas even a year ago I could come here and gather some good info. I am educated and can see through the BS writers and the good ones. Not saying you are not a good one but the articles I was used to seeing are becoming harder to come by and this article is hopefully not what you consider your best work.Your article above uses the DCF model which I can do in 2 minutes in Excel. (It would be really easy to program Excel to actually do it for me.) Easy analysis in my mind but to others it may be useful. I would guess this model was done short handed and you did a quick pull of some numbers off the websites mentioned above, throw them into a spreadsheet and made an article. If you want followers and a pay raise this is my recommendation. Go read a Scott Kennedy article on Altria. I read many articles on stocks and I give feedback as I like many readers are always interested to hear another person's view when they dive in. However, one model is not sufficient, it take several models actually to tell the story of a stock. Hence, what you will find in Mr. Kennedy's articles would give you a good basis on what you might consider including in an article to get a nice following and therefor a raise. I learned in school is that accounting tells one side of the story while the full evaluation of a company tells another. Finance taught me to dive into the operations of a company, evaluate how each division is performing and how well management at the top recognized where to allocate resources. This is useful information as WM might figure out a way to make a 70% margin on a new product and see significant growth in this division over the next 5 years, thus growing earnings by the amount you stated above. Or maybe not, however, you only presented information you found on other websites so how do readers even know this is credible data in your DCF model. Hence why a simplified version of the DCF=Not a great article=less readers. Again, I am not trying to talk down or insult you. I am trying to motivate and challenge you to be better. I know you need to make a living but writing on SeekingAlpha is probably not a great career choice.Lastly, some day when I have time I will cover some stocks and perform this analysis service. One thing to know is I am well compensated at my regular job but my analysis will be free to readers as Mr. Kennedy and myself see the world in the same view. Like him, I believe that this information should be free to people who cannot afford to get it anywhere else.Thanks for the article and best of luck in the future.",

WM has the potential to grow worldwide and to continue developing and implementing plans of waste as energy. I'm less excited about WM's FCF and debt. Some of WM's red flags can be recognized due to the heavily regulated nature of the waste industry in the U.S. After analyzing the technicals, I believe WM has the potential to fall a little further.",

"Thanks for the article for this largely unnoticed stock.  I think there is lots to like about TUP.  Here are a few:+  they dropped beauty control which has been a money loser for years.  We should see some benefit from this going forward.  And in the sale, which I believe was for an undisclosed amount, there is an arrangement for future income based on the buyers success.  So maybe a little added to profits there.+  they continue to own some land that they can sell. This is a nice cushion to their balance sheet.  I need to look through 10K to have a clearer picture of their land assets.+  China is a big market and growing near 20% - management looks for that growth to continue.  +  They are taking some painful steps in restructuring now but we should see the benefits in 2019 and beyond.  Could see a great return when restructuring benefits kick in.+ their business is very diversified.

"As a long time (50 year) shareholder with a great deal of fondness for this company, those looking to purchase should be aware of the following:WOR is rather cyclical.  Their steel inventory gets marked to market, generating accounting profits when steel prices are climbing and losses when they are falling.  The market responds to these quarterly earnings, even though they do not reflect the health of the underlying business.  This can create opportunities to pick up shares at cyclical lows.  Their employee compensation has a substantial profit sharing component. This has served them very well over the years, and somewhat dampens the effect of volume cycles.  For decades, WI has been working to diversify their markets and customers and to move to higher value add businesses.  Much of this has been through acquisition.  Some have been successful, some less so, such as their foray into steel building framing (spun off into a JV), low volume automotive service stamping (not sure where that went), and entry into tanks for oil and gas drilling right around the peak of the fracking boom several years ago (poor timing, but may turn out to be a good investment long term).  I expect them to continue to make acquisitions, hopefully with more consistent success.  My preference would be for them to pay down a little more debt and support their organic growth opportunities, and to be very opportunistic in the acquisition area.  .  They have also pursued new technologies from time to time, such as trying to make auto air conditioning compressors that did not require refrigerant (back in the 1980's, as I remember) and their energy innovations business, which is now being spun off.  Other product initiatives  have done well, like their single use helium tanks for consumers.They have been involved in quite a few joint ventures, the most successful of which is WAVE.  WOR receives millions in cash each year from their JVs.  They use JVs both to enter new markets and to spin off non-core lines of business.  The fiscal year ends in May, and they always seem to have a strong 4th quarter.  Maybe they practice a little accounting squirrelling away via some accruals in the first couple of quarters to generate a strong fourth quarter.  Just a guess on my part, I have zero inside information.My guess is that the dividend is an important source of income to the controlling family, so it seems to be something of a priority.  It was cut back in the Great Recession, but has been raised consistently since then and now exceeds the former level.  I would expect another $.01/qtr increase announcement in late June. It has been a great investment for our extended family. Conveniently for us, it has morphed from a growth stock in the 70's and 80's to more of a dividend growth stock in recent years.  New buyers should not expect the growth WOR had in those earlier decades, but rather a continuation of the last 10-20 years.",Worthington Industries: A Closer Look

"France Survey of Vitaros Satisfactionhttp://bit.ly/2BZht76Introduction This study was carried out to assess how Vitaros®, a year after its release on the market, is being used to treat erectile dysfunction and how both patients and doctors perceive this drug. Method Observations were made of 117 physicians (sexual medicine specialist, urologist, or general practitionners), to evaluate how Vitaros® is actually be used. Results Seventy-two percent of these doctors were satisfied with Vitaros® after having prescribed it. Sixty-five percent of the patients who took it were satisfied or very satisfied – a percentage rises to 73 % when the prescribing doctor  has explained to patients the need to take several doses before judging results, and to 79 % among patients to whom doctors prescribe it as a first-line treatment. Conclusion Vitaros®, the most recent pharmacological treatment of erectile dysfunction, broadens the supply of therapeutic resources offered to patients. Its effects can be optimized by associating the prescription with relevant information and by prescribing it as a first-line treatment.http://bit.ly/2BzKK7g SexologiesVolume 25, Issue 3, July–September 2016, Pages 128–132Sexualité : handicaps et vulnérabilités — Rédacteur invité / Guest editor : Alain Giami",

"Allergan China-""We will buy early stage products to develop and market further”! Allergan's overseas new strategy seems like it fits perfectly with an Apricus deal once Vitaros/DDAIP is approved. “What we are not going to do : mega deals. We will not go into that. But we will buy early stage-products that we will develop and market further, the closer they are to launch, the better,” he said without giving further details. The recent purchase of Repros is exactly that, a PH3 ready drug with proellex, a trial that Repros could not afford to do. Plus proellex may be able to benefit from local delivery with DDAIP because of systemic side effects with the pill form.http://reut.rs/2BjG3OZ Botox-maker Allergan has embarked on a big push in China where it plans to hire 200 additional staff this year and will also be on the lookout for potential acquisitions in the country, a senior executive told Reuters on Friday.",
"Here’s highlights of FDA communication from APRI conf. calls since 8/16Aug 4 , 2016 US Vitaros resubmission strategy. …. These activities include completing several new non-clinical studies, compiling a Phase 3 trial responders analysis…... We have conducted additional toxicology and pharmacology studies to best answer key questions. We have engaged several world-class subject matter experts to review our data and to help us to address these deficiencies, and we have established a productive dialogue with the FDA. We believe that the majority of the CMC or manufacturing efficiencies have been previously addressed as part of the approvals in Europe. It should be noted that the current body of data include several new supportive studies as mentioned above, a new responders analysis from the original Phase 3 clinical studies and the extensive post marketing safety data from Europe, all of which were not previously available to the FDA for review. Nov. 18, 2016 Apricus Biosciences Provides Update on Vitaros NDA Following Receipt of FDA Feedback Specifically, the FDA provided clarity on the requirements needed to address the deficiencies in the 2008 Complete Response letter to include suggested additional analysis of existing clinical and non-clinical data. The FDA feedback did not indicate that new clinical studies would be required for re-submission……….. “Importantly, ... we can further strengthen our clinical benefit section in the planned re-submission, using a methodology provided to us by the FDA. AUG 2, 2017 The NDA submission contains data that we believe addresses all of the issues raised by the FDA in the original Vitaros complete response letter. The results of our successful human factor studies, as well as a significant amount of supportive data from the Vitaros global safety database, which we believe enhances the Vitaros risk benefit profile…. we have continued to have a very healthy dialogue with the FDA along the way and with the division Nov 2017 As expected, we are in dialogue with the FDA on an ongoing basis with respect to the submission. . As expected, we - as I said, we have had a dialogue with the FDA. They have asked for qualification on certain issues, and we provided that. Leading up to the decision date, we'll continue to have that sort of working relationship with the FDA. And so far, it's been very positive.",

Vitaros only needs to prove safety of DDAIP with the FDA. Efficacy and CMC issues have been addressed. This CRL, resubmission NDA is all about safety studies around DDAIP, since the active ingredient alprostadil has been approved for ED for many years now. Only 2 things need to be addressed now with DDAIP: Safety risk to User and Partner. So what do they have to prove Safety risk to User and Partner: 1. 2.5% DDAIP risk issues have been successfully addressed resulting in approvals in 29 countries. 2. Conducted several additional supportive pre-clinical studies to address partner safety risk.      See 2 studies below that posted on PubMed, not all added studies have been posted.

"they made a big mistake when they sold the USA rights to Vitaros in 2009, then it bounced around the M&A circuit for years, originally the FDA only asked for minor safsty studies on DDAIP, which would have cost $5M, but the mismanaged company was broke, and the EMA was more willing to approve without more studies, there has been many ups and downs since 2008, the device was not properly developed, the formula, refrigeration, regulatory issues,  cash issues,now they have have all their eggs in one basket, USA Vitaros approval,  if approved which looks good, their next product Rayva gets partnered, Rayva is a drug with unmet need, good patent protection, is the same thing as Vitaros - DDAIP with Alprostadil for the hands in Raynauds, plus they have 2 more years to patent other combos of DDAIP not counting a few they have, it's not a billion dollar company by any means, but could be sold for 150 to 200 M, that's 6-10 bucks a share, keep in mind any alprostadil product with DDAIP will not go generic because there are no systemic blood levels that can be detected. we'll know soon.",

"Here's my take on the situation. All large mining companies, including Norilsk, were frightened by the recent commodity bear market. Capex went way down. It's still down. My view is that the long run outlook for many metals (like nickel) is actually quite good. Capex now will wind up being quite profitable. So I favor P over D.But that's not how the short term market sees it. The Russian owners are mostly in it for the long term. The marginal owner is in the west. This owner implies a much higher cost of capital to Russian investments than to western ones. See the discussion above. So they favor dividends and quick return of capital. Because of this, the stock will likely be weak for awhile. Just my opinion.",
"I have owned Norilsk (NILSY) at least a couple times over the years- maybe more.  Back in the Fall of 2011 they announced a tender offer that was one for the ages.  I remember when the oligarchs were fighting for control of the company and the tender was announced.  They paid $30.60 a share in U.S. dollars for a stock that was trading at around $19 a share.  Yes, that was a profit of about 60% and you only needed to hold the stock for about a month.  Several people told me it was too good to be true- two friends who had lived in Russia cautioned me about the political risk.There was a clause saying that if you had 999 shares or less that they would take them all.  I bought 900 to be safe.  All 900 of the shares were taken and this ended up being one of the most memorable of the many tender offers that I've ever participated in.Another note- the offer was made available on a limited basis to citizens of Russia.  There was an article in the Wall St. Journal that showed thousands of Russians standing in line with temperatures around freezing- waiting for many hours for a chance to open a brokerage account and participate in the NILSY tender offer.  Something like 15-20% of the people were allowed to open accounts and participate.  Yet I could sit at the comfort of my desk without getting bundled up, click my mouse a few times and participate.  What a country!  Oh yeah, the name is ""Norilsk""- it is NOT ""no risk""...",
"I have NILSY for couple years, I have no problem of owning it at all. The most fear I have not the company, not Russia and definitively not Putin, is American policy towards Russia. I think nationalization is bad but sanction just as evil. Nowadays Germany is just as evil as Hitler's Germany. Hitler used military might to conquer Europe, now Markel used Muslim to flood the whole Europe since she has no heir of her own, in order words, she has no future stake in Germany/company, she does not care, in the end, 50 or 100 years from now, it will be Muslim Europe,why? One man one vote, just likes in S. Africa.....If Putin is a bad man, he can just shut off the gas line, then the whole Europe will be frozen to death.",
"Another nice article, LR. There is political risk everywhere. The issue in Russia is that few Americans are plugged into it, so problems usually come as a complete surprise. If you do follow Russia, you do have a better indication of what will come.Here's my view. Putin may be an autocrat, but he wants to develop the Russian economy. Within the context of his retaining power, he will generally be OK for Russian companies. If the businessmen are supportive of his power and are helping the economy, they will not have any surprises. Right now Nornickel appears to be in that situation. The problem will come if ownership decides to become too politically independent. I don't see that now.Also, I'm not too worried about sanctions. Nornickel produces commodities that are fungible worldwide, and China is the major buyer.",
"Great points on the human nature of risk taking.  The preferred shares of Fannie and Freddie were considered so safe as to qualify as tier 1 capital for community banks.

Investors must realize that they will pay a high price for a rosy outlook.  And that it difficult to drive by only looking through the rear view mirror.",

"So pro short sellers are in very very deep here, with over 12M shares short. If one assumes Blackstone Group and Mason Hawkins, both of whom sit on the BOD and control the debt,  retain 1/2 of the fully diluted shares, that means well over 60% of the float is lent out short. That is a very crowded short, which can be dangerous. So what can go wrong here and is not considered in Kerrisdale Capital Management's short thesis? A significant asset sale that can rationalize the balance sheet, and put to rest covenant concerns, imo. There are some potentially valuable assets that can be divested at Kodak, and market cap is not a pie in the sky number,  from a SOP valuation.

It seems very unhealthy to me.With regards to the article: ""Tesla’s technological advantage is slim or even nonexistent, and it’s facing a growing stable of competitors with more resources and more expertise."" 1) Why did you quote sales numbers from October given that Model 3 is the key volume and the production ramp (through end of December with January estimates) is very well documented?2) How can a tech advantage be nonexistent when everyone else only has vaporware?",
I'm not as confident to short this quarter before earnings as I think revenue will beat and earnongs has been revised down alot and no one seems to care about the m3. Add in all the deposits for roadster/truck and some odd solar projects. I think next quarter will be a disaster though.,
"Worry about Tesla when the competition actually has a product that's more compelling, but other than a handful of high priced cars coming to market there is nothing that comes close to the Model 3 in looks, performance or features.Sales of the Bolt tanked last month as Model 3 is now over a thousand per week in production and continues to ramp up, earning Tesla 100 million last month and growing to 200 million this month with a gradual ramp to 2500 cars,,,, but Tesla's going to fail right??The recent market sell off hardly put a dent in Tesla stock and this year Tesla will outsell every other company in EV sales, so go ahead and short, SA bears are gluttons for punishment and ignore the fact that the Model 3 is destined to be the best selling EV for a few years at least seeing as there is simply nothing on the horizon that comes close to what it has to offer, which is a great car at a great price.",

"Everyone (both longs and shorts) either forgot this, or don't understand this, or don't believe this:1) Before joining and investing in Tesla, Elon Musk knew very well the car business sucks.  He did not go into the car business to make money for himself or for investors.2) The only reason of doing Tesla is to fight global warming, by motivating all legacy automakers to make EVs in large volume ASAP.  Same with grid storage.3) The whole idea is to drive down the price of EV-grade batteries and encourage EV competition worldwide.  Electric cars are actually easy to make -- just look at the VW e-Golf or the Chevy Bolt.  The battery is the ONLY issue, everything else is easy for the legacy auto makers.  (I am not talking about self driving cars here, that is a different topic).4) Tesla not making a profit is by design.  Elon Musk does not intend on making Tesla profitable for as long as he is CEO.  He actually said this if you research carefully.Most CEOs are there to make money for shareholders.  This is not the case with Elon Musk because his motivations are different (to him it is all about reducing CO2 emissions).  Look for Tesla to LOWER the price of the base model Model 3 as soon as they can. Grow yes. Cash flow yes.  To be profitable no.  This is to keep maximum pressure on legacy auto makers to make EVs in volume.  The #1 goal is to fight global warming.  All of Elon Musk's major decisions are based on this goal.The fight is with TIME.  We have limited time to reduce CO2 emissions so Manhattan is not flooded in 100 years.",

The whole point of disruption is to render the advantage of size irrelevant.   By being single-mindedly focused on exploiting a niche, the upstart manages to establish a foothold in an industry that thinks it knows better.Example: Southwest Airlines - started out as a pure-Texas carrier based on the theory that fares should not be compared to other carriers but the cost of driving the same distance...Example:  Microsoft:  IBM needed an operating system for their PC and gave the task to Microsoft - never thinking that the software would be far more important than their clear mastery of hardware...Example: Walmart - regional discount chain that destroyed Sears and many other retailers.Example: Facebook - remember MySpace? Example: Google - what is the advantage of a free search engine to anyone?Example: SpaceX - Boeing didn't care - no experience..etc.Time after time, people over-estimate the importance of size and wealth.   The fact is that the competition does not have a single BEV vehicle in volume production (over 100,000 per annum)Jaguar's IPace isn't even made by Jaguar - Car and Driver:  Expect sales of the five-seater to commence in the middle of 2018, with a target starting price under $100,000. The I-Pace will be built by Magna Steyr in Austria.Whatever ""advantage"" the car companies have over Tesla is destroyed by the dealer network that understands that selling an electric vehicle is going to destroy their service department revenues down the road.   They don't want to waste time selling a consumer on a thin-margin car with weird technology the they have hundreds of SUVs on the lot with fat margins and plenty of reasons for the customer to service their vehicle with them.Tesla will win this battle and the ""competitors"" are already too far behind to catch up..",

"i am long Tesla and i have not regret it, its the company of the future and the cars are much more attractive than the existing conventional cars in terms of pricing, desing and performance. Of course it takes time to build the machine that builds machines and i guess it is likely to face further delays, but at the end of the day it will work. Being long Tesla is also a personal bet on Elon Musk, just look at his achievements.",
"I have personally been litigating with Tesla dba SolarCity since December 23rd of 2016, in Federal Court.  SolarCity attempted to damage my good name, after I disclosed concealed financial risks to clients, by bringing an action against me for Violation of Trade Secrets Acts, State and Federal.  The case is SolarCity v Doria.  Since that time I have counter-sued Tesla and they made the mistake, in April of 2017, of failing to oppose a motion to compel arbitration, which I later withdrew, solidifying our position in Federal Court, and forever waiving their right to Arbitration, through our contractual agreements.Tesla has failed to provide sufficient responses in response to a Court Order compelling 29-30 pieces of evidence.  Included in this evidence, are calculations of profits likely to exceed  two-billion five-hundred million dollars ($2,500,000,000), which were fraudulently gathered, by concealing information from clients regarding SRECs, and omitting material information in the like.As it relates to the Q4 conference call and Tesla's true cash position, I would imagine it is not expensive to litigate with me, as all I have at my disposal is a laptop, a printer, and some paper, yet Tesla recently stated to the Federal Courts, that litigating with me is posing a financial burden on the company, whilst they burn an approximated $100,000,000 in operational expenses.  I'm well aware that millions of people are unclear as to whether or not Tesla is ""blowing smoke"" in most situations, but for those that are and were on the inside, and have chosen to educate ourselves, absolutely no questions remains in our minds, as to the intent of Tesla, and how they go about getting the American Public to give them their money, whilst ""burning"" the American workforce.  #smokeandmirrors",
"""What we can say with confidence is that we are taking many actions to systematically address bottlenecks and add capacity in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints, and these actions should result in our production rate significantly increasing during the rest of Q1 and through Q2.""A significant increase from a very low base (say 500 to 600) isn't terribly comforting. It was nice to see confirmation of the fact the Gigafurnace remains almost as big a farce as the artisanal assembly in Fremont.At least the inventory fire sale seems to have gone well. Not profitably by any means but at least it opens up more parking space at service centers to handle M3 warranty and remedial work. On the down side - there is little inventory left for the Q1 fire sale.",
And as turned out we've got fewer worries. TSLA has managed to bring some pleasant moments this time.,
"Wow.  Tesla doesn't even believe they will hit their own Model 3 production targets:  ""It is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time.""",

"Holy smokes, $179M in ZEV sales!  Still, they were able to post a record loss.  I didn't think that would be possible.",
"Well the numbers are in and I wouldn't count Tesla out yet, Tesla's cash burn was nowhere near the billion dollar mark forecast by analysts and Model 3 ramp is still on schedule despite your doom and gloom outlook. Sales of Model 3 in January meant a hundred million went to Tesla, that number will double in February and if production does get to 5000 per week which is looking more and more likely, Tesla will be up to a billion per month in Model 3 sales alone sometime this year, certainly 2500 cars a week is attainable in the short term. Grid storage is also rapidly growing and solar sales will probably get a boost if Chinese panels are hit with a thirty percent tariff.Sales of Model S and X are not slowing either, and once again there is no real competition for the Model 3 on the immediate horizon.With Detroit being faced with transitioning it's gas burning money makers to electric and Dealerships expecting to sell cars that don't require much if any maintenance, I would say Tesla is in a far better position than the legacy automakers are going forward. The future lies in AI and autonomy, something Tesla and Silicon Valley also have as an advantage, as well as attracting some of the best and brightest talent in these fields.Detroit had better come up with something more compelling than the Model 3 in order to take the wind out of Tesla, but if things keep going the way they are, bailouts may come first.",
He just put one his cars in SPACE (complete with a copy of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy in the glovebox).   Earnings analysis have nothing to do with what drives this stock -it never has and it never will as long as Elon is alive.,
"Excellent article, thanks for posting it.",
"Very interesting links to the numerous quality problems. One guy had 3 closeup pics of his 'sunken' hood which was a 1/2 centimeter (per him) lower than the fender. He's in Maryland and Tesla is shipping a new hood, in black, which will go to a local authorized paint shop to paint it Red. He's afraid that the paint job won't exactly match and thus might instead live with the sunken hood. Unbelievable how anyone  can put up with such defects. Maybe the sunken hood is actually an advanced aerodynamic feature? Maybe Tesla needs a sinking fund to cover such?",
"The recent CNBC piece on Tesla earnings talked as much about the Rocket Launch as Model 3, and barely commented on the cash burn.  They showed photos of the Roadster in space with Bowie's ""Starman"" playing.  The earnings call should be similarly enlightening.",

Cash on hand is going to be key. How long can they survive without more capital?,
"Whatever the earnings report will be,  you try to time it you lose.  My advise is, if you own some now, hold it.  If it is good earnings report, the stock will fly, add more shares, if the earnings is bad and the stock tanks, add even more shares (obviously if it tanks you can add more shares than if it gaps up).  Just remember what Larry Page says:""if you can work for a man who wants to go to Mars and do not mind to devote all his resources and energy for it, why do you still want to work for somebody who is military contractor?""This endorsement just shows how magnetic person Musk is?  One rule to test if  an industry is rising or falling is to see if it attracts more and more above average people in its enthronement.   Tesla and Musk are leaders in a rising industry and more and more really smart (and wealthy) people are involved.  You bet against it you lose.  Simply as that.  No complexity here.",

So will this cushion allow for a minimal net decline in TSLA shares for the week?

"One of the line items on the Cash Flow Statement that should be watched closely is the ""Increase in Restricted Cash"" line item. This is cash on hand that cannot be used operationally due to the restrictions being placed on it by financial institutions, for example.Although it tends to get lost in the statement due to its current size, I believe we are going to see this line item increase as the financial statements deteriorate going forward.  At the end of the 3rd qtr 2017 the number was $ 172 Million and heading up from the first of the year at  $79 Million. This number will continue to grow upward, at least until additional equity being raised and quite possibly beyond. It is important to note that this restricted cash in effect offsets the amount of customer deposits on the books which are being thought of as operational cash assets. Thus, the value of these deposits are continually being eroded by the restricted cash increases. Something to watch for as the 4th quarter numbers are presented today.",

He's not pump and dump man",
"I expect that the numbers will look worse than they are for the earnings report.  This is because Tesla pushed the good numbers into January for Q1 2018 instead of Q4 2017.  This is because the dilution isn't coming for another three months.Nor will there be a going concern announcement as Tesla has a time frame after earnings are reported to report the problem.Both longs and shorts paid good money for this entertainment spectacle, and we should try to enjoy it.",
"If the analysts deviate from the 'I love Musk party line' and insist on answers about the status of the financial statements, the game is up for TSLA.After every earnings report, each Qtr, the analysts always include serious questions about the financial status of the company and how future financial targets are going to be met.  However, with TSLA/Musk the carefully selected company-friendly analysts avoid finances and, most importantly, the overwhelming Debt of the company.TSLA is choking on the incredible amount of Debt but analysts focus on nonsense that puts a positive spin in the Company.  Always a positive spin......",

"Elon is in full stock pump mode right now. The silly meaningless announcements (ie. Elon's compensation structure, or launching a Tesla roadster into space, etc) seem to imply that Elon knows that he needs to do another capital raise in the near future. With the sale of their future lease payments a couple of weeks ago, they have to be running out of options.I feel like Elon will announce something that he thinks will give the stock a boost, and will probably also provide unrealistic guidance for Q1 (after all, no one really holds him to that stuff) in order to get the stock price a little higher for a capital raise.I suspect that Elon will have some sort of non-model 3 announcement aimed at distracting attention from the model 3 and justifying a capital raise (maybe a new factory in China, or some big solar panel announcement). Elon has been tweeting about pretty much everything but the model 3 recently. Timing the earnings call for the day after the Falcon Heavy launch also seems to play to the theme of distracting from the model 3.Hopefully, people are smart enough not to get the wool pulled over their eyes by a good showman like Elon, but don't expect Elon to go down without a fight. He undoubtedly has something up his sleeve designed to keep the cult focusing on the promised land of 2030.",

Is Tesla still on track for M3 production rate targets announced in early Jan?  [I would bet a lot the answer will be ""absolutely.""]6.  Is Tesla going to do another equity raise in 2018?7.

Highest customer satisfaction rate in the history of vehicles. The authors bias against Tesla is the only certainty here.",
"They cannot cut production for S/X, realistically.  With contracts to suppliers, and piles of parts being worth far less than cars produced - the need will be to keep the factory flowing with cars and deploying inventory in order to get cars ""out there"" ready for sale.  Even at discounts, selling cars is better than accumulating parts.  Now, if there are no margins on such sales - the issue is all it does is move money but does not solve for profits needed to pay back looming bond debt.  To pay that off, sometimes firms ""roll"" debt into new debt, sometimes at higher rates.  If the Federal funds rates go up, so will new bond rates and as such, the rolling of bonds because of a lack of profits means further indebtedness with an unable-state to pay back using profits.  In other words, their success may ultimately be their failure.  Having to keep pumping out cars that are not full-priced custom orders can be a financial drain.  it saturates the market, pushes for fleet-discounting to taxi companies and others all in the name of making a sales-unit number (forget making a profit).",

The implication is clear: if I can afford to pay the tab for everybody in here, then I am the greatest and richest con artist ever.

My expectation is that tesla won't give any kind of Q1 guidelines instead give for full year or half year guides like last year and it will be very vague without giving much details like by product line or anything specific as the numbers for s and x looks not good at all so only positive spin would be total car sales incl. model 3.

"Hi JohnIn general I agree with your comments..But, as a veteran of healthcare stocks that find a way to get crosswise with the cameras, I think the sustained recovery-(assuming they weather the storm)-in the stock price is based more on the digestion of bad new by investors, traders, and others-including the management. The pattern I have seen over the years usually involves a series of negative events erratically spread over time that have diminishing effect on the stock price. There is not set rule, but regardless of investigative zeal by someone like Schneidermann, sooner or later there will be a day when the stock has digested the negatives or at least balanced them against the fundamental or other positive events and it will no longer go down. So, it is this equilibrium point that I am looking for.. Multiples, of sales, earning, cash flow--all important fundamentals are important, but the equilibrium needs to be reached before any of this comes back into focus. This is a political year and my concern is that there are many, many more Schneidermann look alikes waiting in the wings to have their 15 minutes of fame and national headlines. And, you have the Federal Suit against John Kapoor. Let me make myself clear on Dr. Kapoor. He is without question one of the most successful entrepreneurs in making a silk purse from a sow's ear. He is a genius proven repeatedly over the decades to be a master of niche marketing in an unremarkable area of generic pharmaceuticals-noted for commodity thinking CEO's.  Not Kapoor-He is strictly a value added brand builder the likes of which has little parallel especially in this commodity area. I have known him since the formative days of Lyphomed-and can testify he will survive this storm and win the day..

My emphasis has been on TRx instead of NRx since I thought pricing was on basis of pills sold, but GILD said in last call that price has changed to price of 8 week treatment, so NRx may be better number to track $$ spent.  If so, ABBV is doing better than I was assuming, since its NRx is up to ~34.75% of total market, with GILD at 62.84% of NRx total.  With GILD's guidance, we should not be surprised that its numbers continue to decline.  The issue is whether there is a bottom, and, if so, where is it.  COMMENTS by Rocky3",

"DoctoRx, As a long Gild & GSK holder I want to thank you for your great insight and research. Reviewing GSK's, MRK's, Abbv's and Gild's HIV and HCV sales I'm concerned based on the following:1.) HIV: GSK (VIIV) (Triumeq & Tivicay) continue to grow in market share. Total ViiV HIV sales in '17 reached $6.1B (ex $1.39/1£) or ~30% of the GILD & GSK market. Growth (Triumeq & Tivicay) in local currency for the year was  47% and 42% respectively. In the 4th quarter growth slowed to 38% and 23%, respectively. I am concerned that ViiV continues to grab market each year. 2.)HCV: total '16 sales were $16.9B: MRK $0.6B, Abbv $1.5B and Gild $14.8B.              total '17 sales were $12.1B: MRK $1.7B, Abbv $1.3B and Gild $  9.1B.Per the conference calls MKR predicts a drop in sales in '18 from its Q4 rate of sales of $296M were as Abbv forecasts an increased rate of sales from its Q4 sales of $510M. Gild also forecast sales in '18 will decrease from its Q4 rate of sales of $1,496M.Based on the HCV '18 forecast's from Gild of $3,750M plus Abbv's of over $2,500M and assuming  Mrk sales of $1,000M the total Hcv sales would be $7,250M or a decrease of 40% from total '17 Hcv sales!  Ouch!",

But I feel that GILD is one of only a very few investments I have that actually look like fair value in this market, and you have added to my confidence in this belief.",
"Excellent as always DocHere's an absolutely crazy thought. In hindsight, they should've created a privately held subsidiary for the HCV franchise and never reported any of the wins or losses. Then accumulate the enormous amount of cash and acquire KITE. GILD would be trading at a P/E of 18-22 had they simply kept rolling along with HIV and never told the world about the HCV discovery. That is a sad statement. I do love the dividend and selling OTM calls. It's stable and even in a crash is pretty safe.",

"DoctoRx, As always well done. Of particular interest to me were your two points about strategy.  The first made me laugh...""CEO ending one conference call by telling analysts that GILD actually had a strategy, but would keep it to itself (the ""go jump in a lake"" strategy of public relations), and by a different executive taking a minute or two to complete a simple thought due to continual um's and ah's."" Of course, we now know the strategies were and will remain a growth through acquisitions and furthering the existing pipeline.  That management was reticent might be a matter of timing or irritation.  Having been involved in Q&A with media, I can assure you irritations arise but so does the need to not say somethings because the timing is not right.  While it makes one look evasive, it is by design.Secondly, the point made about first mover advantages is most notable, in no small measure because of Gilead's existing reputation for science.  Even with other competitors seeking development of their drugs in CART-T, a first mover sets up the technical standard and this creates a barrier.  Given that it is unlikely loyalty would impair first mover status in this case, it is similarly unlikely that what Gilead is doing is easily copied.  So it is that first mover status should allow Gilead a larger market capture before later movers enter.  Just my 2 cents.",
"The best thing happening to Gilead is that HCV revenues will be shrinking to less than $1 B quarterly this year.  If they come in at $3.7 B this year and are only $1.0 B lower next year, the decline should be easily overcome by growth in HIV and CAR-T.  The resumption of growth should merit a P/E of around 15.  I estimate EPS of $7.50 this year based on $21.5 B revenues and net income of $9.9 B.  At a P/E of 15, the stock should trade at $112.  Any positively viewed acquisition should boost this target.",

"""Meanwhile, HCV sales have fallen off a cliff and can't get up without a ton of help from China, of which the company said nothing.""This 'cliff falling' happened a couple of years ago. It's already started to stabilize - ie: reached the bottom of the cliff.",
"Good article doc.  My thoughts:Their expected HCV revenue decline this year to $3.5-4.0 B (from $9.1 B last year) was no surprise, since they had suggested as much in their last report. The reason however is now clear - fierce competition from Mavyret leading to drastic price cutting.  Patient starts are in a slow decline, but are only a minor contributor to the revenue decline.  The good news is that next year should see relative stabilization with HCV revenues falling perhaps to $3 B.I think that they should do around $0.5 B in Yescarta this year, based on their comments of an available pool of 80% of 7500 patients, and only being able to treat a small portion of these.  Maybe $1.0 B next year.  So with HIV growing, 2019 should definitely see growth over 2018.I agree that the stock is range bound until the next breakthrough - probably an acquisition in the first half of this year.",

Excellent analysis!I enjoy owning GILD and taking a longer term view. With BIC hopefully launching in days I like the HIV business. Really it is the history of great achievements along with the cash and ongoing cash generation that gives me a long term positive view.The good thing about HCV is it cant likely crash much more and if it does few will care. I wonder however if their is upside potential with current levels much lower than I thought possible? On the scientific and business side few could have done a better job of capturing a market than GILD did in HCV or HIV. It is that extraordinary strategy success that I suspect will one day be employed again in one of many areas GILD is researching.The decline period I think is ending and stable to growing revenue could value GILD higher than current levels.,
"As always, Doc... clear, concise and sensible. There is no place for that in today's world. Stop it immediately.Seriously, the dividend kick is about what I expected... continue to believe the company will spend much more on the divvy than on stock buybacks this year.And I'd guess that the failure of any analyst to ask about China is simply a recognition that nobody has the slightest idea what will happen there. Management has answered previous questions on that subject with the lengthy verbal equivalent of a palm's-up shrug, and nothing has happened recently to provide any visibility on that market at all.",

"1. Company has said in past that they need to sell 350 Argus per year just to break even, so even with latest sales per Q of 30, that's only 1/3 of what they need. And CMS cut reimbursement for all of 2018 from $155K to around $122K. When CMS cut rate for 2016, the company had to discount for the entire year, which hurt sales. So they may not keep up that 30 number now that we're in the new year with the lower rate.2. If Orion doesn't work, or there are any problems with any of the few test subjects, it's doubtful the company can survive with so many others competing now, some with apparently better tech and higher quality vision provided for retinal implants and RP patients.Bottom line: It's now wait and see on Orion data, which will take many months; all the while continuing to lose money and continuing to dilute via the ATM they set up to fund Orion trials and pay bills.I expect it to range around 1.80 to 2.00 until the ER and CC, and, hopefully, some clarity and more info. May get a small pop if they're able to reopen the factory on new Argus sales, but they're going to have to talk about the dilution and mention all the risks with next-gen Orion. I'd also like to know why the long delay on the first Orion implant that they promised by the end of 2017. Were there problems, or did the patient have second thoughts? IR said they wouldn't put out PR until the ""patient was stable"" following surgery, so if the impant took place the end of January, it evidently took a while for the patient to recover and stabilize; at any rate, a lot longer than with Argus surgery. Like to hear about all that.Not seeing a lot of volume today, so looks like it's not going to run off this news, and it already doubled in anticipation, so I'm guessing it'll take the ER before any real direction is set. It's never held a gain even with good news in the past, but maybe this latest news is enough to at least keep it from tanking, but shorts have been ruthless on this for a long time, and I expect some will take a shot at it.I'm gonna wait until the ER to think about buying back in.

"3025 Suite - thanks for the info and clarification - I did not know/ understand this - what you say appears pretty bad! If KLDX can not identify high quality reserves for leveraging their narrow vein expertise - what is the point?  Or - that is the point of the depressed sp.Ok, bad news is bad news etc.  - what is worse and more disturbing is fundamental uncertainty created by insecure management that is playing hide the ball with investors - which opens up potential legal issues (lawsuit opportunist behavior/ shareholder derivative suits/increases transactions costs) and adds risk particularly for retail investors - and provides further opportunities for narrative shaping/ trading activities of shorts or others that have special access to non-public information - I think.  Again thanks for info. JohnSounds like managements playing hide the ball with investors - never a good sign",
"Question: Is one way to interpret the KLDX drilling results update of 2/6/2018 – that KLDX is simply fulfilling its duty of disclosure regarding ongoing activities?  Essential is this just legal SEC CYA regarding disclosure of marginal material information.  Yes, the info may be nothing to write home about – but is that something that management would be expected to comment to specifically? The results on the one hand appear to be a “nothing burger” – that shows that KLDX has been successful in identify lower grade reserves – and which perhaps plays to the ongoing narrative of a broken Company core value proposition re. expertise at narrow vein mining.  The update obviously is not news that long investors want to hear.  However, the news arguably provides an added opportunity for shorts sellers to attempt to re-enforce in the near-term the negative narrative.  The question is whether shorts will use this as an opportunity to cover or increase short positions and shake shares loose from weak hands.It is interesting to note that right now there is a relatively high KLDX short-ratio – which creates penta-up demand and potential for a short-squeeze in the future.  If the conventional wisdom from the mainstream financial media is wrong about the macroeconomics of rising long-term interest rates, increasing debt, leveraged margin speculation, the assumptions about the economic “recovery” since 2008 etc., etc. . . . and the implications of the recent/ ongoing stock market sell-off – there could be a counter-intuitive significant (perhaps imminent) short-squeeze and emergent narrative inversion regarding this name (i.e. a new inverted narrative is that it is fundamentally a quality oversold, low cost, experienced known junior miner with a clean balance sheet that can with stand broader stock market and debt deflation) that will cause KLDX share price to perhaps take-off like a scalded-chimp and temporarily make JNUG look like it is standing still – without perhaps the leveraged ETF risk of the latter.In any case it seems that the main KLDX bad news is out – the latest incremental news is not good news, but it also may be discounted as “no news” which is not necessarily bad for KLDX.Sorry for the long question and comment.  Use or lose as you see fit.  Thanks again for article and the other contributor comments.",

Seems like  KLDX is a bit over sold - bad news is out - and if the general equity up action today is just a bounce that is not going be sustained or be able to fight rising rates (e.g. the 10 yr US Treasury).It sounds like it is going to be a make or break year for the KLDX management team's dwindling legacy reputation - if they over promise/ under deliver again - i.e. KLDX will be a left-for-dead junior minor unless they get lucky re. a major bump in PMs.Just some thoughts.

"General Mills is truly old, it may be fairly valued but it certainly has not been boring recently! Riding this stock up from the $30s to above $70 in less than four years was quite exhilarating.  Riding it back down to the low $50s over the last year and a half has not been much fun.It may be true that GIS is fairly valued at current levels, but I'm not sure. With the current level of sales growth, I'm not sure GIS warrants its P/E.  I'm also not sure I want to bet on the quality of this company's capital allocation strategies.  Management has thrown away years worth of money that could have been used to re position its product lines. Over the last few years they have paid exorbitant prices to buy back shares to show better earnings per share.  Over that period they have paid premium prices to departing shareholders, I being one, having received more than $70 possibly from company coffers for most of my shares in 2016. I sold the balance for $55.43 last June.  The GIS chart, used by the author, showing historic total stock return is quite interesting in its construction.  If they were to show performance through 2017 rather than 2016 it would look far worse, since 2017 was a year of negative return, with a drop in price of 5% ($62-59) and a $1.96 dividend paid,  I think GIS shares also trailed the S&P total return by a significant amount in 2017.For 2018 I would hope for some growth in total sales with at least steady margins, but I'm not sure we can rely on that.  I'd also hope management stops buying back shares unless the share price drops significantly below $50.For me to buy back into GIS I think I need management to evidence a turn around in sales for a few quarters.  Until that jump in sales occurs I would need a distribution yield of more than 4%.  There is no reason to believe that this company will increase its value more than the rate of inflation over the next two years.",

Great piece. The last few days have been tough to sort through but you explained things in a really clear manner. Thanks for this article.,

Just one question: you provide a thorough section on the value of a mileage business, versus the value of a float of a poorer business like Sainsbury's (you mention in the comments that Sainsbury's float was ""much more ‘solid’ cash liability than Aeroplan miles""). But then you suggest that one possibility for Aeroplan post-2020 might be to expand ""with the addition of new earning partners, anchored specifically around its current weakness in non-discretionary retail, and to a lesser extent in retail generally. For example, Aeroplan hasn't had a grocery partner since 2015, when Sobey's left the fold"".How does this scenario reconcile with the valuation you perform for Aeroplan post-2020? I understand that the ""lower quality"" (or the absence) of the float in this case should be taken into account in Aeroplan's valuation, having thus a much lower valuation. Thanks in advance for your time.",
"Have a hard time understanding your bear and base cases.  You suggest the PLM is worth between $560 M - $780 M, then in your bear and base cases you value it at $300 M and $400 M.  Also, they are essentially debt free now after the $100 M pay down from the Nectar sale, plus whatever cash they generated in Q4 (to be announced next week).  So they have 2.5 years to accumulate cash for the AC deal is done, and they will only be able to save $75M - $125M in cash during that 2.5 year period?

Dividends suspended.  That's kind of where the rubber meets the sky.   I'll wait on this one.,
"Excellent analysis, with all main value levers included. A few questions:1) It sounds like Nectar sale value destruction and impact was not particularly surprising to you. I'm curious if you can provide some thoughts on it in the Comments, and how recent developments impacted remaining sizable redemption liabilities?2) I was not aware that prefs would have the right to vote in a couple of years. Is that mostly why you are including them as a de facto liability, and subtracting from the EV? It's hard to make a case that any kind of dividend, including preferred should be considered in foreseeable future, which is probably longer than two years. Because they are perpetual, in theory they can just remain as an accounting item as a forever loan that never gets paid back. But if all the other assumptions in the article hold (ie business is smaller but going concern), then certainly prefs should not be a clear and present liability. What percentage of votes would go to preferred shareholders in 2 years? And do you think that preferreds could force out mgmt or force existing mgmt to pay out dividends in arrears and effectively bankrupt the company? I'm just trying to bridge this to make sure I'm not missing anything obvious. Thanks!",

I agree the decreased rate of dividend growth and the increase in payout ration is disheartening.  I'm also continuing to hold and may sell Covered Calls against it.,
PG provides many commodities that people use and will continue to use.  Brand names are important.  I am long with PG and banking the dividend.  It may not rise and grow as fast as some of the other stocks out there but provides much value long term.,
nice article I think P&G will come back and may fool a lot of people.   do not  give up  just yet.,
Bought 1/3 of a position at 80.50 today...sooner or later we will get a real market correction at which time I will add another 1/3 at 10% down and the final one 10% below that....only way to play these big guys is to layer in over the long term.,

"This is really good analysis and it's helpful.  I have been a PG owner for some 25 years.  I've enjoyed modest growth, decent dividends and two splits in that time.  However in the last 5-8 years things have really stalled out.  I found the Peltz opposition by PG management truly discouraging.  Rather than ruining the company I think Peltz wants it to succeed and get back it's growth.  But since Peltz was not a product of the Proctoid culture management didn't want any part of him.  This is unfortunate because he just may have some good ideas about unlocking value and getting growth back.  In this internet and dot.com world dominated by Costco, Walmart and Amazon I wonder how many women are sticking with many of the old PG brands or are they buying what's on sale this week.  Many men don't shave anymore and many who do use Harry's or Dollar Shave and not Gillette.  I'm starting to wonder if the mentality at PG is not making it into the ""General Electric"" of the consumer goods sector.  I may give PG the rest of 2018 to make things great again but my patience with stodginess is not unlimited.  Long post, Sorry, but I'm a disappointed fellow.",

Why you are wondering why I have not sold?  Because last Thursday after hours I sold my short short term shares at 173.54.  I am not a complete idiot to sell my long term shares at this joke of a price...but pardon me my frustration with this mgmt team for not willing to control the narrative and letting the analysts control it.  I do not mean answer every rumor but the trend after Jan 18 was evident and silence from mgmt.  Look at Twitter today and compare that to a dead really never was going to happen super cycle with these ridiculous prices for the X.  I just want my chance at a price I can live with and wait for the inevitable collapse again because it is a gadget company.  Been thru it 2 others times and had to wait years to get out.  Not this time folks!,
"There is a very simple solution to raising Apple's SP other than firing Cook....raising the dividend to 5%.  It would remove at least another 20% of open shares off the street, preventing option traders from manipulating the SP.....",
"Look at the sp now on this tape.  Below 161.  There will never be a super cycle ever!  Also, they are so stupid that in September when they have the X plus they will price so high it will turnoff lots who would have bought it.  They would sell tons and still profit hugely if it were cheaper but this stupid mgmt team will not do that.  And that is why the super cycle will never happen.  People are wising up.  I want out before the coming collapse of this stock!",

Well let me make you aware that Goldman Saks always covered Apple, his name is/was Bill Shope, he had a buy and price target on Apple, dated April 28, 2015, of $163. So folks, wake-up and understand who is manipulating Apple shares both from an options end and SP end. It is GOLDMAN SUKS!!!!",
How many more reasons do you need why Tim Cook must be fired?  Apple is a mess right now.  Absolutely zero leadership.,
What a waste of a day thanks to Goldman stating the obvious.  The super cycle was dead on arrival.  Their price target is a disaster 161.  Fanboys will say oh goody better for buyback.  Forget buying a real company!  A buyback—-that is creative!,
Amazon up in a up market.  Now that is the way it should be.  They just grow while we depend on a cycle that never happens!,
Goldman slapped this company down.  I guess they too did not buy the 13 14 week nonsense.  Why.  Cuz the 7 needed only one more week to sell more phones last year than this cycle!  Wait we will sell more now...wait we guided down 5 billion bucks less than consensus!  There goes that!,

What fool felt not speaking about their battery decision a year ago was a good idea.  What a joke!  Keep silent mgmt.  The vacuum is the problem thus mgmt is the problem!  Stay quiet mgmt as you have learned nothing.  Next spike up and I will not hesitate to sell.  I want 170 and I will live with my stupid decision not selling at 180.  This year we will get the X plus Oled and a iPad full screen Oled pro.  This time no one will be fooled that they will sell a ton because Apple will want to make a joke margin and the retail price will make the analysts and customers puke!

I do not trust this mgmt any longer.  Buy growth...nah...buyback... creative!",
Amazon up and Apple down will be the common theme going forward.  I will bet anyone that Apple will not be the first trillion buck company.  Fanboys will say that does not matter of course it now doesn’t after mgmt could not communicate correctly with the street.  I dreamed for so long to sell in the solid 170s and I am ticked about such a lousy mgmt that cannot guide the street.  Blame the analysts fanboys but I do not as it is management job to temper expectations and not be silent.  You are 5 billion less than the street and there will not be consequences.  You are fired you imbecile ceo and cfo.,
"Great now Goldman Sachs starts coverage saying estimates too high, no super cycle, a crap 161 price target, estimates too high.  Mgmt needs to be fired their silence is the cause of letting Wall Street take over the narrative.  This company is a gadget joke.  If the market goes up today and we are because of Goldman shame on you ceo and cfo.  Both of you are joke.  All you have are buybacks.  Uncreative mgmt!  Gadget company!",

I'm speaking of the fact that they've openly indicated they want a ROW partnership for IMGN853 and at some point that should materialize.I certainly don't know when it will happen, but I don't think it will come before the futility analysis which is due this quarter, but no one I know doesn't believe the trial will continue.  As I see it, the money paid for such a partnership will depend on how close they are to anticipated approval, and of course will depend on how IMGN wants it to be structured.  More money up front certainly gets greater attention, but higher royalties might be far more lucrative in the long term.  It's uncertain if ROW will be North America, or just the U.S. as where IMGN wishes to keep the drug for itself.  We know their will be lots of additional data on the drug in combination trials well before the Phase 3 results are in.  I believe it's pretty clear that the drug performs better in combinations, so if not approved as a monotherapy, it will eventually be approved.  What I'm uncertain of is if a Phase 2 could become a registrational trial and possibly be completed even before the Phase 3 trial is completed.  In that the drug in all trials should be the same, it's of pivotal quality, so I believe such things are possible.2019 is probably optimistic for approval as I believe the company forecast 2020, but I believe it's possible.  In that the FDA takes 6 months to evaluate the BLA, and at least a few months to prepare it, the trial would need to conclude very early in 2019 to make that possible.Gary",ImmunoGen Price Run-Up Driven By Potential Clinical Trial Data

"Thomas, of course you are entitled to use your money in any way you wish, I in fact think the Starbuck’s coffee is superior to most of their competitors and I, occasionally, even buy it. That is not the point I was making above relative to the growth of the company. Every time I watch my 4dollar plus drink being made, I realize there probably is no more than 50 cents worth of material in it.  The recent price hikes in their products and the increase in coffee outlets of other vendors everywhere that Starbuck’s is expanding domestically seems to signal to me that their ability to grow in the USA is probably  In jeapordy. Growth in Europe where almost every restaurant is already a competitor seems problematic, That leaves China as the big unknown. Perhaps this will be the growth engine, but as in many other product areas, I personally think that relying on growth in China is chancy.Since I have no Starbucks stock, I have no funds at stake.

Yes Starbuck’s has prime locations in inner city dense population areas, but these are also characterized by high rent and higher labor costs. They are also saturated with too many locations in many of these areas. Since the article addresses Starbuck’s growth, it would seem that their potential for growth would be where many of their other locations are. I pointed out they are in Suburban supermarkets, highway rest stops and there the competition ‘s facilities are as good or better and the price is significantly lower. By the way, the food accompaniment offered by the Starbuck’s outlet is both expensive, full of salt content and in fact of questionable quality relative to what is available in those terrible gas station outlets to which you refer.

This environment is admittedly not as well appointed as the Starbuck’s dedicated outlets, but a coffee at half the price is an attractive alternative without waiting on line so that an 17 or 18 year old can mix an iced coffee concoction with two thirds ice  for 4dollars or more. Often there are no seats available so it’s coffee to go.  Maybe China is a big growth opportunity if the transition from relatively cheap tea to expensive coffee is successful.

Most of the sales will be digital in 3-5 years. Not only sales will be digital , focus is moving from selling titles to charging micro transactions from inside the game. PUB, Fortnite, world of tanks, Minecraft, ROBLOX all are successfully exploring micro transaction model. It is more profitable to charge for ingame goods over and over, month after month. There is no place in this model for a BM retailer. Add to this shift to mobile gaming, where content is distributed trough devices that are by design unable to accept content from external storage. You get the picture. Stock is down for a reason. There is a grim future for someone trying to make leaving on selling digital content bound to a physical storage. However there is a chance that transition would happen not that fast as market pessimists are betting. There are many reasons why people would prefer to buy games on physical storage for a relatively long time ahead of us. One reason for example “resale value” that digital games do not have. Another reason supplemental content that comes with the game (brochure, poster, stickers, maps etc). Some people just hate games with micro transaction model as they eventually end up paying more comparing with buying a game all at once. So I am long on GME. I think it will be a longer time that market thinks before digital sales completely sideline physical. For its own point BN still sell books.",
I'm in up to my neck in this stock after yesterday's correction,
"Thanks for the balanced article.  I, too, am hopeful--if not certain--that the game cycle will crank back up when the current games are replaced with others.  In the last c.c., I think I remember somebody talking about the used game cycle starting after about 180 days.  That suggests that used game sales will increase about June of '18.  If that happens, I think that will seriously blunt the bear case, and also cause shorts to rethink their position.  Long, and hangin' in.  Sincerely, V. Tucker Kirk",
I actually got some shares pre-market around 15.50 if you can believe it.  I have about 25% of my total net worth invested in GME at this point.  I think March is going to be a very good month for me.,
"You forgot to mention the agressively share repurchase that GME is doing every year.I expect GME will anounce it has repurchased at least 5-6 M shares during Q4, so total shares would be around 95M since march announcement",
I bought more GME shares yesterday. At around $16 it is great value. It seems like it might get back over $20 soon.,
"Software, both new and used, will be key IMO.-5% on preowned will hurt a lot given the margins in that business and the overall mix of business.New software has seen a resurgence of late, but it’s doubtful that story has legs unless there are additional AAA titles that are released that have the same sort of traction as what we saw in Q3/Q4. The longer term trend on new software is a straight line down due to downloads, and it only pops above zero when there’s blockbuster games released.",

Great analysis,GameStop: A Realistic Perspective
Great analysis,"Knight-Swift Shines, But Not Above Large Industry Peers"
"What is irresponsible for a contributor is to write an 'analysis' piece without a real analysis of the company - from either a scientific or business standpoint. CUE is a preclinical company and as such financials are irrelevant - they will likely need more money. Having said that, with some positive data, they may never need additional funding. They have a deal with Merck that will bring in milestones of $350m, the first likely due before they run out of money at the end of next year. The company has eluded to other drug deals and those may obviate the need for additional capital raise.What is important is the technology. If you are not a PhD or simply don't take the time to fully understand what the technology represents, don't write anything. The author makes several errors in describing the technology. He also does not look at comparable technologies that have been reported in the medical literature - look up tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and autologous t-cell transplants - to put the technology in perspective. His first sentence - ""Cue Biopharma is a recent IPO which is looking to address HPV related cancers via interleukin-2 (IL-2), activation of nascent T-cells (not CAR-T) and modulation of autoimmune systems using a novel technology"" shows a lack of understanding of the platform nature of the technology.I don't deny that this is a preclinical company with all the associated risks of preclinical companies. Unlike many other preclinical companies, CUE has in vitro human data and corollary clinical data in TIL and autologous T-cell transfers to suggest success. The NIH has for over 10 years been amplifying T-cells in a test tube and putting them back into patients and curing melanoma and other patients who have no other options. CUE can amplify T-cells in a test tube - are they the write T-cells, we'll see but they can alter the T-cell populations at will. My point is - don't write the article unless you are going to give a full assessment of the company. Don't just write an article to get your name in print and pad your resume. Restating the obvious is useless. And for the record, the author has never reached out to me to discuss the company. Quantity over quality.",
"Thank you for your response. I would suggest that you consider researching a company and trying to put out quality over quantity. Unfortunately your report really lacks scientific research and a thorough explanation of the company's science and how it relates to what is in the market an the scientific literature. Given the announcement by Nektar Pharmaceuticals today, by the time your desired human data is available on Cue, the boat will have sailed. Always happy to connect if you are truly interested in learning about the company and providing your readers with a valuable evaluation.",
"Interesting article but the author clearly has only performed a cursory understanding of CUE, likely based solely on his reading of the S1 and not actually talking with the company. One of the drawbacks of Seeking Alpha is the lack of real research done by authors.I have invested in CUE during both of the private rounds and again at the IPO and am a long holder of CUE. The author doesn't fully understand the MOD/viraTope platforms (they are fairly independent and separate from the drug development platform) and misses the point of the drug development platform. The difference between CUE 101 and CUE 200 lies in the ability to overcome tumor microenvironment T-cell suppresive mechanisms without other therapeutics (ie PD-1 inhibitors). Bottom line, a key event for CUE will be a small study in humans to determine the effectiveness of the drug. If the initial trial is successful, the pipeline can quickly be enhance to over 70 drugs (by company report). In addition, the test tube experiments with CUE 101 provide a significant excitement as this feat lines up with NIH studies in adoptive immunotherapy. If you are interested in learning more, check out the CEO's presentation last year http://bit.ly/2BU8T9S and sign up for Tuesday's company presentation. Suffice it to say, there is a chance that the company may never have to dilute further and by the time there is data, a significant inflection may have been missed. Don't get me wrong, there is still high risk - but it is a company with multiple shots on goal through drug and antigen discovery and has demonstrated, as best as possible at this stage of evolution, human efficacy that has in other realms resulted in clinical efficacy.",
"Definitely interesting technology.  Seems like it is more likely to be a competitor with TIL or adoptive cell transfer technology before we start comparing it to CAR-T though.  The ex vivo editing for CARs and TCRs is definitely a pain, but those drugs are incredibly potent as a result.  Bispecific immune modulators are looking more and more promising though, so who knows where this could be in a few years.  I'll be watching this stock.  I expect there to be many dirt cheap entry points for a stock like this that has already gone public without any drugs in actual clinical development.  Thanks for the overview!",

"This is a great article focusing on the INVESTMENT case for Canopy and not the speculative one. In this, Gary, you have shown yourself to be one of the few people currently in the sector who is looking farther down the road than a day or a week. :-) You also separate yourself from the ""gurus"" who have been chased like demigods by speculators. I welcome a long analysis, even though the majority of comments following it continue to reflect the remarkable speculative short-sightedness that ultimately will hold back the entire industry if it continues.We need a lot more people looking at things long, meaning 1-5 years long, as the sector transitions away from pump and dump speculation and into an investment mindset. It is only when pot stocks get away from this whipsaw, momentum, greater fool mentality that the larger and institutional investors the industry really needs for its capitol requirements will start to step up.",
"Can someone please educate me on the opportunity that exists here at such a high price point?The OP said: ""it is a good time to grab some shares at such a low price point.""@Gary, I'm not sure I agree with your conclusions. Both this article, and your previous article do not discuss what's priced into Canopy's stock at the moment.Numbers matter: At $21 a share (the price when this post went live), the implied valuation is 6.8x FY20 revenues being projected by analysts at $514MM. Why do you believe this is a good entry price for anyone? Canopy may be the best in the industry, but even the best in an  industry can become egregiously overvalued. The stock sells for 50x FY20 expected earnings of $0.42; why does this look cheap to you Gary?Don't misintepret the tone of my statements. I am as optimistic as anyone can be about the prospective growth in the cannabis space, but I'm not a fool (and I'm not calling you one either). Keeping things realistic: if the stars align and Canopy generates $2BN in FY25, the stock still trades (on current EV) at 1.75x such an optimistic outcome. Canopy doesn't look cheap at all if you treat it like a traditional retail growth business. Those of you who purchased shares at prices below $12 did a fantastic job; I wish I had started reading about this industry sooner but I was several months too late to this party. I'm not saying that Canopy won't generate $2BN of revenue (or even $10BN), but the valuation is too high at this price. Even at $12, Canopy sells for 1x annual revenue of $2BN, but at least it's probably worth that much.Why aren't you tertrified of the competitive landscape that will develop over the course of the next 10 years Gary? Why does your future expectation not price this risk in? The risk of a competitor coming up with better cannabis products and eating away at Canopy's market share over time is very real by virtue of the fact that this is a retail industry; the barriers to enter might be higher than a clothing store, but they're certainly not insurmountable by well-established businesspeople. Also, not everyone is going to be willing to sell out to a big player like Canopy, and I feel that this risk isn't priced into Canopy's valuation. What makes you believe that Canopy is worth more than today's price and that management isn't going to screw you over Gary? Managements lie. Managements have always lied in growth industries. Has there been a discussion of the dilusion of existing shareholders? Does it not bother investors that Canopy has been continuously diluting shareholders without mentioning share repurchases for the foreseeable future?  Shares outstanding has increased from 32M to 167M since they began escalating their roll-up strategy in FY15. Stock based compensation has escalated from $3.68M in FY16 to $19M in the LTM. At this rate, stock based compensation could end up as high as $330M by FY21 (440% increase per 18 months). Are you sure you want to own shares of a company that does that to its shareholders in the long-run?As it stands, when Canopy was recently priced at $34 the implied valuation was 2.87x an optimistic revenue stream of $2BN (and 81x FY20E earnings). Do you honestly believe that this is worth paying for such a risky business? Can you or anyone else please explain why this is cheap when using a real model for prospective growth? It seems preposterous to me when I accounted for the risks being faced by investors. Look at what Tesla did in the electric vehicle market in just 10 years. Am I the only person who believes that someday, a brilliant entrepreneur may come along and put Canopy's business and competitors to shame? This is a retail industry; whoever sells the best product for the best price will win. The customer is the only thing that matters. This risk is not priced into Canopy's valuation. The community needs to stop smoking the greens and start discussing a realistic path to profitability that's not yet priced-in, otherwise there's nothing to invest in; if you're going to claim that this is a good investment there has to be a real path to unstoppable long-term profitability based on a widening, NOT SHRINKING, moat. Otherwise, Canopy's price is simply disconnected from reality. Gary, what's to stop Amazon or Walmart from opening shops in Canada and destroying the competition under a subsidiary with a different and unrelated name? Does everyone want to remain blind to such a risk as well? Bear in mind that the only thing Bezos cares about is the customer and the profitability of his businesses. If he decides opening cannabis shops in Canada will be profitable, you bet your ass he'll create a venture into this space like a bunch of other behemoths at some point in the future.I can't wait to find a better name to buy that is actually cheap in this industry. I was a month late with ACBFF, and have deemed it overvalued similarly to Canopy at this point because of the same risks mentioned above, although ACBFF is less egregiously overpriced. Does this not seem like a perfect moment for investors to accept their profits and find a better name that's not priced for perfection? I'd love to buy Canopy for $12 or less based on what I've read and heard. This is a fantastic industry, but don't be foolish about allocating a percentage of your portfolios to one name when it's overvalued like this. Canopy strikes me as a pure-play on cannabis; is there some real-estate value that I'm unaware of that may increase future profitability? Are there any hidden gems that aren't being discussed in their public statements? For instance, Aurora is venturing into the sales of alcoholic cannabis-infused drinks. Is Canopy doing something similar? I'm playing devil's advocate here. I would like to view an investment in this industry through both a bullish and bearish lens, and all I see in Canopy's price is massive optimism that is completely blind to existing risk factors.Lastly, does anyone have an educated view on cannabis ETFs or what the best strategies are to mitigate the competitive risks borne by investing in this industry? Your thoughts would be much-appreciated, and I thank you in advance for your input(s).",

"CG did not get the uptick, likely they will go up after paying dividends.   Either way CG is not getting the support from the street as others since they priced their listed notes at 25 and the street simply wont give them more then 25 from the looks of it. Interesting to see what happens today when KKR reports. expect more of an upside after earnings.",
"A couple things -- Carlyle pays distributions, not dividends. They are variable.  Also, CG is a publicly traded partnership and a lot of individuals and even some institutions prefer not to invest in them given the tax treatment. This can (in theory) limit upside potential. Also - there has been weak growth in their global credit (formerly known as global market strategies) and investment solutions (formerly alpinvest) segments. The failed hedge fund purchases are still dragging on their results but they should be clear going forward. I am long CG, by the way, and have been since the IPO. I just think its important to recognize their misses as well as their hits.",
"2015 and 2016 were rough years for CG, but nice to see them back on track.I liked their fundamentals well enough to establish a stake in the $15s and have enjoyed a very nice ride up.Like the author, I see lots of future upside......I expect it should easily reach $30 in 2018, and believe it has a solid chance to do so in H1",

"TVP,Nice summary of CG.  I agree that their stock is undervalued due to their growing AUM.

"CG is a value play in its sector and is still trading far below peers such as BX and APO.  CG fair value is around 30 to 32 per share.  Dividends are nice but I have been in this stock for its growth potential, very pleased with the results. As for deals, CG has one of the strongest international networks and therefore is very often beating other funds to the punch globally. Also a very strong management  team that is continuing to outperform many of its peers on deal flow.  CG is still highly underated and would not be surprised to see the stock trade consistently in mid 30s in next 6 to 12 months.",

I just went & watched again the CEO talking on CNBC in the most recent interview a couple days ago.So now I have changed my mind.  I don't think it was brokers looking to get more borrow fees.I think the final two days was an honest to goodness short squeeze performed maybe by hedge funds and momo traders.  If you listen to the CEO he clearly wanted to deliver this message:  there are 23M shares shorted.  (this is waaaay more than the float)  He is fighting the short sellers!  He is growing EBITDA at 150%!  He clearly wanted to fuel a short squeeze.And also maybe he was doing some wash trading to help the squeeze along.  I think they had a plan to dump the remaining shares and get out of dodge within days.  I'm very happy the SEC took immediate action here.  Not doing so probably would have allowed these guys to get away with their whole scam... which was a very simple scam.  Amazing they got as far as they did.,

However, Schwab & iShares are not adding.  Vanguard is opaque it seems & not sure about fidelity.  Maybe there are mutual funds?  Or a long ETF tail?    Also I have an email from IR on friday now claiming 6.79M float, which is what morningstar reports.  However the BB terminal has LFIN at 2.45% free float and that is only counting A shares.  Add in B shares and you get to the 1.45% free float.  crazy. Cheers-Matt",

"""If the share float doesn't increase before early May which is when the payments will likely start, those payments in shares will make Longfin's share float grow very quickly and will likely pressure the stock.""This is an intriguing thesis because it provides us with timing, the hardest thing to get right when shorting companies like LFIN.I'm completely unfamiliar with this sort of financing, and find the language of the filing difficult to follow. Nonetheless I've attempted to model the above scenario using some simplifying assumptions. Please let me know if I've erred:-The underlying equity is worthless, and the stock is simply a gambling vehicle. Because of this its PPS will be proportional to its public float (3.5M shares).-Each of the 18 monthly installments are paid in $2,927,777 worth of stock, with a conversion price equal to 88% of the current PPS, or $8 (whichever is greater).-Crypto-mania is still strong, and the PPS on the first day of payment (4/22) is $25.My results (http://bit.ly/2BPAYyZ) are that the float won't even double by the time financing is done. If the PPS starts at <= $8, the float will increase 2.6x.It seems to me the IPO lockup expiration would be a bigger contributor to LFIN's downfall, whenever that is? Why wouldn't they just do secondary offerings like RIOT has done?",

The fundamental econ problem is there is no Ethereum hedge/futures for currency fluctuations as giant as that of Ethereum. How can two companies make an exchange in Ethereum, which has a huge variability in exchange rates and an opaque and manipulated market (as seen in the Tethers controversy)?  They don't need to build a fully-functioning, secure and AML/KYC and best-practice security compliant Ziddu, because no one who is a legitimate business will ever in their right mind bother to use it.  Instead it appears to be an exercise in checking off buzzwords and pretending something is happening, when one address as of a few days ago owns 98% of the ZWHC Ziddu warehouse token, and basic two-factor auth and standard crypto-exchange security mechanisms are not in place.  Reset your password on the ziddu site, and it sends your password in unencrypted form in a plain text email. No security specialist worth their salt would claim the site was even ready for beta.  No human confirms the ""KYC"" document uploaded before preventing user interactions to deposit Ethereum. Looking on their token explorer - only a few transactions have occurred sometimes days apart - and no clear documentation for how any customer could possibly use the site for transactions.  Just enough is implemented for implausible deniability - deniability if the entire staff are a bunch of morons with no fintech processes for securing their implementation. Just yesterday, before any 1st Q ER, the CEO fired their India-based auditor (?! who bizarrely were listed in the site meta description keywords for search engines - independent auditor hah), and replaced with a new one.  In the SEC filed-document, there is lack of clarity in how the transition is occurring. One red flag among countless others. This stock should not be listed on a major US exchange.  The longfin public site has no obvious contacts for sales  and you know customers, those people who make businesses money. The news section tries to mislead that there are a bunch of independent stories posted on MSNBC and other places, when they are mostly PR pieces that then link to the same ""Source"" PR they wrote on a PR newswire on MSNBC etc.  Everything stinks to high heaven and yet mysteriously their stock is staying remarkably steady for being so purely awful. If this stock is above $1, and it isn't just the low 13% float and some other shenanigans that will be discovered later (the India business involve stock trading I believe)  - US markets are destined for a large crash if this is the canary in the coal mine of how terrible some of the assets are making up NASDAQ's market cap, rather than worst outlier.

If I could get a decent answer to that question, I could maybe find the opportunity more tempting.  And that answer can't be something like ""well, they need the cash around to fund new investment opportunities.""  They're own stock is an investment opportunity!  Let's say their current P/B ratio of ~0.5 is way off and they should trade at like 1x BV, well, that's a 50-cent dollar for them to buy right there!  All they have to do is pick it up off the ground - no risk!  Why don't they do it, being such astute capital managers?  And their buy-back program needs to be something much more than $25 million, or 6% of the outstanding stock mentioned in the article.  Why don't they buy back like 30% or even more?  Their not doing this suggests one of two things: (1) they're not as good of capital allocators as they'd have us believe, or (2) they shouldn't really trade at something like 1x BV and maybe their stock is trading much closer to its fair value than appearances might suggest.  Neither option really bodes well for the attractiveness of the opportunity.  Please someone tell me why I'm wrong.",

I hope to God he's wrong, it would be the death of one of America's most important (strategically and innovatively) companies.

"Good article, will hold for now. I don’t mind either outcome, Qualcomm standalone or with Broadcom is great investment.",
"Can someone confirm the process? I assume that AVGO have been going around QCOM major shareholders looking for support and assessing the right level to price their bid. Those same shareholders will then put pressure on QCOM management to recommend the bid and put it to all shareholders in a vote. If management don't listen to their major shareholders at this point, then they are out. So it is the major shareholders that decide whether management will support this or not. No? I don't see that management have free will here.",

go for $82 an walk away.,
How is it under valued? QCOM was valued at 52 dollars before the rumor of AVGO came along. QCOM is predicting $0.65 - $0.75 non-GAAP for the next Q. GAAP is a loss for now. Walstreet estimates are less than 4 dollars which turns to be less than 50 dollars per stock.How can they earn double in a year? What is changing drastically? None that can create a new revenue source. 1B dollar saving? QCOM yearly non-GAAP is 6B. So 1B is like 16%. Where are the other 84% coming from?So far none of the analysts updated their estimates. In directly Walstreet is calling it as a BS. Let me give you another number. AAPL iphone revenue is 140B per year and worldwide smart phone revenue is 500B. If QCOM is charging AAPL 4B and their total licensing revenue is less than 5B what does that tell you? QCOM does not charge anything to the other companies...Thats all AAPL needs to show win the law suit.,
"The bid looks good but still under valued. If Qualcomm management made clear cases how they will deliver 2019 $7 eps. Out of these the last item makes most promising, resolution of disputes, which implies the end is near.

"I'm a small investor and I'm tired of apples manipulation of Qcom. From my posistion, $82 offers. a 40% gain and I'm in.",
"How does anyone say whether QCOM had a winning agreement with Samsung. I am sure details of royalty payments will not be revealed. QCOM was in trouble in Korean court that would have fined them a large sum (like close a 1 B dollars). So they reached an agreement to give some huge discounts to Samsung securing their business with Samsung (win win for both) and bad for AAPL (Samsung getting discounts would hurt them). So AAPL decided INTC chips would be enough with their own software and technology. Basically QCOM gave away huge discounts to Korean and Chinese companies because it was losing the court/regulatory battle. AAPL says lets try our luck in the US court. Initial verdicts did not go in QCOM's way.QCOM is the only high tech company on earth that is relying on patent royalties, law suits and influence of their patent muscles to stay dominant for more than 20 years. Patent expires, their influence declines. Even after all these their margin is low (APP chip and patent royalties should be high margin, even the modem should be because the technology is old/proven/settled). AVGO knows they can increase the margin. So they offered 82 dollars. QCOM management knows their revenues are not going up. So they guided low immediate earnings and very high 2019 earnings. It makes no sense. Market does not believe in QCOM management's 2019 earnings prediction. Otherwise the stock would be worth 80-90 dollars.Market is saying1) QCOM management is going to reject the offer so that they will have the control of the company2) Their 2019 earnings is a bluff. QCOM is going to earn 4 dollars or lower. Hence the 60 dollars price.3) If AVGO cannot win against QCOM management, the stock will go down to 50 dollars (yes even with close to 4 dollars earnings, the growth is slowing, there are lawsuits and AAPL business will be gone).There is no way rejecting the offer is good for any investor. Otherwise that guy would be buying like crazy at 60 dollars. People asking for rejecting the offer are small investors or QCOM insiders.",
"what is the assurance that AVGO new management can run the QCOM efficiently during the regulatory process, considering the candidates of AVGO choice for BoD of QCOM, none of them have any significant experience in running a Tech company of Qualcomm size, needless to say about driving innovation in wireless. Can AVGO show any product line in wireless could create dominant position for them in the next  wireless generation, which they recently developed after Broadcom acquisition, a big NONE. so, it clearly shows their operational model doesn't work for more than 2-3 years. Its already started reflecting in RFFE (good to say, started with ,..). Now, they are in a desperate situation to sustain or to cover up their in-efficiency from buying QCOM in cheap. Needless to remind, the dominant position of QCOM in wireless has created and is continuing under the same management for years now. During the lows, everyone enjoyed the 3.6 yield/returns in dividends. LONG QCOM, 2019 EPS of $7 (mid value) is not too far.",
"Answer the simple question. If AVGO offer was taken off the table, how much QCOM stock will be today? My prediction is that it will be valued at 50 dollars (less than 52 dollars when the first AVGO rumors started).There is no way QCOM is growing double in 18-19 months. Their guidance is low. If they are earning 5 dollars this year, they are unlikely to earn more than 7 dollars next year.QCOM has been very successful acquiring technologies from 2G to 3G and acquiring application chip technologies. They lost some ownership in 4G and will lose more in 5G. They are losing patent fights all over the world except US. It is going to be hard to fight AAPL and china.As an investor I would rather take 82 dollars instead of 50 dollars today.",
I see this as nothing but a trick to try and get elected to the board. The 10 billion if deal falls through? That has to be backed by Apple lol,
The problem with this proposal from a long-term perspective is it cuts costs right as the wireless opportunities will be exploding. That's not a good plan.Smart capitalists dump R&D into emerging opportunities. I'm opposed to this deal on that principle alone. I want the US to lead the way into 5G and beyond and have put my money where my mouth is. Now let it play out.,
"QCOM will prevail, except AAPL nobody likes this deal",
"Great article. Probably not a coincidence that Apple announced they may not use Qualcomm products going forward the same day that Broadcom announced a higher bid, yesterday. Qualcomm management has done a great job and clearly cares deeply about the long term prospects of the company. I want to own Qualcomm long term as a standalone, dividend paying company. Broadcom while impressive strikes me as a rollup company, hope they don't end up like Valeant or Kinder Morgan.",
"Apple announces their (ridiculous) intent to single-source Intel modems at exactly the same moment as BRCM swoops in for another bid?  If I had odds like that, I'd be raking it in at Vegas.  How is this not the very definition of market manipulation?",
I plan to vote my shares to accept the $82 offer.,
"Stone Fox,Fair overview of the current situation. Since I’m also long Apple and Qcom, been debating whether my decision is being affected by the other. Currently, I think that Qcom should accept the present offer because it is basically a guaranteed win over a vast unknown. It should immediately improve relations with Apple, it establishes NXP to either accept or reject the current offer instead of hoping that Qcom may sweeten deal, just to get it done. The breakup fee guarantees that they can’t lose, if they can’t pass regulatory scrutiny. Add in the fact that it’s quite possible that the Qcom board could be replaced a month from now, if they don’t accept.",
"They don't make a good case for the failures of current management IMO. The fact that Qualcomm has been attacked by a powerful player in the industry who wants to pay less for the IP is really not an indictment of management, no matter how many pundits criticize them for being in a dispute with a ""customer"". Qualcomm will prevail on the legal front and get an agreement like the one they have just signed with Samsung (a true customer) and a lot of folks will wonder in a couple of year what some investors were thinking even considering a buyout from Broadcom.",
"QCOM has all the right stuff.  They just can't figure out how to run a business, except to enrich management.  They've bought back millions of shares over the years, but still have more shares outstanding than they did before all the buybacks.  Not hard to figure out where that all went.  They are tremendously ingenious, but have a business plan that ticks off their customers and makes them look like patent trolls.  I like QCOM as a standalone company, but let's face it - their management is lacking (in everything except enriching themselves at shareholder expense).  If they can't produce the earnings they are claiming, it's time to replace management.",

I think Tesla is only talking with SQM/Corfo about getting lithium supply, not talking to Nutrien about the SQM stake.... And, potentially upgrading any production they get from SQM to battery-grade lithium in Chile or even manufacturing battery cells (b/c Chilean gov't officials are pushing for value-added upgrading to be done domestically, not necessarily b/c Tesla wants to build a factory in Chile).",
"Folks,To make you TSLA share holders feeling better, your CEO, Elon Musk, if is not going to get paidunless certain milestones are met if it does happen, he will get paid $10B or more. Either way not that much meat lies on the table for share holders.It is a cult stock.No position.",
"Why do people keep assuming that Tesla makes battery cells?  Tesla does NOT produce battery cells so they have no use for a Lithium mine.   Tesla's past ability to raise capital does not assure their future ability to do so.  They have had two quarters of massive losses since the last capital raise.   Why would they would have messed around with the recent $550M deal, which was essentially the sale of ~9,000 leased cars, if they had the option of just selling more stock?",
